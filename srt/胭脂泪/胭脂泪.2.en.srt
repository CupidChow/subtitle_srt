The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Master, I heard footsteps on the right.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Where?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Second Young Master passed by.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's go.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Second Young Master

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can only take one shot.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's raining.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Madam, why are you...

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Second Young Master, help me.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Second Young Master, I just heard that there was a sound in your room.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Did something happen?

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Nothing.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There was a cat passing by.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It just came in.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Young Master, do you want to go in and handle it?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's just a cat.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It looks pitiful.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If there's nothing else, I'll go over there.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you, butler.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you for earlier.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll go now.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Madam, don't you want to explain?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I went to the backyard to find lost items.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I didn't expect to bump into a ghost.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was scared and came back.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But I was afraid that they thought it was a ghost I had.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So I had to hide from you.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then why did you stop?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll believe you.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're the most kind and reliable person in the whole Zhou Manor.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, really?

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They just left.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You should go now.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wait.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The wound on your neck...

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It was a wound from the bamboo outside the house.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll get the medicine for Madam.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is from my teacher, Yang Wen.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's very useful.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It only takes one night.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There won't be any signs of it tomorrow.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't take things back.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Can you help me apply the medicine?

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll apply the medicine for Madam.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Does it hurt?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's alcohol in the medicine.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Bear with it.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When I was hiding under the table,

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I saw some carving works.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Were they made by you?

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you doing?

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Please don't tell Father.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll throw them away.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why?

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I think they're very good.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Those are just bad things for your parents.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You don't have to blame yourself for other people's expectations.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I won't tell anyone.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm looking forward to your next work.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The medicine is ready.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How can wood carving be a job?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The table and bed we use,

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and the carvings on the cabinets.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If I could have such a good craft,

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I wouldn't have to work in the house.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have what I like to do.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can do it well.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're amazing.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I really admire you.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't worry.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll keep the secret for you.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's you again.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're finally home, Madam.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've been waiting for you for so long.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why did you come to my house this late at night?

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
To deliver the medicine.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,640
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,640
You're hurt, aren't you?

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,680
I feel sorry for your father.

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
You came to my room

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,360
in the middle of the night just to deliver medicine?

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Or what?

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
On the night of the wedding,

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
what do you want me to do?

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,280
Wuyi Tai.

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,400
Master sent me to find you.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,760
Are you asleep?

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,000
Open the door.

95
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Are you feeling guilty?

96
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,080
Wuyi Tai, are you there?

97
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,200
You should be guilty.

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
If you don't open the door,

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,680
how can Master come in?

100
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
We're in the same room.

101
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,440
Stay in the bed.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't go anywhere.

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Yes, Madam.

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Really?

105
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,520
It's so late.

106
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,920
Is there anything wrong with Steward Xu?

107
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,360
I've already fallen asleep.

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,400
Master told me to come and deliver the medicine.

109
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,560
Thank you.

110
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,040
By the way,

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,160
I heard the noise outside.

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
Did something happen?

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,600
It should be the shadow of the night.

114
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,040
Wuyi Tai was shocked

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,040
when he saw the light.

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,320
Don't worry.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
I sent more people to patrol the house.

118
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,760
It's very safe.

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,200
That's good.

120
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
We'll leave now.

121
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,840
Go.

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,040
Uncle, where did you get this jade pendant?

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,520
He must have seen the pendant

124
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
of my sister.

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
I got this pendant

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,320
from his grandmother.

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
It's not something valuable.

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
But there are two rows of jade on it.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,200
I like it very much.

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
Let's each take one

131
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,920
and give ourselves a break.

132
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,200
My business is more important than yours.

133
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm free to do whatever I want.

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,960
He has already doubted my identity.

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,160
He must not come to deliver the medicine so easily.

136
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,920
Then the ghost must be related to him.

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
But Wuyi Tai is his daughter.

138
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,880
What does he want?

139
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,160
Father,

140
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,920
Mother made this herself.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,080
She thought

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,440
you always talked about the peach blossom cakes in your hometown.

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,320
So Mother...

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,920
Put it there.

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,600
It's not for you.

146
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,480
Master,

147
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Wuyi Tai reminded you to take the medicine on time.

148
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,840
By the way,

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,760
I heard that he saw a ghost last night.

150
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280
What happened?

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,440
We've checked the house.

152
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,880
There's nothing strange.

153
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,440
I think Wuyi Tai must have seen it.

154
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,020
Ah.

155
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,320
That's good.

156
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,960
Come to see someone who's powerful

157
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
and correct the situation

158
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,600
and I will disobey him.

159
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,800
I've been going easy on him lately.

160
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,480
The silly girl he is.

161
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
She must have lost her mind.

162
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,760
Master.

163
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Greetings, Master

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,280
You Young Master

165
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,920
Jiawu

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Your clothes

167
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Fal QUO

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
Looks beautiful

169
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,000
That one

170
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,760
Clothes are not so expensive

171
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,920
I'm the one who made them

172
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
What a hand

173
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
Master, you have to help me.

174
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,840
You want to kill me?

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,720
Uncle, what are you doing?

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,680
Master,

177
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
do you know who is trying to kill me?

178
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,000
It's him.

179
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,720
I almost died yesterday.

180
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,080
Madam,

181
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,360
it's not fair.

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
We need to prove our innocence.

183
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
Of course I have evidence.

184
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I found it in the backyard of the house last night.

185
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,440
His personal bag

186
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,400
and his name on it.

187
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,120
You're lying to me.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,040
So what?

189
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,760
Wu,

190
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
what's going on?

191
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
Master,

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,080
I was in my room

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,600
since I went out last night.

194
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I never went out.

195
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,080
I only knew it when the butler sent me the medicine.

196
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,800
As for this bag,

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
is it possible that

198
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
someone prepared it in advance

199
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,720
and framed me?

200
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,000
Master,

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,600
please find out the truth.

202
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
If it's Wu Yiniang,

203
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
she was in the pond last night.

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,800
Her hair must be wet.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
The butler went to her room.

206
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,120
We'll know if her hair was wet or not.

207
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,280
Master,

208
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,080
Wu Yitai's hair was indeed wet last night.

209
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,880
Look.

210
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
It's even wet.

211
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,800
I just finished washing my hair

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
when the butler was on patrol last night.

213
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,040
It's not dry yet.

214
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,640
I can't prove that I went out

215
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
because my hair was wet

216
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,880
or even went to the backyard.

217
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,360
Yiniang.

218
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Wu Yiniang

219
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,080
Wu, get up.

220
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,880
Wu.

221
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,200
Cheng,

222
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,080
find the best tailor in Wu County

223
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,520
and choose the best fabric tomorrow.

224
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,640
Make some clothes for Wu Yiniang.

225
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,600
Yes, Father.

226
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,280
Wu,

227
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,200
don't make clothes for yourself anymore,

228
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,960
okay?

229
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,680
Brother,

230
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,160
yesterday, the whip and the ghost came again.

231
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm afraid Wu Yiniang can't stop them.

232
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,720
Master,

233
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,560
I finally

234
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,840
have a family.

235
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
Master,

236
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,200
please don't drive me away.

237
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Wu,

238
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
stay in the side room and get in the group first.

239
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,480
I'll make a decision

240
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,760
when I find the tailor.

241
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,680
Master.

242
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Please.

243
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Master, please.

244
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Are you going out for a date in the middle of the night?

245
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Why are you here?

246
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
How dare you break in like this?

247
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

248
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Afraid of being seen?

249
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Then you shout.

250
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
They will come in and save you.

251
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
What are you looking for me for?

252
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I should be asking you this.

253
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Last night, you stole my personal bag in my room.

254
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
And then framed me for the ghost incident.

255
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Young Master, why are you doing this?

256
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Why?

257
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,720
To get you out of Zhou Mansion as soon as possible.

258
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
If you leave now, you can still be safe.

259
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
So you admit it now.

260
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
The ghost incident has nothing to do with you.

261
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
You found the ghost.

262
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
You know it too.

263
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Are you going to shave my beard?

264
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Beard doesn't grow on the neck.

265
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
I'm afraid you don't know me well.

266
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Then let me know more.

267
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
I don't mind it.

268
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I...

269
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
I made up my mind to stay in Zhou Mansion.

270
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,720
If you let me go, I'll pull you to the back.

271
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,720
If you let me die, I'll let you die with me.

272
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,720
No one in this mansion is easy to deal with.

273
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
You can't beat them.

274
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Why should I fight with them?

275
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
I don't mind sharing with others.

276
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Men.

277
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,720
The wind blows the red dry leaves.

278
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,720
The coldness in my heart.

279
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,720
If the rose blooms in the cold.

280
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,720
How can I wait?

281
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,720
The wind blows the red dry leaves.

282
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
The coldness in my heart.

283
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,720
The wind blows the red dry leaves.

284
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,720
The coldness in my heart.

285
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,720
The wind blows the red dry leaves.

286
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,720
The coldness in my heart.

287
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,820
The coldness in my heart

288
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,620
I cry for time

289
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
at the end of teacher's lecture.

290
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I'm trapped.

291
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,720
I'll fight against the wind to throw everybody out of the city.
