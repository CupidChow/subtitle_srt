1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Love Me, ancient

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,080
The Fast and Furious

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,440
What's the matter with the maid?

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,160
Esured Drucker

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,960
Miss Ye

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,480
It's Third Aunt.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,600
She committed suicide last night.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,880
Suicide?

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,120
Master,

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,240
Third Aunt did so many bad things.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,040
You even worshiped her at the Hall of Miraculousness.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,760
I'm sure she knows it.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,640
I have no regrets.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,040
I wanted her to live a peaceful life.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,200
I didn't expect her to commit suicide.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,120
That day,

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
when I went to the cold garden to deliver things,

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
I didn't see her at all.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,160
I was so confused.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,640
She had a good place to go.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,280
Master,

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,080
why did Third Aunt commit suicide?

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,760
Why are you here?

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,520
Miss Ye,

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,440
we found this will

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,800
next to Third Aunt's body.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,400
The content is

28
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,920
Master and Young Master are both dead.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,960
She refused to go back to Liaoque.

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,560
So she went with them.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
I happen to be looking for you.

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,320
Master, I'm leaving.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,280
What's wrong?

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
You look worried.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,960
I received a letter

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,800
from Xu Hansheng at the door of Zhou Mansion.

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,920
Xu... Xu Hansheng?

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Isn't he dead?

39
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
He must have made an appointment

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
with Ji Xing in advance.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,040
The letter said

42
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,640
after he kissed my sister,

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
he was sure my sister wasn't dead.

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,080
He wrote a letter to tell you

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,880
that your sister was pushed into the lake by another person.

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,920
Is there a possibility?

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Someone wrote this letter

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
in the name of Ye Chu Xue

49
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,200
and asked your sister and the butler

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,600
to meet at the back garden at the same time.

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,840
He killed my sister

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,960
and buried her in the butler's grave.

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,320
The letter said

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
the invitation letter was kept well.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,160
But we've searched the room.

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
There's nothing there.

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
Let's go and check it out.

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,480
It's basically empty here.

59
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
There's no letter.

60
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
You found it.

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Jin Ping Mei?

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
You haven't read this book, have you?

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
I have.

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,960
I read it on the shelf.

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,280
You...

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
You're a woman who has read books.

67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
You read these books?

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,080
So what?

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm not a nun.

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,440
Only men read it.

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,600
Women can't read it.

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,600
Women should be curious, too.

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,200
You're right.

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,400
I, Qingmu, have been a butler for a long time.

75
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,440
I want to ask you out tonight.

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Qingmu?

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,600
Why would he like that animal?

78
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,520
When he was still alive,

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,960
he was always distant from the butler.

80
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,600
But why is this

81
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,080
the same as my sister's?

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,880
Three years ago, I did a test in the mansion.

83
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,840
It's a letter.

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
All the notes are here.

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,640
No one looks like Ye Chu Xue's handwriting.

86
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
This handwriting...

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

88
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
The will of San Yitai?

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's totally different.

90
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,960
The same person's handwriting

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,760
and the proportion of strokes

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
and the pattern of movement

93
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,760
are of a certain system.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
The character of San Yitai

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,400
is different from the character of my sister.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,240
It's not even in a clear sense.

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,080
The handwriting is not fast.

98
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,160
The strokes are unnatural.

99
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,400
The sound is reversed.

100
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,720
But the movement of the two words

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,080
is strictly followed by the standard of the Golden Body.

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,960
This shows that San Yitai's handwriting

103
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,640
was faked by the writer of my sister.

104
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,840
So San Yitai's will

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
is also faked?

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,320
It seems that my sister's death

107
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,800
was the same as San Yitai's death.

108
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,840
And it's in this mansion.

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,360
I'll ask you all to help me

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,920
with the rental of the shop.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,080
Miss Ye, are you looking for the owner?

113
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,080
No, I'm here to see you.

114
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
Are you busy?

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Me?

116
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm sorry, everyone.

117
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,720
This is an important guest.

118
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll excuse myself.

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,080
We're right.

120
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,480
You're really good at managing the household affairs.

121
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,520
Thank you for your trust,

122
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
and Miss Ye.

123
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
What can I do for you?

124
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,320
Do you have the internal magazine

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,680
written by San Yitai when he was in the family?

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,200
Well,

127
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,320
the owner asked me this early in the morning.

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,760
San Yitai didn't like to write before.

129
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,000
The internal magazine was written by the butler and me.

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,560
Why are you so anxious?

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay if you don't have it.

132
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,720
Miss Ye, I just remembered that

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,360
San Yitai liked to listen to opera

134
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,080
when he first got married.

135
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,360
He had copied some opera lines

136
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
and was punished by the master.

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,480
It seems to be in this account book.

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
Wait here, I'll look for it for you.

139
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,920
Okay.

140
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Here, Miss Ye.

141
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
Can you give me these?

142
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Of course.

143
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll leave you to your business.

144
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Aren't you going to wait for the master?

145
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,680
No.

146
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Be careful, Miss Ye.

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,480
Master.

148
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,560
Be careful.

149
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,040
Be careful, Master.

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
He drank too much today.

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
He vomited a lot.

152
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,280
You two,

153
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,800
wash the car with Jinbao.

154
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
I'll take care of the master.

155
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,560
Yes.

156
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:53,960
Okay.

157
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
Thank you for taking care of the master.

158
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,000
Miss Ye.

159
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,000
Be careful.

160
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,320
The lines and handwriting of San Yitai

161
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,080
are exactly the same as the one in the book.

162
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
Did I make a mistake?

163
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,000
Master.

164
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,440
Master.

165
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,800
Why didn't you close the door?

166
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,800
Look what I brought.

167
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,160
Zhiqiu.

168
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,280
Lan Xi, you...

169
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,200
Let me explain.

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
You explain.

171
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,080
I drank too much yesterday.

172
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
Jinbao drove me back.

173
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,040
Yes.

174
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,760
Jinbao drove me back.

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,760
He drove me to the door.

176
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,400
I...

177
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,240
I...

178
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,800
My head hurts.

179
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't remember.

180
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,880
I passed out.

181
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
You passed out?

182
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,280
Who changed your clothes?

183
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
Why did Lan Xi appear on your bed?

184
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,760
Miss Ye.

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,280
Don't misunderstand.

186
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,960
It's not your fault.

187
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,120
Who else?

188
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Me?

189
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,560
Me.

190
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,040
Master drank too much last night.

191
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,960
He recognized you for me.

192
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,240
I...

193
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,200
I didn't refuse.

194
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,840
Shut up.

195
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,680
Master.

196
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,680
So you know

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,200
he treated you like me.

198
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
You didn't refuse.

199
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,600
Lan Xi.

200
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,560
As a woman,

201
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
I wanted to live up to your reputation.

202
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,360
Now I'm worried.

203
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,440
Miss Ye.

204
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,960
Don't go.

205
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,040
I...

206
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll go.

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,560
If you leave,

208
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
you'll lose everything.

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,320
You'll sleep for nothing.

210
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,000
Master.

211
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,360
Please don't let me lose everything.

212
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,240
I followed you all the way

213
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
to fight for the country and protect our family.

214
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
I have no credit or credit.

215
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,480
Please don't let me lose everything.

216
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Master.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Let go.

218
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,320
Zhiqiu.

219
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't follow me.

220
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,960
So he didn't come these days?

221
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
Yes.

222
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,840
He took a few days off.

223
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,240
There's no one in the dorm.

224
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm going to call the police.

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
No need.

226
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
Maybe he's hiding from you on purpose.

227
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,760
Why don't you give each other some space

228
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,120
to change?

229
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,640
Dean.

230
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
The patients are waiting.

231
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,000
Boss Zhou.

232
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,280
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,320
Dean Lin.

234
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,760
I'm leaving.

235
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,200
If you see him

236
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,880
and tell him for me,

237
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,600
I'll wait for him to change his mind.

238
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,240
Okay.

239
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,200
You can come out now.

240
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
It's not good to hide from him all the time.

241
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Thank you, Dean Lin.

242
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,880
Here.

243
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,440
The flowers he gave you.

244
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,400
Thank you.

245
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Thank you.

247
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,440
Thank you.

248
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,040
Thank you.

249
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,560
Thank you.

250
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,120
Thank you.

251
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,760
Thank you.

252
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,360
Thank you.

253
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,960
Thank you.

254
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,560
Thank you.

255
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,160
Thank you.

256
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,760
Thank you.

257
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,520
Hu.

258
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,560
Right.

259
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
This is you.

260
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,360
Na Xi.

261
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
You were born to be a master.

262
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,600
The last chapter of the Third Yi Tai

263
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,040
is the same as the last chapter of the book.

264
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,080
Could it be...

265
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,320
Hello.

266
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,400
Mu Chong Lu, No.17.

267
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Master Li Zhai is in critical condition.

268
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
He needs immediate treatment.

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,880
I'll be there right now.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm a doctor in the Central Hospital.

271
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,040
He's in there. Please come in.

272
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,520
I guessed it right.

273
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,160
You're in the hospital.

274
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,400
Yes.

275
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
I'm here for the first checkup.

276
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,800
Since there are no patients here,

277
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't have to stay here.

278
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,920
Wait.

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
I'll take a look at you.

280
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,520
Just five minutes.

281
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,200
I just want to see you.

282
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,800
I won't force you.

283
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,640
I won't force you to do anything.

284
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,040
Look.

285
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,560
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm not as fragile as you think.

288
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,960
This is a small matter.

289
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,000
It won't hurt me.

290
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,080
You don't have to say sorry to me.

291
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,720
You...

292
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,880
How are you doing recently?

293
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm fine.

294
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,280
It's time.

295
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,760
Wait.

296
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,720
I'll wait for you

297
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,800
until you forgive me.

298
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,680
I'll tell you the truth.

299
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,200
I will.

300
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,540
You need Didi.

301
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,600
I'll live well.

302
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,720
You have orders.

303
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll be there.

304
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,640
No way.

305
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,040
Don't you know that from now on
