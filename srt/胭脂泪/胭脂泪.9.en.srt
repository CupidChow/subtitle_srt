1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Music

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Sound of thunder

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sound of wind

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sound of wind

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sound of wind

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Music

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why are you kneeling here?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Second Young Master, your mother asked me to be punished.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My mother? Why did she punish you?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She punished me for being unrighteous and shameless.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Second Young Master, please don't blame me.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is what I should have been punished for.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Please go back to your room. I will talk to my mother.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Please don't interfere with my business.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then you should take off your umbrella and don't get hurt.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Second Young Master, please pay attention to your status and identity.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't hurt me again.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Music

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Music

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mother.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Music

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm afraid the snow tonight won't stop for a while.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If Mother Wu is ill, if it spreads, I'm afraid it will be bad for your mother's reputation.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The matter tonight was the master's idea.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The dance room must be disciplined.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't interfere.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can you send someone to help her carry the umbrella?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In case she...

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Chen, you have crossed the line.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't care what you are thinking.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Just hide it well.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't let the blind see you.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You need to know where my umbrella is.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you understand?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you understand?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I understand.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't forget the suffering you suffered.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now you finally got it.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't want to lose anything.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No matter what the price is.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Go back to your room and rest tonight.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't come out without my permission.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Shanghai Tea Room.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Longjing 500 incense.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
30,000 silver yuan.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Tianjin Yingdu Street.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Longjing 1000 incense.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
60,000 silver yuan.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And...

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh no! The dock is flooded!

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The dock?

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you doing?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are so stupid.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Someone is here.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Get out of my way.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shangyao.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't want it.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are so fierce to me.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How can you turn into a little rabbit in front of San Yitai?

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I have my own purpose.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Do you want to be in charge?

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Your purpose?

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You want to get yourself sick?

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So you'd better not stop me.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I know you want to act.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But I don't have to act so seriously.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't worry.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The dock is flooded.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The people in the mansion are going to help.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
San Yitai has a southern west.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I ordered someone to put out the back light.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Get a straw stick and kneel down.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's snowing.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No one will find out.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The dock is flooded in the snow.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are so stupid.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So what?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Zhou Yimo.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are so self-righteous.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Aren't you?

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Look at your knees.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You think you are a iron wall?

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The snow is falling.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Xue Yi is really professional.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't bother about my business anymore.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It seems you still don't understand.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Understand what?

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Three years ago,

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you saved my life in the medical school.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I did this just to pay back

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the life-saving debt of that year.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know what you mean.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I just want to ask you

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
if you have any idea

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
what you mean.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why are you so surprised?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have recognized you long ago.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Go to the end of the world

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and find your true self.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't need to know about my secrets.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Memories will never stop.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You recognize me.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why don't you acknowledge me?

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I changed my name

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to change my identity.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why do you ask so much?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Even if you're a hero,

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,840
I saved you,

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,040
but it's of no use to me now.

114
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,480
You're a tough woman.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,160
Not everyone can live as you want.

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
You're a young man,

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,080
but you wear a mask at night,

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
eat and drink,

119
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,200
and act like a hero.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm not a hero.

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,440
It's all written by the newspaper for the sake of the eye.

122
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
It's not the whole story.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
So what's the whole story?

124
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,280
I'll tell you the first thing

125
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,400
when the time comes.

126
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,240
By the way,

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
I found a clue

128
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,040
that has something to do with your sister's death.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,480
I was thinking of finding out and telling you.

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
You rejected my help so much.

131
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Forget it.

132
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,800
Goodbye.

133
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,840
Goodbye.

134
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
Why are you pretending to be weak?

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Get up and talk to me.

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
Madam,

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,080
you dragged me.

138
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
Why did you blame me?

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,880
This clue is a big secret.

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
It's not good to be eavesdropped.

141
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,400
Is this distance

142
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
enough?

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,080
Madam,

144
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,920
do you have sexy clothes?

145
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
Do you?

146
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,920
Come on and tell me the truth.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Come on and tell me the truth.

148
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,160
Brother Parildo

149
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,500
Am I good looking?

150
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,080
Yes

151
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
He was right

152
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,200
What were you doing on Christmas Eve three years ago?

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,060
Three years ago? Who took me in?

154
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
No.

155
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Let her go.

156
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
I know.

157
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I know.

158
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
When that woman comes back,

159
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
she will definitely get revenge on us.

160
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
What woman?

161
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
That woman is Xi Zi An He.

162
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,880
She is now the heart of the Great God.

163
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
How could she let us go?

164
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Tell me clearly.

165
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Why did Xi Zi An He get revenge on you?

166
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
It was Young Master.

167
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Young Master asked us to go.

168
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Young Master asked us to show Xi Zi some colors.

169
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
What do you mean?

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Show her some colors.

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Show her colors to a woman.

172
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
What's the point?

173
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Where is Shen Ou Ye?

174
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Where is he?

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I'll leave him.

176
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I'll go.

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
You bastards.

178
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Bastards.

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Bastards.

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Don't hit me.

181
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't hit me.

182
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
This is probably the reason why Chu Xue and An He left Wu Xian.

183
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,880
I didn't expect that Zhao Yi Chen would do such a terrible thing.

184
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Your mother was deceived by her appearance.

185
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
She is usually like this.

186
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
What's going on in the alley?

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm here.

188
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Help.

189
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Help.

190
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Let's split up.

191
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
The East side is just out of the fire.

192
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
No one is there.

193
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I'll go to the West side to lure them away.

194
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Leave it to me.

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Old man.

196
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Be careful.

197
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Old man.

198
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Old man, are you here?

199
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Old man.

200
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Brother.

201
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
What's wrong, brother?

202
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
As your brother,

203
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
you came to care about the business of the family.

204
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
So that you won't say that I'm not good at martial arts at home.

205
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Do you think I won't believe what you said to me?

206
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Brother, the dock is crowded and complicated.

207
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
You came here alone.

208
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Don't let anything happen.

209
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
There's fire.

210
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
There's water.

211
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
As long as I follow,

212
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
the young master will not be in danger.

213
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Madam.

214
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
We are all family.

215
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
It's not good to shoot at each other like this.

216
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
We are just kidding.

217
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
You go back.

218
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Thank you, brother.

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
After work,

220
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
go home early to eat.

221
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
What's this?

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Go home after you change.

223
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
The clothes are all broken.

224
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
You change first.

225
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
I'll wait for you in the car.

226
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
No need.

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Just don't turn around.

228
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Okay.

229
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
But only you.

230
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
It's been a long time.

231
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
You can still find out the news.

232
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
As the young master of the Zhou family,

233
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
I have a way to get the news myself.

234
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
At this time,

235
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Zhou Yuchen will definitely take action.

236
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Brother Wang.

237
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
What's wrong?

238
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Look at those people.

239
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Are they people?

240
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Yes, they are our people.

241
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Go to the police station and report the case.

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Go, go.

243
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
You must help us.

244
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Uncle.

245
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
This matter,

246
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
don't worry.

247
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
A family does not speak two words.

248
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Come in, come in.

249
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Sir.

250
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
The dock sent five bodies of water.

251
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
There are seven dead bodies.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
I asked to pick up some people.

253
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
There should be clues at the dock.

254
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Shi Anna.

255
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
There are several accidents every day.

256
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,880
What can he say about the drowned?

257
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
But in the same place,

258
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
five people died at the same time.

259
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Isn't it a bit too coincidental?

260
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I don't think it's coincidental.

261
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Maybe they drank together yesterday.

262
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
They drank too much and then went to the river.

263
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Someone fell down.

264
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Someone has to save them.

265
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
One by one, one by one.

266
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
If they don't come up,

267
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
they will be drowned.

268
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Right?

269
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Sir.

270
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Now the world is not peaceful.

271
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
It's time for us to be fair.

272
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Take this money

273
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
and comfort those five families.

274
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Don't make trouble in the police station.

275
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
It's going to be a headache.

276
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Go, go.

277
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Sir.

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
This is an order,

279
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
not a discussion.

280
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
If you can't do it,

281
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
don't come tomorrow.

282
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Mr. Yu.

283
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
My surname is Zhou.

284
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
What can I do for you?

285
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

286
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
What favor?

287
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Five workers died at the docks of my Zhou family.

288
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
It's a case.

289
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
It's an accident.

290
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
My family is far away from home.

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
As long as the place where the water is靠水 is an accident,

292
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
you should have a lot of clues.

293
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Mr. Zhou,

294
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
you are the owner of the Zhou family.

295
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
If you have any clues,

296
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
you can go back and check.
