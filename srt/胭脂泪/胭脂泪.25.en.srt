00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now that things have come to this,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
don't you have anything to say to me?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I deliberately hid you from Nanxi's pregnancy.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I used you and hurt you.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I thought we had enough trust.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You would treat me like your own person.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You would tell me the truth in secret.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me cooperate with you.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But you didn't.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You played me so badly.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because I knew that Nanxi must have bought the person by your side.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But I can't be sure who betrayed you and betrayed you.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So I can only choose to fight alone.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think I'll explain it to you slowly after everything is over.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you so sure that after all these things are over,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
will you explain to me and I will forgive you?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You'd rather see me down, see me sad,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
see me being framed by the people around me.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't care about it.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm so worthless to you.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't misunderstand. That's not what I mean.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then what do you mean?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can be angry.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You can also punish me.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As long as you can feel better.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Punish me?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Punish me.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Zhou Yingluo, what's wrong with you?

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I told you when I first came to the Zhou Mansion.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm willing to be used by you and be your pawn.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Please believe me.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is only a joke.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I don't blame you.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm happy.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Everyone is wrong.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I'm running into something in between.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is it?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wait, I don't think this is good.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Publicmaticти

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Don't point out my secret

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm a man of courage

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
I can't lie to you

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,400
The heart that loves you is always hidden

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,000
You are everywhere in the galaxy

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's because of you

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,200
I'm alone again and again

51
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,400
But I'm still addicted

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm addicted and I'm happy

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,400
You don't need to point out my secret

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm a man of courage

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
You're finally here

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Director Zhou

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,600
I didn't expect

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,400
The whole Zhou family was played by a little girl like you

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
In your hands

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Actually, I want to play bigger

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I don't know if Director Zhou can help me

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
But is it because of what you have in your hands

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
So-called evidence about me

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Aren't you afraid that I'm here to silence you

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Director Zhou wouldn't think

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
The evidence that you and Mr. Zhou have been selling opium for years

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,800
I only have one in my hand

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Where is the rest of the evidence

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I told you

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I can live tonight

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Director Zhou also thinks that I am too simple

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
What do you want

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I made a deal with the people outside

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Once I die

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
All your criminal evidence will be public

76
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Director Zhou has power, power, power, family

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Once I die

78
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
People outside will have nothing to worry about

79
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Protect me is protecting you

80
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Director Zhou

81
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
You choose yourself

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Sorry sister-in-law

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I don't want to see you

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I also want to live a good life

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Don't come to me

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Look for Director Zhou

87
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Mr. Zhou

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
This is the police

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
This is the police station

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
You are blocking public affairs

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
You are afraid of yourself

92
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
What are you burning

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Unrevealable

94
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I support you

95
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
You run to the south

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
What are you doing

97
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
With my identity

98
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
He dare not touch me

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Ye Zhiqiu

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
You have to know why you have come to this day

101
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Be sure to keep the evidence

102
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
go

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Mr. Zhou

104
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Where are you going so late

105
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Uncle

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
What crime did I commit

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
Everyone is pointing at me with a gun

108
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Leave things

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
What you want is in my hand

110
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Put down the gun

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Put down

112
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Ye Zhiqiu

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
What benefits does he have for us

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Zhou Jian

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
You even don't want your uncle's life for him

116
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Uncle

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
I am a He family

118
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Four years, Miss Ye

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Why are you the same

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Yes

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Four years

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Four years ago

123
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
You burned my sister's autopsy report

124
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Let her die in the cold

125
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Now the truth is about to come back to the right

126
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
This is not what you are doing now

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
I just want to make a fortune

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
What does this have to do with me

129
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I can give you whatever you want

130
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
You used to be my subordinate

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
So ungrateful

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Miss Ye

133
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Can you bully

134
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
No, no, brother

135
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Brother, listen to me

136
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I am not a good person

137
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I am not a good person

138
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I am not a good person

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
No, no, brother

140
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Brother, listen to me

141
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Zhou Quan threatened me with my whole family's life

142
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
I had no choice

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
You still remember me

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Very good

145
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Since we are brothers

146
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
The safety of brothers and family

147
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Leave it to me

148
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Remember

149
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
From now on, Miss Ye's business is my business

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Understand

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Understand

152
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Understand

153
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Go in

154
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Miss Ye

155
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
You are really brave

156
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
You can even enter and exit the police station at will

157
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
It seems that I am useless here today

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Useful

159
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Can you help me

160
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
What to help you

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Can you

162
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Go in

163
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Help me save Zhou Yi Mo

164
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
You want me to go in and save him

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Why

166
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Xiaoman

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Do you think

168
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
I can be easily caught by you

169
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I am not kidding with you

170
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Xiaoman

171
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I came today

172
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
It was Zhou Yi Mo who asked me to pick you up

173
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Do not worry

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
He will not be hurt

175
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
You have already discussed about joining hands together

176
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Join hands

177
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Why should I join hands with him

178
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I am because of your safety

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I forced to agree

180
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Let's go

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
You must save him

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Xiaoman

183
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
This is all

184
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
He has arranged it

185
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
And there are people outside the police station

186
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
And there are people who are mine

187
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You can rest assured

188
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
The most important thing now

189
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Is to keep the evidence in your hands

190
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Xiaoman

191
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Everything I did

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
It's all for you

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Why are you still at his house

194
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I am afraid

195
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
You go

196
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Why are you afraid of me

197
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Or are you afraid that I will steal your evidence

198
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Xiaoman

199
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Officer Yu

200
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Thank you so much

201
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
I still hope that in the future

202
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I can hear you calling me Ange

203
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
It's a life-saving grace

204
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Right

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
There must be some returns

206
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Right

207
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Okay

208
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Shi Ange

209
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Shi Ange

210
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Shi Ange

211
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Shi Ange

212
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
When you arrive at the place

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Remember to check the evidence

214
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
If you are seriously burned

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The other party may deny that it was written by him

216
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I am back

217
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
How are you

218
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I am fine

219
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Silly

220
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Didn't I say

221
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
There are people in the police station

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
And there are troops controlled by Yu Shi An

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
What can Zhou Qiuan do to me

224
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
But Yu Shi An

225
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
He didn't make it difficult for you, right

226
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
He promised to help you

227
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Of course he won't make it difficult for me

228
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
If you are not sure

229
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
I won't let him go

230
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
I will help you

231
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
It's good that Ping An is back

232
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Where is the evidence

233
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
The evidence was destroyed and can't be seen clearly

234
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Your honor

235
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
My client

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Miss Ye Zhiqiu

237
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
A year of secret investigation

238
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Restored the whole process of Ye Chu Xue's death three years ago

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
That night

240
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Xu Hansheng of the steward

241
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Received a letter from Ye Chu Xue

242
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Invite him to the back yard of the pond

243
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
And date with himself

244
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
But according to the various evidence

245
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
At this time, Ye Chu Xue

246
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Just escaped from the private residence of the second young master of Zhou's mansion

247
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
All injured

248
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
And already full of scars

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
This is the same as Zhou Yichen

250
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
And the confession of Xu Hansheng before he died

251
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
And his own autopsy report

252
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Match

253
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Xu Xue

254
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
The steward asked you to go to the back yard

255
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I

256
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I have fallen asleep

257
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I'm not feeling well. Can I go tomorrow?

258
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
No

259
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
The steward looks very angry

260
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
How about this

261
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I'll go with you, okay?

262
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
No

263
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I'll go by myself

264
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
No

265
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
I can't go

266
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
I can't go

267
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I can't go

268
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I can't go

269
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I can't go

270
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
I can't go

271
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I can't go

272
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I can't go

273
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll go by myself

274
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
You don't have to accompany me

275
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Nanxie

276
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
I'm here

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
