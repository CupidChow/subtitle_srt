00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Music

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sound of a thunder

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sound of a thunder

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sound of birds chirping

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sound of water

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sound of birds chirping

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sound of water

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sound of footsteps

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Music

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Music

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Music

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Liu Wei, I've seen so many brides before.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,880
You're the most beautiful one.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,920
When the groom comes,

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,360
you'll be in trouble.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,960
How long until the auspicious time?

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,480
It's not the auspicious time yet.

25
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,760
Why are you still waiting?

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,600
Miss Ye, please wait a moment.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
Don't move.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
You won't just let Zhou Yimo

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,000
take care of her.

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,160
You're really taking revenge.

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,840
Where's Yan Zhichiu?

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,600
His bride was taken away by you.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,160
Send her to the hospital.

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,040
Yushan?

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
Zhichiu was taken away by Lu Huaiwu?

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,800
I know.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
But you're all under the watch.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,840
This is a good plan.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,600
I can't live without Xiao Man with you.

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
Ruanfang.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
Zhou Yimo seems to be looking for the commander-in-chief.

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
We have to hide in there.

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,920
Don't come out.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,240
Otherwise,

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,440
we can drink Brother Yu's wedding wine.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
It's Yushan.

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,480
Ouch!

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,320
Get lost.

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,440
Zhou Yimo.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,080
Don't let anything happen to her.

52
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,480
Go.

53
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
Get out of the way.

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
Zhou Yimo.

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
Where are you?

56
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,000
Put down your guns.

57
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,480
Go.

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,400
Xiao Man.

59
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
Zhou Yimo...

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,920
Xiao Man.

61
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,640
This is Commander-in-Chief Lu.

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
He was killed by Zhou Yimo.

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,920
He was taken away by the guards.

64
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,400
But don't worry.

65
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,840
I'll help you.

66
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,400
You kidnapped me on your wedding day.

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,960
You gave the fire to Commander-in-Chief Lu.

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,800
You made Zhou Yimo come to you and kill you.

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,600
You used the other man's hand to kill Commander-in-Chief Lu.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Yushan.

71
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,480
You played a big game.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
You killed Commander-in-Chief Lu, right?

73
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,400
Xiao Man.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,920
You're still as smart as before.

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
Where's Ye Zhiqiu?

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Zhou Yimo.

77
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,800
How dare you

78
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,280
come to my mansion to play dirty?

79
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm asking you, where's Ye Zhiqiu?

80
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
Who's Ye Zhiqiu?

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,560
Zhou Yimo.

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,560
How dare you

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,160
not only steal the ducks,

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,920
but also kill Commander-in-Chief Lu?

85
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,280
Take him away.

86
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,040
Commander-in-Chief Lu.

87
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,360
I'll help you in the future.

88
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,040
Commander-in-Chief Lu.

89
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,440
We'll be at your service.

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,200
Commander-in-Chief Lu.

91
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Commander-in-Chief Lu.

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,800
Yushan.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,680
Yushan.

94
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Why did you become like this?

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,960
I was like this.

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,880
I don't want to pretend anymore.

97
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,920
Since you won't like me no matter what,

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,600
I'll just be myself.

99
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
Take her away.

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,160
Go.

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,560
Yushan.

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Go.

103
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I know you only love Zhou Yimo.

104
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,280
But it's okay.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
As long as you marry me,

106
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll let her go.

107
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Really.

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,960
As long as you stay by my side,

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
I'll listen to you.

110
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
I promise you.

111
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Before that,

112
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
I want to see Zhou Yimo.

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,640
My dear Xiaoman.

114
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
My dear Xiaoman.

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,000
What are you playing with me again?

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
What else can I play?

117
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
I'm going to marry you.

118
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
Of course I have to tell her

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,560
some heartless words.

120
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Shyan.

121
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,440
Your police station is heavily guarded.

122
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm under your strict supervision.

123
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,800
What else can I do?

124
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,400
Shyan.

125
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,680
It's always been like this since I was a kid.

126
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,040
As long as you call me Shyan,

127
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
my heart will melt.

128
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
I can give you

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,000
whatever you want.

130
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,960
But don't let me down.

131
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Dongmao.

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,840
Because if you let me down,

133
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
I'll tie Zhou Yimo up

134
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,440
and let her watch us play the night of flowers.

135
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,880
Then I'll tie a bomb to her

136
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,200
so that she can die without any power.

137
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,280
I'll break her bones.

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
This is your favorite fried rice when you were a kid.

139
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
I haven't eaten for days.

140
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
You must be hungry.

141
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
Come on, let me feed you.

142
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Here.

143
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,440
The moon is bright and bright

144
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Have another bite.

145
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,520
The moon is looking at the blue sky

146
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,640
The earth is spinning

147
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,720
You are spinning too

148
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,560
The sun is shining

149
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

150
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,760
The stars are rising

151
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,920
You are coming out soon

152
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,120
You are thirsty, right?

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,160
I can't get you out of my dream

154
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,160
You see the sunset

155
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,400
She is asleep

156
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Waiting for the sun to rise tomorrow

157
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Drink more.

158
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Dongmao.

159
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Chunqiu.

160
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Let go.

161
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
My lady.

162
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
You go out first.

163
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Am I not good at talking?

164
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
No, no.

165
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Aunt let me watch.

166
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Let me protect you.

167
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
I will speak nicely to you in front of her in the future.

168
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Good, good, good.

169
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
I won't disturb you.

170
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
I won't disturb you.

171
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
She called you lady.

172
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
I

173
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
I

174
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
I promised to marry Yu Shi'an.

175
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
For your freedom.

176
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Chunqiu.

177
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
I don't want you to marry him.

178
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Without you

179
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I can't live.

180
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
I beg you.

181
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
No.

182
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
No.

183
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I beg you.

184
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
No.

185
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
No.

186
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I beg you.

187
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Zhou Yingluo.

188
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
You have to remember.

189
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
If you die

190
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I will not live alone.

191
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
You have to be good.

192
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
No.

193
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
No.

194
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
No.
