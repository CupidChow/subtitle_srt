00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
What happened?

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
Why did it change so suddenly?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm tired.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I don't want to steal it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,600
But I can't get it.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,400
How is that possible?

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,600
Last night, I ran around the house of all the elders for you.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
I looked after you.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Did Zhou Yi Mo threaten you?

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
If so, I'll teach him a lesson.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Zhou Quan, I really don't want to fight anymore.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Don't force me, okay?

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
I don't want to.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
You don't want to? You have a family.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,800
I'm your cousin's wife.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,600
Our relationship will never be seen.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
So, forgive me for having a child.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,000
I thought about it more.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
But I don't want to.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
If you don't want to, come to the city to see us.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
I'll make you the best tea.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Zhou family's business is very tight.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,600
If you want to return to the He family completely,

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,400
I still need a few more days.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,600
It seems that Young Master is determined

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,600
to change this Zhou family into He family.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
The ceremony is about to start. What are you doing?

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,000
What did you call me?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,600
Young Master.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Zhou Yi Mo, what are you doing?

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Still not changing your mouth?

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Hold it.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
I promised you.

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,200
The first thing to become the head of the family is to restore your freedom.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't leave yet.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,400
I have to stay in Zhou family and investigate the real murderer.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Restoring freedom can also investigate the real murderer.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,600
I've had enough of the days of calling you aunt every day.

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
That won't do. I don't have an identity anymore.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
What's the point of staying in Zhou family?

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
I'll marry you.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Be my head of the family, okay?

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
Zhou Yi Mo, marriage is a big thing.

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
You can't be a fool.

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Moreover, it's a turbulent time.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
With your identity, you should find someone

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,400
who can help you in the business and win with you.

51
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm a person who's living for revenge.

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
It's definitely not two people.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
You woman.

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
You're still so confused about the reason for the change.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
You clearly know that I must be you.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,200
Master, the elders are waiting for you.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't waste time.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll wait for you.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Wait for your revenge to succeed.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I ask the new head of the Zhou family, Zhou Yi Mo,

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
to accompany all of your family members

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,600
to offer incense to ancestors.

63
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
First bow.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,600
Second bow.

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,200
All the people of the bloodline have been expelled.

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Only the eye of the rouge tears is left.

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Who is the rouge tears in my hand?

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Wuyi Tai, why are you here?

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Fourth bow.

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Nanxin, you told me before

71
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,400
that the rouge tears are the precious rouge of Second Yi Tai.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
But that day, I clearly saw that

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Fourth Yi Tai was also asking for help from the steward.

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,000
When Second Yi Tai was here, he was very strict.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
The rouge tears must be made for him alone.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,600
What's so good about the rouge tears?

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
I heard that there is a secret recipe

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,200
that can keep the rouge tears fresh for a long time.

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,800
It doesn't stain the cup and doesn't change the color.

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
It's very magical.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
Then can I also get the rouge tears?

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,600
Only the steward can contact the rouge tears.

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
The steward is a fourth Yi Tai person.

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,600
So the steward will definitely think of a way to help him arrange the production.

85
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,800
But you are the one who is difficult.

86
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Only the steward can contact them.

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,400
This is a special rouge tear specially made for you.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Third Yi Tai

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Only three boxes.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Can't you make more?

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
Miss Lin, you know it.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,800
The production process of rouge tears is quite complicated.

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
The second house and the master are dead.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you still worried about?

95
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,400
I don't even have this special privilege here.

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Help me get more.

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Okay. I'll go prepare now.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The second house and the master are dead.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The third house and the master are dead.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The fourth house and the master are dead.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The fifth house and the master are dead.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The sixth house and the master are dead.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The seventh house and the master are dead.

113
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

114
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

116
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

117
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

121
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

122
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

124
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
The seventh house and the master are dead.

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Wu Yitai, when did you come?

128
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Manager Xu.

129
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
What did you see?

130
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,600
You followed me because you wanted the Yanzhi Tear, didn't you?

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Fine. I'll tell you.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The Yanzhi Tear needs a special material.

133
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
It's the blood of a young girl.

134
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Wu Yitai, I know

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
that Master never touched you.

136
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,600
So now, you still have the right to be my material.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wu Yitai.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,800
All the inspirations of making the Yanzhi Tear

139
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
came from this.

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,200
As expected, the fairy of the young girl

141
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
She is so sweet.

142
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,240
Where is she?

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Did you find her?

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,640
I asked them.

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,000
Wu Yitai didn't go out at night.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,120
Master.

147
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
She is missing in the mansion.

148
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,120
Could she be a ghost?

149
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,680
Go and check.

150
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
No one is missing in the mansion.

151
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
We should move everyone to find Ye Zhiqiu.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
We can't let anyone escape.

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,560
Yes.

154
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
I'll check the house.

155
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,200
Go.

156
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,680
Wu Yitai.

157
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,080
Look.

158
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920
This is your Yanzhi Tear.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
But I'm afraid

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
you can't use it.

161
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Steward Xu.

162
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,440
I have no grudge with you.

163
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Just because I know

164
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,400
you made the Yanzhi Tear,

165
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
you want to kill me.

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,800
No grudge?

167
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,480
If you hadn't made the trouble,

168
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Miss Lin wouldn't have quit the competition.

169
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Steward Xu.

170
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
You've worked so hard for half your life.

171
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
It must be enough for so many men

172
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,160
to be your father.

173
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
Wu Yitai.

174
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,680
I don't understand what you mean.

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
You're the one who

176
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
left Miss Lin, right?

177
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm not lying to you.

178
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,600
When Master died,

179
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,880
I found your hidden secret.

180
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,240
I didn't tell you the truth

181
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,880
just to give you

182
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
the last respect.

183
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,280
Wu Yitai.

184
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
You're smart.

185
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,040
But you're a smart rebel and a smart man.

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,680
Do you know that?

187
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,520
Yanzhi Tear needs a special ingredient.

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
It's the blood of a young girl.

189
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,680
So much blood.

190
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
All of these

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,880
are made of the blood of a girl.

192
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,800
How's it?

193
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
Done.

194
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,120
Sis.

195
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,280
What did you do to her?

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,240
Three years ago, you sent Siyu Tai back to the city

197
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,960
and then went back to the mansion.

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,680
No one thinks that your whereabouts are suspicious.

199
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,920
But you know it yourself.

200
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,440
What did you do?

201
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I don't know.

202
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
You don't know?

203
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
I don't know.

204
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't know.

205
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
You don't know?

206
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I don't know.

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I don't know.

208
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
You don't know?

209
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
You don't know?

210
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Stop!

211
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Tell me.

212
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,960
What did you do to her?

213
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Tell me!

214
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,640
Stop, Ye Zhenqiu!

215
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Don't tell me!

216
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll tell you.

217
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Three years ago,

218
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,840
Chu Xue wrote me to meet her in the backyard.

219
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
At first,

220
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,240
I really didn't want to help her.

221
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I didn't want to hurt her.

222
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,440
Why did you call me here so late at night?

223
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Help me.

224
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Chu Xue,

225
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
what's wrong with you?

226
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
You...

227
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,840
Please help me.

228
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Chu Xue,

229
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
you're bleeding a lot.

230
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
So,

231
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
you're the one who left Yan Zhi Lei.

232
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
You're the one

233
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
who invaded him.

234
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Yes.

235
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
I did.

236
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
You did.

237
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
You did.

238
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
You did.

239
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
You did.

240
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
You did.

241
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
You did.

242
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
You did.

243
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I did everything.

244
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,240
But he asked me to do it.

245
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
If he didn't seduce me,

246
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,240
I wouldn't touch him.

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
You're lying!

248
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,840
He's not that kind of person.

249
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Xu Ansheng,

250
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Yilan,

251
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,640
your secret has been exposed.

252
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,640
I can't hide your identity anymore.

254
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm going to strangle you to death.

255
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,640
The faster you use your power,

256
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,640
I'll poison you.

257
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,440
I've made such a big mistake.

258
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
It's too late.

259
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
You're awake.

260
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,040
How long did I sleep?

261
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Three days.

262
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Where's the butler?

263
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Where's the other person?

264
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,640
He's still in the mansion.

265
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Why didn't you send him to the police station?

266
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,240
There's no solid evidence to convict him.

267
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Then...

268
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,640
Then those cigarettes...

269
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
Those cigarettes were all written by a young girl.

270
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Each bottle has a name.

271
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,040
There must be other victims.

272
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
But these girls didn't die.

273
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
The butler said

274
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,840
they were just given a name

275
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,240
because they were ordered.

276
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,640
Whether it's a name or a name,

277
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,440
we'll know when we ask.

278
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
I asked someone to do some research.

279
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,640
Look.

280
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,640
Xu Hansheng's original name is Xu Jiaxuan.

281
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,240
He worked at the rouge workshop of the Siyin Niangniang family.

282
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Fifteen years ago,

283
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,440
he was a female teacher.

284
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,640
Later, he was reported by his parents

285
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
for sending a female student.

286
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,840
He resigned.

287
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,240
But he couldn't be convicted because there was no evidence.

288
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,040
Except for the first-year students,

289
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
the people marked on the rouge

290
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,040
graduated from that female school.

291
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,040
If I'm not mistaken,

292
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,040
they were all female students who were sent to the right school.

293
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,040
The blood of these girls

294
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
was probably taken by them

295
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,640
when they were not willing to be sent to the right school.

296
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,440
Where are you going?

297
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm going to find these girls.

298
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
If they were sent to the right school,

299
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,840
they would definitely...

300
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
At this time,

301
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,240
we can't mess up the situation.

302
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Zhou Yingmeng.

303
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,640
Help me.

304
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,440
Help me find the best lawyer in the city.

305
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,440
What for?

306
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
This time,

307
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,640
I can't let him escape.

308
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,640
Okay.

309
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,840
Wuyi is really a tough girl.

310
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Why do you have to catch me?

311
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,840
Since Master is dead,

312
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,440
this secret is not important.

313
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm Ye Chu Xue's sister.

314
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
What?

315
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,640
You should pay for everything you did.

316
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,840
I didn't kill her.

317
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,040
Besides,

318
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,440
you have no evidence to prove that I have violated her.

319
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,240
But there must be someone

320
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,840
willing to stand up and accuse you of your crimes.

321
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,440
Wuyi is talking about

322
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,240
the people marked on the rouge?

323
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Yes.

324
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,040
I used their blood

325
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,440
to make the most expensive rouge.

326
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
And I left the most precious memories

327
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
of their teenage days

328
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
to let them experience the happiness of love.

329
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,240
They should thank me, right?

330
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Now,

331
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,440
they are married and pregnant.

332
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,640
They can't bear the criticism

333
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,040
they made after standing up to accuse me.

334
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
Wuyi,

335
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,040
to tell you the truth,

336
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,840
you can't sue me.

337
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Xu Hansheng,

338
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,440
let's wait and see.

339
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,240
Okay.

340
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll wait for you.

341
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,640
Why did I get hurt by waiting?

342
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,840
The moonlight soothes the dark night's love.

343
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,040
The dark night is shadowed by moonlight.

344
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,640
The ruby with the color of the moon is so bright.

345
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,240
The blood-colored love is hidden in the mirror.

346
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Words he wrote on the Hurupbeat будущą Pokar drink

347
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,440
pours down tears like two以 aussi wysiach annat.

348
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,280
The
