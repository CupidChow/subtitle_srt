00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I said there was half a lie.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This heart can be taken away at any time.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tell me, what secrets does Chu Xue have?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No secrets.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When will you give me a blind date?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
These girls look good.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I like them all.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How about you accompany me to see them?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Help me choose some.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm leaving.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wait.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This dress is very pretty.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It suits you.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
An He

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why did An He want to break up with you?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And he wanted to meet you at the peak of his career.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What happened in the middle?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you have any trouble,

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you can find me anytime.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
An He

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's me.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I know.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want you to help me confess.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The special line that Shi An Ge has set up is really working.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Who is it?

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You two, help me check something.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it working?

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He Mo Shuang

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Shi An Ge

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Get in the car.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No need.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The bus is all gone at night.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you don't want to be disturbed by the military,

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
get in the car.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Shi An Ge

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Shi An Ge

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Zhao Yi Mo

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm your aunt.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You have me in your heart.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't you?

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wu Luan

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wu Luan

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Master, what's wrong with you?

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why is your blood black?

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Did the fortune teller poison you?

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Master, let's go to the hospital to see a doctor.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's okay.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The fortune teller said

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
it's a ploy.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You don't need to see a doctor.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
By the way,

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wu Luan

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where are Wu and Yi Mo?

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This...

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Say it.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Master

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I just received a call from a anonymous person.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They said they saw the eldest son and Wu Yi Tai

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
listening to the play in the teahouse.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And they behaved like

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
they were close friends.

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Could it be

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
that it's not a dream?

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Master, what are you doing with the gun?

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Damn it.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Father

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Master

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you waiting for me?

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What do you think?

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why are you back together?

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Master

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Tonight is the first time

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Cuihua House has returned safe and sound.

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Young Master and I

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
met in the teahouse.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But fortunately, we met the eldest son.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The yellow bag car

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
didn't ring at all.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Aunt, next time

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll ask the steward

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
to arrange it well.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's convenient to bring the driver.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's a coincidence.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Otherwise, it will be troublesome.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're right.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Since you're back,

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
let's have dinner together.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm still young.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm really young.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Learn from your third sister.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She's the most comfortable.

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you, Master.

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Young Master is back.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Where did you go?

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Father

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go to my room tonight.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Father, something happened

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
at the dock today.

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I need you to deal with it.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm afraid I'll have to delay your time tonight.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your aunt will be with me tonight.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm not in the mood to talk about work.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's an important matter.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The business at home is to trust you.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you have any bad news,

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
please ask me.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll find someone to help you.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Father,

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't mind helping my brother.

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Please calm down.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm just too serious.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're a child.

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Just do it yourself.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't ask your father for anything.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't worry about things you shouldn't worry about.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Father,

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
try this Yang Bian wine.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's very effective.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're too heavy.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm not.

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's too heavy.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This taste...

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Since you're a good filial son, I'll drink it.

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're really a good sister.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Xiao Wu,

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you're a good drinker.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll drink with you tonight.

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay.

137
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why aren't you drinking?

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I just

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
drank for you.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm a little dizzy now.

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You drink too.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Good.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Good.

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Who is it?

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I told you not to bother me tonight.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What's wrong?

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Help me.

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Help you?

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I drank some secret medicine for Master.

152
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I drank it myself.

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What is a secret medicine?

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a kind of

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
spiritual spring medicine

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that makes people hallucinate.

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It can make them feel

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
like they're in a couple with me.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So you didn't have an accident?

160
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Of course not.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How can I help you?

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Master's effect is getting worse.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
My effect is getting worse too.

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm afraid that the people in the mansion

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
will see you.

166
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So I want you...

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I want you to see me.

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You want me to see you

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and you're not afraid that I'll take advantage of you?

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't joke.

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Zhu Yimeng,

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I believe you.

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Later,

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
no matter what I say

175
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
or do,

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you must not believe

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that this is an illusion

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and not the truth.

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I will never believe that.

180
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I will never believe that.

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I will never believe that.

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will never believe that.

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Master,

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't know that

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you're not afraid that I'll kill you.

186
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Young Master.

187
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Young Master.

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Young Master.
