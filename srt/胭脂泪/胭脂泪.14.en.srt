00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,800
Since you've seen through it,

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,600
why did you hide it for her?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,400
It seems that Madam said something

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,600
that I don't quite understand.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
All these years,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,800
she pushed you forward.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,200
It seems that you're trying to

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
cultivate the Zhou family's master.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,400
But in fact,

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,000
you can help her

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
when something goes wrong.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,600
So what?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
You may never know.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,400
It's my happiness

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,400
to be used by my father.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Madam.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
The clothes you're wearing today

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
are so beautiful.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
You chose it?

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Madam.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
We

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,200
will meet again in the afterlife.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The moon is in the dream

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The earth is spinning

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are spinning too

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The sun is shining

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Star, come out quickly

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Chase, chase, chase

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't come into my dream

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Look at the sunset

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She's asleep

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Waiting for tomorrow

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
To smile at the sun

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She didn't sell the master

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
in the end.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I said that the tea from the Zhou family

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
was wrong these two years.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I didn't expect that they were selling

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the yin cakes that hurt people.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I didn't expect that.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Fellow villagers,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
this place

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
seems to be a restaurant.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But it's actually

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
a warehouse where Zhou Yi Chen

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
sells yin cakes.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Zhou Yi Chen has regretted

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
his conscience before he died

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and took out all the yin cakes.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My father is in bad health.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm the one who's destroying it.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's good that the young master

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
of the Zhou family is on the right track.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So you knew

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
that the master and Zhou Yi Chen

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
were selling yin cakes

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
with the signs of buying and selling tea.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No wonder Yan Yan

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
can always find the yin cakes

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and destroy them quickly

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
without any hesitation.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The so-called hero

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
is just a mole.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can't deny the hero

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
because his father is a bad person.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You really gave me a good chance.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As long as I don't hurt anyone

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and don't do anything bad,

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
what's the use of using some tricks?

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How could this happen?

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yi Chen

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why did he

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
tell us everything?

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I heard

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that many of the bosses

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
who have signed

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the order for next year

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
have been taken to the He family.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's said that the He family

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
has given a lower price.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Is there a mysterious

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
head of the He family?

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've heard of it.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I've never seen it in the He family.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've never heard of it from my grandma.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's that He again.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The court has been investigating

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the case of the He family.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Master He

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Have you found out his background?

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Not yet.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I just heard

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that he invested in several banks

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and acquired the largest

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
textile and medicine industry in Wu County.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's said that

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Master He is older than you.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He has a private maid

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
who hasn't been found yet.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Private maid?

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Even if you find a woman,

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
how much trouble can she cause?

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She only has a sister.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Master He is right.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Have you taken the medicine on time?

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Isn't that Sa Yi Tai?

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go and save him.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll wait here.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Go.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Save him.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Sa Yi Tai.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sa Yi Tai.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sa Yi Tai.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's up, butler?

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Young Master.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Master wants to have dinner with you tonight.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He asked the kitchen to make

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
some dishes you like.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Thank you, butler.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's go.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Where can I go?

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Aren't you the new maid

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in Aunt Wu's room?

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why are you so nervous?

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I saw Aunt Wu

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
entering the hall just now.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hall?

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was dark inside.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The light was off.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I heard Aunt Wu

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
crying for half an hour.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She seemed to be possessed.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Young Master, I'm afraid there's a trap.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Master is waiting for you to have dinner.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't be too late.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Are you sure?

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Absolutely.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Young Master,

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
should we tell Master?

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Tell my father

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that I have a call meeting

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and I'll meet him later.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No one can tell him about this.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm warning you.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If anything goes wrong,

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm afraid you'll be dead.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I understand.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Aunt.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Aunt.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Aunt.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll take you away.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Old Cheng.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll take you away.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Old Cheng, let's go.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What...

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The secret box.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The secret box.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Fei Yue.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where's Master?

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Isn't he having dinner with Young Master?

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
San Yi Tai

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
took Master to the yard for a walk.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He said the plum blossoms in the pond have bloomed.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Pond?

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The secret box.

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The secret box.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Zhang Yi Meng.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wake up.

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Wake up.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Zhang Yi Meng.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Wake up.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The secret box.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I really want to be with you.

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Master has been much better lately.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I didn't expect Chen Er

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
to go in there earlier than me.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Er Qing.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yi Meng.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
God.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You...

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What the hell are you doing?

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My god.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You did such a bad thing.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Master.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's not what you think.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Guards.

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Lock this woman

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
in the cold house.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She'll be strangled to death tomorrow.

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
God.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not what you think.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I hate the person who betrayed me the most.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll shoot you.

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Master.

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't be rash.

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Second Young Master just died.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This family can't stand it anymore.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Master.

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll give you three chances.

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you can't explain it clearly,

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
just die with that woman.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I just came back today.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I heard that Lian Er said that

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
something happened to Wu Yi Niang.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
When I arrived at the ancestral hall,

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
she was lying on the ground

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
with her clothes on.

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was also struck by the incense.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
God, you came.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where is Lian Er?

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
She's waiting for you.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Bring her in.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Master.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Isn't it too scary?

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Tell me.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What happened?

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Master.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What did you tell Lian Er?

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Young Master said

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you told her

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that she went there

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
because something happened to her in the ancestral hall.

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is that true?

236
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No.

237
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Lian Er has never seen Young Master today.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Bullshit.

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You told me that.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
My wife, Zhang Jin Bao, was also there.

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But everyone in the mansion

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
knows that

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Zhang Jin Bao is Young Master's man.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He will help Young Master to get back on his feet.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Who told you to say that?

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why did Third Madam protect her like that?

247
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
How could I protect a little girl?

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Young Master,

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
when you came back today,

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the butler told you

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that he would have dinner with Master tonight.

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But you went to the dance house

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
as soon as you entered the house.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's not appropriate.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You have nothing to say now?

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Say it.

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What did you do to her?

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
According to Third Madam,

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm interested in her, right?

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I didn't say that.

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
According to what you said,

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm interested in her.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm interested in her.

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Then why didn't you come back to my house?

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You came to the ancestral hall

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
without sleeping in the bed.

268
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You did something bad.

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Am I right, Dad?

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You four!

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're talking nonsense.

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're talking too much.

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Who knows if Young Master

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
likes this?

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Shut up!

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was the one who made it up.

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Even if I like it,

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
what about Fifth Madam?

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If she's willing,

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
why did she stab me with a hairpin?

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Who knows

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
if you're acting.

283
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Master,

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
when we entered the house,

285
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the room was not clean.

286
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If she's willing to refuse...

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Enough!

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Stop talking.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You don't have to go to the dock anymore.

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Guards,

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
lock her up.

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
She can't eat for three days.

293
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Young Master, please.

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Dad,

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Fifth Madam...

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No matter if she's willing,

297
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it doesn't matter anymore.

298
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Tomorrow,

299
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
you'll be strangled to death.

300
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Dad.

301
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Dad.

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Master,

303
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
can I go back to work?

304
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Your master

305
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
is going to be trampled to death.

306
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What else do you want to do?

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Master.

308
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Everyone who betrays their master

309
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
will die.

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You should go down and wait for him.

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Master.

312
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Master.

313
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Master,

314
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
this maid is a poor person.

315
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How about

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we kick her out of the house?

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This kind of

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
trickery

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
won't end well.

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Are you the first day to catch me?

321
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you waiting for?

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Take her away.

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Master,

324
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I know I was wrong.

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Third Madam.

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Third Madam.

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please save me.

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Third Madam.

329
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Third Madam.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Third Madam.

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Third Madam.

332
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000

334
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000

Third Madam.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
