Episode 16

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I object.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Such a subjective guess.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
May I ask,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
what evidence do you have

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to prove that Nanxi went to the snow?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There is evidence in the Zhou's mansion.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They witnessed the night in Nanxi

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that night.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I went to find him

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
because I was close to the snow.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But I didn't see him that night.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I wanted to care about him.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But he didn't see me.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why should I say

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that I asked him to go to the back mountain?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Besides,

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the Zhou's mansion

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
is his.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There is no possibility of objective evidence.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Objection is valid.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Then,

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the most important evidence

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,960
is the

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This certificate of consent

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is not clear to me.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your honor,

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have a copy of the certificate

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
of consent of the day of the operation.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please have a look.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please have a look.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The handwriting on the copy is exactly the same.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The ink print on the copy is exactly the same.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The evidence is valid.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nanxi's left hand handwriting

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
comes from his signature.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He is a left-handed person.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But he never uses his left hand to write.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because his left hand

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
can only be used when he is guilty.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
His left hand handwriting

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
is completely different from his right hand handwriting.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
May I ask Miss Ye,

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
where did you get this certificate of consent?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
From the hospital.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As far as I know,

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
this document has been handed over to the police.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why is it in your hands?

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
As you can see,

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
this certificate of consent

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
was almost burnt down by the police.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I stole it from the police.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Really?

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This certificate of consent

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
provided by the police

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
is in my hands.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where did it come from?

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Your Honor,

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
this is fake.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's fake.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The witness has the right to testify.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Honor,

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm applying for another key person

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to help me with this case.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ye Zhiqiu's hospital's dean,

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Lin Huidong.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dean Lin,

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which of these two documents

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is Miss Nanxi's handwriting?

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This one.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It has my signature on it.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dean Lin.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Dean Lin.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not like that.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Your Honor,

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Dean Lin is the doctor

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
who was in charge of the production of the medical equipment.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This certificate of consent

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
was provided by him.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As for Miss Ye,

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the so-called evidence provided by the police

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
was burnt down by the police.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is this kind of evidence

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
credible?

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If I provided the false evidence,

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
would Dean Lin

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
also provide the false evidence?

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then,

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
can we think that

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
the so-called key evidence

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is invalid?

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Your Honor,

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think Miss Lin

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
is the one who stole the evidence

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and dared to disturb the trial.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She is being punished.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I declare that

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ye Chu Xue,

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
who was suspected of murdering Nanxi,

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
was released in court

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
because of insufficient evidence.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ye Chu Xue,

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
you're a murderer.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're a murderer.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What's wrong,

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss Ye?

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,960
I've paid for everything I've done.

112
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,680
I've lost everything.

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
What else do I need?

114
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,960
Not enough.

115
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
Far from enough.

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
Why are you still here?

117
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,320
Where are you going?

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,240
Zhiqiu.

119
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,600
Where are you going?

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,160
Zhiqiu.

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,000
Let her go.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm going.

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Zhou Yingluo.

124
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,920
I don't believe it.

125
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,160
I know.

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Don't worry.

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
I've sent someone to follow her.

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
At this time,

129
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,360
we should calm down, okay?

130
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,000
Director Lin's family is threatened by the police.

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,880
She has to be the witness.

132
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,600
Police?

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,760
I understand.

134
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,400
In Nanxi's hands,

135
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,800
there must be an iron certificate that can prove Zhou Quan.

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
So Zhou Quan

137
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,040
will protect her with all his might.

138
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,400
Yes.

139
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
To get rid of her,

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,120
we must get rid of my uncle.

141
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,640
It's okay. Don't worry.

142
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
Leave it to me.

143
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Eat it.

144
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
Well,

145
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,880
I also want to see with you.

146
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,840
No.

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
Go take a good rest again.

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,160
Manager Lu.

149
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,000
You see?

150
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,400
Go back.

151
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,760
So what if I do?

152
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
My death

153
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,200
has already ruined

154
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,920
your glorious life.

155
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,840
Don't blame yourself anymore.

156
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,040
Get out!

157
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,640
No.

158
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,800
I swear.

159
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
I'll make them pay for

160
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,520
every person who hurt you.

161
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
Is this my obsession

162
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,040
or yours?

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
It's mine.

164
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,640
I admit it.

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,000
You gave up your studies and your future

166
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,240
to study with me.

167
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,480
You dragged me down.

168
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
I feel guilty and ashamed.

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,880
I did everything

170
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,520
to make you

171
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,200
live the best life.

172
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,600
It's Nanxi.

173
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,120
She ruined everything.

174
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,080
She ruined my dream!

175
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
You're wrong.

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,760
People

177
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,320
live for themselves.

178
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,000
I gave up my studies

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,720
not just because of you.

180
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,800
I learned it.

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
So I know

182
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,640
not everyone

183
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,120
is as talented as you

184
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,480
and can achieve good results easily.

185
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,040
No.

186
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm not that talented.

187
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,080
In fact,

188
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
my screamed

189
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,080
my love

190
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,560
that respect no one else.

191
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,920
You just said this.

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Xiaoxia.

193
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,840
Xiaoxia.

194
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Is there anyone?

195
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
Is Miss Ye here?

196
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,120
What are you doing?

197
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Why did you arrest me?

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Miss Ye got a report from someone else

199
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
saying that you used plant feces

200
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
to take medicine

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,640
and perform surgery on the patient.

202
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,880
You are not allowed to do that.

203
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,320
You need to perform surgery on the patient.

204
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
I used the medicine.

205
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,360
You mean Nanxi?

206
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,640
Master,

207
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,080
we sent several groups of people

208
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,400
to track down Nanxi.

209
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
But the police stopped us.

210
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,680
It seems that the evidence in Nanxi's hand

211
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
can destroy Zhou Quan directly.

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,280
This can also eliminate

213
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,120
the last part of the Zhou family.

214
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,400
Master, bad news.

215
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,360
Miss Ye was caught by the police.

216
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Let's go.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,120
100,000 taels of silver.

218
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,360
Is the treasure enough?

219
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Boss Zhao,

220
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
it should be enough.

221
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,080
But I can't decide.

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,920
How about

223
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,280
you wait a little longer?

224
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
My son-in-law.

225
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,960
I let you go last time.

226
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,040
Why are you still so poor?

227
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,320
Is the treasure enough?

228
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,840
Of course it is.

229
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,920
But my son-in-law,

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,400
it's not about money.

231
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,520
The medicine used by doctors

232
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,760
has affected the reputation and safety of the hospital.

233
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,680
I'm really not strong enough.

234
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,040
Who is it?

235
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,480
Mr. Yu.

236
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,560
You always make this joke.

237
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,920
You're a busy man.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,560
Why are you free

239
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,200
to come to my little police station?

240
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
Of course I'm here to pick up

241
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,040
my childhood friend,

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,480
Miss Ye Zhiqiu.

243
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,800
I heard that she committed a crime

244
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,280
and it's not a case of life and death.

245
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,160
Is there anyone who bullies people like you?

246
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,080
Mr. Yu, don't be angry.

247
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,440
We can talk about it.

248
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,080
Mr. Zhou.

249
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,480
What's there to talk about?

250
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
If you don't let go, I'll go to the prison.

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,040
If I go to the prison,

252
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
I'll be embarrassing you.

253
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,240
Let go.

254
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Hurry up.

255
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

256
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,960
But the money...

257
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,920
The money...

258
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,080
Since it's a treasure,

259
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,760
you can't say it without taking the money.

260
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,320
It's not mine anyway.

261
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,160
Put it down.

262
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,040
Put it down.

263
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
Wait a minute.

264
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,720
Mr. Zhou, we have a professional.

265
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,400
The bag belongs to Shi Miao Art's owner.

266
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,640
Take it, please.

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,920
And here are

268
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,080
all the detailscribers' directed Racing.

269
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
Give me two minutes

270
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,240
to summarize the anime.

271
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,640
We have written them down in the photos

272
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,000
and will continue it in the next two months.

273
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,120
Your Majesty.

274
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,640
You just had some external wounds.

275
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,080
The medicines will be all healed soon enough.

276
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,160
These are bothおお

277
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
It's safer to not leave a scar

278
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
sheet.

279
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,480
Then ignore the scars.

280
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,440
I'll go get the medicine.

281
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,800
You're awake.

282
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
How do you feel?

283
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,000
Where is Mr. Yu?

284
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,040
He... He's not here.

285
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,680
I...

286
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,480
I just want to

287
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,600
thank him in person.

288
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,280
What about me?

289
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
Of course I have to thank you.

290
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,120
Gu... Gu... Gu... Gu...

291
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,720
You shouldn't mention that.

292
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,600
It's okay.

293
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,000
Gu...

294
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,960
Nanxi?

295
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,240
Zhou Quan found out that

296
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
I sent people to follow him.

297
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,200
I also sent a few more people

298
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,280
to take him away successfully.

299
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
What about the driver Zhang Jinbao?

300
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,000
This man has always had news.

301
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,240
He didn't take the child back to his hometown.

302
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,640
He changed his name

303
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,520
and stayed with his mother in Wu County.

304
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,720
Now he's a driver in the Lu's wharf.

305
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,320
His mother is taking the child.

306
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,680
Nanxi knows that we're keeping an eye on him.

307
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,080
But he won't go to Zhang Jinbao so easily.

308
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,000
It seems that

309
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
there's a way.

310
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,160
He was a man who had no other choice.

311
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
But now,

312
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
he has a weakness.

313
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,080
Come on.

314
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,960
This way, please.

315
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,120
This way, please.

316
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,120
Come and help me.

317
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,320
Be careful.

318
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
Slowly.

319
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,800
Cover your ears.

320
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,520
Be careful.

321
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,800
Why are you here?

322
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,400
Baby.

323
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,440
I...

324
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,200
I asked the police

325
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,600
to help me keep an eye on the child.

326
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Actually, we're fine.

327
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,800
You should take care of yourself.

328
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm fine.

329
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Don't worry about me.

330
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,720
Granny.

331
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,920
Baby needs to stay in the hospital for a few more days.

332
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,400
At least,

333
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
he needs to stay for three or four more days

334
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,000
before he can go back.

335
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,200
Baby.

336
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,920
Be patient.

337
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,680
I'll take you home as soon as possible.

338
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,280
It's okay.

339
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,320
Go back.

340
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,840
Baby.

341
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,440
Baby.

342
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,880
If they find out,

343
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
it'll be a big trouble.

344
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,640
Take good care of yourself.

345
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,360
Don't worry.

346
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,880
Wait.

347
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,040
That way.

348
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,560
Let's go.

349
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,800
Get in the car.

350
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
Let's talk.

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,400
What's there to talk about?

352
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,840
Get rid of Zhou Quan for me.

353
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,440
Take my family to the Zhou family's house.

354
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,160
I'll keep your family safe and sound.

355
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,880
I won't take any money for the rest of my life.

356
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,880
Why should I believe you?

357
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Take the gun.

358
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
I'll give you a gun with bullets.

359
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,920
Money.

360
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,120
Freedom.

361
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
Weapons to protect ourselves.

362
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
How about this business

363
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,440
that you can't afford?
