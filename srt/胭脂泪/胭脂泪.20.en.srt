00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My sister died because she was too happy.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,600
There is no evidence left to give her to be convicted.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,200
I'm not the only victim.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,600
You should go find someone else.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,200
You've been looking for me for three days.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't think we need to talk.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,600
I already made it clear on the phone.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm just an ordinary wife and mother.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,000
I really don't want to get involved in these things.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,600
It's hard to know. It's not good for women.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,200
Even if I'm single now, I still have my own career.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,800
But these things will eventually be exposed to the public and be slandered.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I beg you to stand up.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
An animal like this

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
can't let it live in peace and be a tragedy.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm already married.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,800
If I stand up now,

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,000
my husband

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,800
will accept that

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
I was slandered.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,000
This is the list of the victims of the rouge.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
The person who was slandered has already rejected me.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
The rest are innocent victims that can't be eliminated.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,600
The truth can help too many people.

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Your testimony can change the fate of many people.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I can't stand up for this matter.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't you hope that he can be punished for what he did?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,600
I believe that in the end,

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,000
he will get his retribution.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,800
Fate should be in our hands.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Miss Ye, I admire everything you've done.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,800
But I'm sorry. I can't take this risk.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Then let's go.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm sorry. Don't come to me again.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry, Miss Ye.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry, Miss Ye.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,200
It's not easy to find someone to testify.

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Don't give up.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
I know.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,200
I won't give up. I can't give up either.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
I'll be with you.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Okay.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
Old man, come here.

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,800
Sit.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Old man, don't rush. Take your time.

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
They are...

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,400
You want to find the girl that Xu Jiaxuan bullied, right?

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
Yes.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,200
My daughter was deceived by that teacher.

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,000
This is the last letter she left us.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We hope to prove that bastard's crime.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,600
What's your daughter's name?

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Her name is Lingzhi.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Bastard.

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,600
You are the parents who accused her of bullying her daughter.

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,200
You stood up and made her quit school.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Yes.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,400
But we still couldn't help her.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Please believe me.

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,800
We will do our best to get her to be tried.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Are you...

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
willing to testify for me?

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes.

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Miss Ye, please tell us the truth.

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Your honor, she told me

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,600
that the material for making rouge

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
must be made by a girl.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Your honor, we have a list of victims.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
The people on it are all students from the female school

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,000
that Mr. Xu Hansheng taught.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,800
And he was accused of being a student of the female school

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
and was fired.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Objection. There is no evidence to prove that

80
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Mr. Xu Hansheng quit school because of a female student.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,200
No one in the school admitted that.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Do you have any other evidence

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
to prove the reason for her resignation?

84
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes, we have evidence.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,800
She accused her daughter of bullying her parents.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Please show us the evidence.

87
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Your honor.

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,600
This is the last letter our daughter left us.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,000
It's you, Xu Hansheng.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,200
She bullied my daughter.

91
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,800
And her blood is getting thicker.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Your honor, please show us the evidence.

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
Objection.

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Your honor, the real reason for this letter

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
cannot be used as evidence.

96
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,800
The real reason for this letter can be proven by the evidence.

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes, but it can't prove anything with just a letter.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
Objection.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Miss Ye, do you have any other evidence?

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Yes.

101
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,200
But they can't stand up.

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Under the current situation,

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,400
they are so harsh to the so-called true sisters of women.

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
A decade ago,

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,000
no girl dared to stand up

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
for such a thing.

107
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
They can't stand up either.

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,000
After a decade,

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,400
most of them are married and mother.

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
They don't want to stand up.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But they are the victims.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
They are afraid that if they say it,

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,000
it will be an unfaithful and immoral representative.

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Good. You said it so well.

115
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
But you said so much,

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
but you still don't have any evidence.

117
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
You...

118
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Of course I have.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What's going on?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What's going on?

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's going on?

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What's going on?

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
What's going on?

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
Why are they here?

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
Sit down. Don't panic.

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,200
My name is Ran Qili. I was a student at Rong City Girls' College.

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,400
I am willing to testify. I am one of the victims.

128
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,200
More than ten years ago, Xu Jiaxuan

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,800
had a marriage with me in the school.

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,400
He took my blood and made me a swallow's tear.

131
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,200
I am willing to testify.

132
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,000
15 years ago, Xu Jiaxuan had a marriage with me.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,800
This is the evidence that Xu Jiaxuan took my blood.

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
I am willing to testify.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I am willing to testify.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I am willing to testify.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am willing to testify.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am willing to testify.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
I am willing to testify.

140
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
He has a family and a wife.

141
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
He can't take my blood.

142
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
He can't take my family.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
He can't take my family.

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I will take my family's blood.

145
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Unless I take his blood.

146
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Su Wujing.

147
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
Please provide the testimony one by one.

148
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
We will carefully examine each piece of evidence.

149
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,600
Sir, I object.

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,400
These are all their false statements.

151
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
They can't be used as evidence of conviction.

152
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Objection is invalid.

153
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,800
Now we need more testimony.

154
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Sir.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,800
When I was 15 years old, he wanted to go to see me.

156
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
But my doctor gave me a false statement.

157
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
He took me to the warehouse.

158
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Not once.

159
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
He said the same thing to many of us girls.

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
He hates us.

161
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
He hates our family.

162
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
He hates our family.

163
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
He hates our family.

164
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
He hates our family.

165
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
He hates our family.

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
He hates our family.

167
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
He hates our family.

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
He hates our family.

169
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
He hates our family.

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
He hates our family.

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
He hates our family.

172
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
He hates our family.

173
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
He hates our family.

174
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
He hates our family.

175
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
He hates our family.

176
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
After discussing, we decided that

177
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Xu Jiaxuan, the right-hand girl of Wei Chengyan,

178
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
and dozens of other people

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
are all evil.

180
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
They have no intention of regret.

181
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
They will be executed on the day of their death.

182
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Congratulations.

183
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Congratulations.

184
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Congratulations.

185
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Congratulations.

186
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Congratulations.

187
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Congratulations.

188
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I didn't expect

189
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
you all to come.

190
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Thank you, Miss Ye.

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Thank you.

192
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Xiaoman.

193
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Xiaoman.

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
You are finally leaving Zhou Mansion.

195
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Sister.

196
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Did you see it?

197
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I finally avenged you.

198
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Sister.

199
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Aren't you happy?

200
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
You have a great future.

201
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
You shouldn't come back for me.

202
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Come back.

203
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Leave this place.

204
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
The farther, the better.

205
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
What does it mean?

206
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Sister.

207
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
What's wrong?

208
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I had a strange dream.

209
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I dreamed of my sister.

210
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
She was unhappy.

211
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
The murderer has been found.

212
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
It must be the words

213
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
before Guan Xia's death

214
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
that made you uneasy.

215
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Ye Zhiqiu.

216
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
You think

217
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
if I die,

218
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
your sister will be

219
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
in the same situation?

220
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
What do you mean?

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
If I die,

222
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
you will never know

223
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
the truth of your sister's death.

224
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
What do you mean?

225
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
What are you talking about?

226
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
What do you mean?

227
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
It's great.

228
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
I like to see

229
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
your suffering.

230
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Xu Ansheng.

231
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Tell me what you mean.

232
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I like to see

233
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
your suffering.

234
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
In the dream,

235
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
you often

236
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
care about others.

237
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Really?

238
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I have an appointment with the dean today.

239
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I hope I won't be late.

240
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
You have arrived.

241
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Do you need me to accompany you?

242
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
No.

243
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll pick you up after work.

244
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
All the girls in your class

245
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
are married and have children.

246
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
None of them

247
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
work in this field.

248
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
It's a pity.

249
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Although you

250
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
worked in the medical school,

251
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
you have accumulated some experience.

252
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
But

253
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
you are a girl.

254
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
You are a newcomer.

255
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I'm afraid the patients

256
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
will have some prejudice.

257
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
How about this?

258
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
You can sign a half-year

259
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
internship with the hospital

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
and go to the comprehensive department

261
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
to accumulate experience.

262
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I'll transfer you to the maternity department.

263
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
There is a shortage of people.

264
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Thank you very much.

265
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
But I have a small request.

266
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Go ahead.

267
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Dean Lin,

268
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
I have left the Zhou family.

269
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I want to apply for a dormitory in the hospital.

270
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm very glad

271
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
that the medical school can have a female doctor.

272
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Don't worry.

273
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
No problem.

274
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Thank you, Dean Lin.

275
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Dr. Ye,

276
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
the patient is waiting for you.

277
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I'll come right away.

278
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Dr. Ye,

279
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
be careful.

280
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
What are you doing?

281
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Dr. Ye,

282
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
I want you to help me

283
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
to check other places.

284
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
My chest...

285
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I don't know why it hurts so much when I see you.

286
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
My heart...

287
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Run!

288
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
What are you doing?

289
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Let me go!

290
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
You are a doctor. You can't just leave me alone.

291
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Let me go!

292
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
It hurts again.

293
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
It hurts again.

294
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Here.

295
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
I hit the wrong place.

296
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Look.

297
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Don't move.

298
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
If you really hurt yourself,

299
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
it will be troublesome to do the surgery.

300
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You want me to say it again?

301
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Let's go.

302
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Let's go.

303
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Thank you.

304
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Why are you here?

305
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Why didn't you tell me

306
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
that you came out of the Zhou family?

307
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I came out of the Zhou family

308
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
only for these two days.

309
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
You started again?

310
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Close the door.

311
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Close the door.

312
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
What are you doing?

313
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I'm checking my wounds.

314
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Why are you covered in wounds?

315
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Your wound is too deep.

316
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Let me help you. Otherwise, you will get infected.

317
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm fine.

318
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
It's done.

319
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Can I come to you

320
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
if I get hurt?

321
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Come here and change your medicine three days later.

322
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Be careful not to touch your wound.

323
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Where are you going after work?

324
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm going to transfer my money.

325
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Are you already

326
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
with Zhou Yi Mo?

327
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Let go.

328
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Answer me.

329
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes.

330
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
We are together.

331
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

332
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

333
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

334
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

335
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

336
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

337
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

338
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

339
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

340
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

341
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

342
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

343
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

344
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.

345
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm going to transfer my money to you.
