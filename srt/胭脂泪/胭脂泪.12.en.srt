00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He doesn't know anything.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Young Master doesn't understand.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
As you all know,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
all the affairs of my family

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
are managed by my disloyal brother,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Zhou Yichen.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For years,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
my father was sick and didn't participate in this matter.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
this is my brother's

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
disloyal brother.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He deserves punishment.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But Bai Haoyin Zhen,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
as the king of tea,

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
shouldn't be targeted.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What do you mean?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Give us a plan.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Elders,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
a rat can't change a boat.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Our common vision

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
is to make our tea

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
bigger and stronger,

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
go out of China and go to the world.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, you're right.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, yes.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, for this matter,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will cooperate with my father

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to handle it in a fair way.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will explain to you.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will destroy all the Bai Haoyin Zhen

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
my brother has hidden.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
At the same time,

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as long as the ordered elders

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
will have a potential

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
to make a discount,

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
we can use the price of second-class tea

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to buy the tea king, Bai Haoyin Zhen.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Good.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This rascal.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Father,

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you don't blame me, do you?

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Today is your brother's

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
bad day. You never checked it.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now you can stand up

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and see that

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
your identity is clean.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My brother took ten thousand

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
of ordinary tea leaves to make a good one.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What is his purpose?

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And where did he get so many

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ordinary tea leaves?

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I haven't found the purchase record

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
so far. It's so strange.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
In my opinion,

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
don't check it anymore.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No more?

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why?

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You haven't

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
been involved in too many things.

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't know many things. Don't ask.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When the time comes,

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you will know.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Since father said so,

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't ask more.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master, the third and fifth generations

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
have arrived.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Call Wu Jin.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Master.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Master, I...

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Get out.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Master, don't be angry with him.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Get out.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Third and fifth generations,

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you know his temper.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't make him angry.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Master,

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I heard you were sick.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I came to see you.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm fine.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You said you were fine.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're coughing blood.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Young Master,

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I should take care of you.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I finally have a chance

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to be filial to my father.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Please give it to me.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You must

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
trick him.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Master.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Father,

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
what did he say?

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Young Master, sit.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Young Master,

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you did a good job today.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You've taken all the blame.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You've kept the master's reputation.

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Remember,

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you're a great official of the Zhou family.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Master won't forget it.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But,

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the reputation

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that Young Master had

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
is still in your hands.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You need to find a way to solve it.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Please tell father

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that I won't let him down.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Young Master, remember,

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
this is the last chance

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
that Master gives you.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Master,

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
father,

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is father all right?

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm worried about him.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Young Master,

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think you should care more about yourself

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and the goods of the ten thousand eggs.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Tea is the lifeblood of the Zhou family.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Even if it's a family feud,

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Master Zhou should

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
investigate the whereabouts of the ten thousand eggs

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and the silver needle.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There's only one possibility.

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He knows

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
about this.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He has a bigger conspiracy.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's too late.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll go back to the Zhou family.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll see you out.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't move.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Go.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Madam.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Zhou Yuchen?

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why did you

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
join this troupe to attack me?

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't understand.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What did you do?

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How many people did you harm?

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't you know?

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't deny that I hurt you.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I have no guilt

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
for you.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What do you want?

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want you to help me

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
to point out that Zhou Yimo and An He

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
secretly stole the money

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to take the position of the master

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and set up a fake account to frame me.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Point out?

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What do I point out to them?

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
An He has a child.

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If General Lu knows

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that the woman he likes

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
has a child with another man,

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and the father of this child is Zhou Yimo,

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
how will he feel?

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Madam, we are in the Zhou family.

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have a short life.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
As long as you help me this time,

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
we can...

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Zhou Yuchen!

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You should go to hell!

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're so stubborn.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Try this.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is a good thing.

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
As long as you help me,

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll be fine.

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Open your mouth!

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Madam.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I promise you.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll make a fake account for you.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But I didn't make that fake account.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You pushed all the blame on me.

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
His child is still young.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let him go.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Pushed on you?

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You sacrificed so much for him.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Is it worth it?

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I beg you.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Brother,

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
when did you become so impulsive?

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You risked your life to save Madam Wu.

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Aren't you impulsive?

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You go first.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Brother,

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you killed someone with your own hand.

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The evidence is clear.

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you ready to go?

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Since I can't keep him,

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
don't you want to take him away?

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm afraid that he won't be able to go.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm afraid that he won't be able to go.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll go.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You go.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Go.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Go!

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go!

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Go!

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Go!

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Go!

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Go!

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Go!

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go!

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go!

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Go!

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Go!

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Go!

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Go!

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Help me.

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You two,

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
send him to the hospital.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Zhizhi.

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I want to tell you...

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Shut up.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Tell me when you're better.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm afraid that I'll never be able to tell you.

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Zhang Yimeng.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Zhang Yimeng, listen to me.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I promise

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that I'll never listen to you.

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're almost at the hospital.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hang in there.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You must hang in there.

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll go.

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The bullet position is not good.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's too close to the heart.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm afraid that the chest is too short.

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Please be prepared.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't forget to wear the safety belt.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll help you take it off.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I can help you

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
no matter what you want.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can protect you.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I always have one thing in my heart.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have to protect you.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have to protect you.

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I've had a heart attack for a long time.

248
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
I said that I have half a promise.

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
This heart, I can take it away at any time.

250
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,600
The bulletin is out of order. The patient is out of danger. Continue to read the blood.

251
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
Okay.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The patient is out of order. The patient is out of danger. Continue to read the blood.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The patient is out of order. The patient is out of danger. Continue to read the blood.

254
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,400
When did you come?

255
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,800
How can you care so much about her?

256
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
She could be the murderer of your sister.

257
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
No.

258
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,520
If I was lying in there, would you cry for me?

259
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,240
Like just now.

260
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,320
Yu Shan, what are you doing? Let go of me.

261
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
Answer me. Why won't you answer me?

262
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,720
Just because she is the young master of the Zhou family

263
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,520
or because you won't forgive me?

264
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,320
Your difficulties and the police station's problems

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
are not something that I, as a family member of the deceased, should understand.

266
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,720
I just want to make the price of every person who has hurt my sister.

267
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,520
I am very grateful that you can help me.

268
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,920
But in the future, please don't interfere with me anymore.

269
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,320
After saying so much, you still won't answer my question.

270
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,120
You are too guilty. You love her, right?

271
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Yu Shan, is there only love in your world?

272
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,120
Yes. And I only have this for you.

273
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
This is how it has always been since I was young.

274
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,320
I always feel that as long as you are here, my life will be perfect.

275
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,920
So please don't fall in love with someone else.

276
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,320
I will definitely give you what she has, okay?

277
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Senior Yu, please be polite with the martial arts of the Zhou family.

278
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,520
Okay.

279
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,520
Senior.

280
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Please don't tell anyone about what happened earlier.

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,320
I understand. I am very relieved.

282
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,520
Everything will be in my stomach.

283
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,520
Please don't talk about this issue.

284
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
No problem.

285
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,320
We will leave now.

286
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
Chen,

287
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,400
this time is really troublesome.

288
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,000
Mr. Zheng, you...

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,880
Let's go.

290
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
The commander-in-chief decided

291
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,120
to interrogate Zhou Yichen in person.

292
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,840
I heard he was here.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,440
He sent me here to arrest him.

294
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
Isn't he here?

295
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Take him away.

296
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Wait.

297
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,480
Mr. Zheng,

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,760
Zhou Yichen is also the second young master of our Zhou's.

299
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm afraid you're not appropriate.

300
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,720
We've sent a lot of gifts

301
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,880
to the commander-in-chief for years.

302
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,960
If anyone dares to do it,

303
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,320
he'll be caught.

304
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,600
Xiaochun.

305
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,400
Wait.

306
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
Mr. Zheng,

307
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
how dare you

308
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,960
to rob people in my police station?

309
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,000
Zhou Xue,

310
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,320
I just

311
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
found a secret warehouse of Zhou Yichen

312
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,920
and found a batch of opium.

313
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,760
Opium?

314
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,720
This is the ten thousand eggs of green tea

315
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,520
that was missing from the Zhou's account.

316
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,280
There are also a large amount of opium.

317
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,880
The Zhou's is operating a tea business.

318
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,480
In fact,

319
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,080
they are also doing the business of selling opium.

320
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,680
And the five people who died

321
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
at the front of the Zhou's dock.

322
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,080
The murderer behind it

323
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,520
is very likely

324
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,080
to be the second young master of Zhou.

325
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,520
What evidence do you have?

326
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,520
The small knife you used

327
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,600
and the fatal wound on the five people

328
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
who died are completely compatible.

329
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,440
Yuxuan, are you crazy?

330
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,760
Is this a good thing?

331
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
It's a small thing.

332
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,880
Kidnapping and killing.

333
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,600
This crime

334
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,280
is enough for the second young master to be sentenced to death.

335
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
These cases

336
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,120
have to be handled together.

337
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,880
Go.

338
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,240
Uncle Xiao.

339
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,440
Uncle Xiao.

340
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,880
Uncle Xiao.

341
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,200
Yu Shi'an.

342
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,400
Is this your first day with me?

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,320
How dare you push my nephew into the fire pit?

344
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Do you want to do it or not?

345
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,320
If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

346
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,080
It hurts.

347
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,520
Are you stupid?

348
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I just don't want to do it.

349
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,400
Please.

350
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,600
No.

351
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,160
You think it's easy to Dasuai against me here?

352
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,880
Uncle Xiao,

353
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,200
just in case,

354
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,080
I from now on

355
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,840
will put you up on fire.

356
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,000
I will not let you убíe down.

357
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,880
Tell us what you think about both

358
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,240
your side and me하�

359
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,040
to youtubers,

360
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,240
It instantly purple rolling on my shoulder

361
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:12,300
A gesture and his old hand

362
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,600
You miss윤

363
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
A gentle look

364
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,280
I learned a lot
