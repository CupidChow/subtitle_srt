00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Young Master Zhou,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you're from the Zhou family.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you have any questions,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you can go back and check.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Take it.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not asking you to do anything bad.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why are you so nervous?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I heard that you were born in the Qing family

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and your father was sick.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think you need this now.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't need it.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can go.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In these days,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't see many officers

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
as upright as you.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not an upright man.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I just don't want to lose my hair

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
because of my age.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Can you understand?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
By the way,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I have another thing.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I heard that

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
there was a girl named Ye Xiaoman.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We lived in the same room

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and lived together for so long.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now we have nothing to talk about.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She means a lot to you?

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let me tell you this.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Xiaoman and I

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
grew up together.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If it weren't for her,

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you wouldn't be in trouble.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You help me

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
means you help her.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You need to think about

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
whether it's more important

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to help her

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
or Ye Xiaoman.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you thinking about?

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why don't you go to the main gate?

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The main gate is for the upright man.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Please go back.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm just kidding.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's serious.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Five workers died in the front yard.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They were killed first

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and then thrown into the water.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So they can be sure that they are murderers.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then Zhao Yuchen will

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
reveal the truth soon.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
These papers

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
are all about me

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
spending a lot of money

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to find a lawyer to check.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There is no legal effect at all.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But someone

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
agreed to help you with the case.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Someone?

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your old lover.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not an old lover.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
A young and beautiful girl.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A good girl.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's like a medal.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not in that kind of relationship with her.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Really?

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The case of Anhe's rape

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
must have something to do with my sister.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I asked you before

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
about your sister.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
She didn't explain anything.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It seems like she has something to say.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It seems that leaving this couple

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
is a relief to her.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Relief?

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I didn't know that my second aunt

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
is not a good master.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
She abused your sister all the time.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Fortunately, on the surface,

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
my relationship with my second aunt is very good.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I often take her to the theater.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Gradually, she started to smile.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Young Master used to be very nice to her.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He took her to the theater every day with blood.

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So he made excuses

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to take her out to the theater.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In fact, it's all for helping your sister.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She has suffered a lot.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Aunt Zhe.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's there to thank?

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When I was not here,

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
there was a person in this mansion

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
who gave her a little sincerity and warmth.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not used to it

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
when my aunt is suddenly like this.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have a good future.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why do you want to go through this kind of way?

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No one in this mansion is easy to deal with.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What you did

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is equivalent to ruining your own life.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
My parents died early.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My elder sister is like my mother.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
She is all the motivation I worked hard for.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I know this is my obsession.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It has nothing to do with others.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I also have a certain obsession.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's too late.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it to avenge your mother?

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Not at all.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What else?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I want to take back all the family business of my He family.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Everything my father has now

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is all obtained by marrying my mother

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and being my stepfather.

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
These years,

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
he has been using all means to take over all the family business of my He family.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How many relatives of the family

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
are left behind because of him?

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The family is in a mess.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The family is in a mess.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sister.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sister.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is that you?

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sister.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sister.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Young Master.

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm the Fifth Aunt.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
recognize me as someone else?

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Your sister.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Who is she?

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My sister.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She used to be the one

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
who loved me the most

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in this world.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Could it be

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the one on the tombstone,

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ye Chu Xue?

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Didn't you push me away?

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why?

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why are you suddenly concerned about me?

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't you know

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that your father

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
has been watching me all the time?

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm helpless.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You mean

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you don't want to reject me

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because of your nature?

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Of course.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The Second Young Master

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Madam.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Have some tea.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Young Master.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is the one who was called

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sister by the Second Young Master

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Chu Xue

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the one who was loved by the Second Young Master?

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She used to be my personal maid.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She was like a sister to me.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know why

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
my father suddenly transferred her to Second Aunt's side

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and committed suicide three years ago.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I didn't expect that.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why did you transfer her

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
when she was doing well?

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know.

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My father has always been a man of his word.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then, did you

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
hear

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the name of An He?

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
An actor.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know him.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You don't know him?

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why did you ask me this question today?

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That day at the dock,

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I heard that on the Chuxi Night three years ago,

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
they humiliated An He.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
As the person in charge of the dock,

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you must know this, right?

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Madam.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Have some tea.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How could you not know?

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She and Chu Xue went too close.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Maybe those workers just want her to know

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that she is just a woman.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Madam is so clever and cautious.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The poison is not in the tea,

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but in her back.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm really sorry.

273
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm really sorry.

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I was just the third of the centimeters of your performance.

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, I didn't have everything as if they were real for real.

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I didn't have all of these operations.

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But,

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,560
I did everything

280
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,000
to use them.

281
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What do you mean?

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can do whatever you want.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can tell me whatever you want.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I will bring the best things in this world to you.

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I am the Fifth Aunt of the Zhou family.

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I haven't returned for a night.

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Even if the Zhou family loves me,

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
they will come to me.

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You don't have to worry about these.

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have no one else in this house except you and me.

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
As for my family,

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I have arranged everything.

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tomorrow night,

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the body of the dead body of the late Master of the Water of the Wuyi Tai will be found.

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
A body that has been soaked in water.

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
When that happens,

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
your name will be completely deleted in the name of the Zhou family.

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Are you crazy?

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I am not crazy.

300
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I know very well what I want.

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Look.

302
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There are the best clothes and the best jewelry here.

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There are even more than what my father gave him.

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And this house belongs to you.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The Dianwan River.

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The people who destroyed the Mato.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The people who killed the people.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now,

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you have imprisoned me here.

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Zhou Yichen,

311
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
where is your conscience?

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You ask me about my conscience?

313
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It seems that

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
when I was very young,

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
my most important father and mother

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
were trampled on by the people.

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And they were broken.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But that is not important.

319
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Now I only know

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
that you are the one I want to protect the most.

321
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't lose you anymore.

322
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
My feet hurt.

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
My feet hurt.

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Please

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
let go of my foot.

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Madam,

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
stop playing these tricks with me, okay?

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
can't escape.

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I didn't expect

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that I have an old foot.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's so painful.

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If I keep doing this,

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I will get sick.

335
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I can let go of the foot.

336
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But do you think

337
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
someone will come to save you?

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
On your way to the next life,

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
you have been losing this.

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't be so hasty.

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Who are you sending signals to?

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
My brother?

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a pity

344
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
that he will never know

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the existence of this place.

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Come on.

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Master,

348
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
the whole Wu County has been turned upside down.

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We still haven't found the figure of Wu Yitai.

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Did the police come out?

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes.

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They are all looking for him.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Wu County is so big.

354
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He went out alone at night.

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Where could he go?

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did something happen?

357
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Master.

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Master,

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
someone saw the figure of Wu Yitai

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
near the pier.

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He was following the river

362
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and disappeared.

363
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know if he fell into the river.

364
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What?

365
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Fell into the river?

366
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where is the body?

367
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Find it for me.

368
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I want to see him.

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I want to see him dead.

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't worry, father.

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I know the pier.

372
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I will find some good water stars.

373
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Go.

374
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hurry up.

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Where is Yi Mo?

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Why didn't he see anyone

377
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
in the early morning?

378
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Young Master went out at dawn.

379
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I heard from Nanxi

380
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that she went to the washroom to watch the play.

381
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Watch the play?

382
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
She lost her family

383
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
