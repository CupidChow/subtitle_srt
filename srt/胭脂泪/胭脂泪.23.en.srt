00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This month,

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
the things you're in charge of

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
have been handed over to me.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,800
Take this money.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't want the money.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Master,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
I was going to leave,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,400
but

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
my brother sold me out.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,200
If I go back,

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
he'll still sell me out.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He almost sold me out

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,600
before.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
This time...

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Master,

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
I really have nowhere to go.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,600
I can go to the kitchen to clean up.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
I won't let you and Miss Ye down.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Master,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm begging you.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm begging you.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,600
Master,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Nanxi has been in the mansion for so many years.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
She has to work hard even without any credit.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
She's a woman who's wandering the streets.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,600
Even if you give her money,

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
she won't run away.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,400
You have to leave.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Nanxi.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
Nanxi.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,800
It's nothing.

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,600
It's just that my father-in-law

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
is in a bad mood.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
He's excited.

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,200
He fainted.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
What did you say?

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Father-in-law?

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Father-in-law?

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Father-in-law?

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Father-in-law?

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Father-in-law?

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Father-in-law?

44
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Father-in-law?

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
You must take good care of him in the future.

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Don't let him be too happy and sad.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
You mean he's in a bad mood?

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
I'm sure of it.

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
The pregnant woman is weak and cold.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Pregnant woman?

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,800
This pregnancy is a natural opportunity.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Since you're pregnant,

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
take good care of him.

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Master.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm pregnant.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
The doctor said

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm in a very bad mood.

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
I have to

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,600
keep this child.

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Keep him?

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
What's your identity?

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Master.

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm just a woman.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Women can't

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
get out of this mess.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
What's the use of the Ducei De Tree?

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,200
In the end,

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,800
we'll get married and have a child, right?

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Master.

70
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
You're the only one

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
we can rely on now.

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Even if Ye Zhi Qiu doesn't marry me,

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,200
I won't marry you.

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Child.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
I'll make your father

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
willingly marry me.

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
This is the blood of the He family.

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
You can't take it.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,600
I can't take this child.

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
Yi Mo.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The He family is now in a dead end.

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
Now you have a child.

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
That's a great thing.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Although the child's mother is a maid,

85
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,600
it doesn't matter.

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,200
As long as she gives me a boy,

87
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,200
I'll give her a concubine.

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,000
Then I'll find a high-ranking mother

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
for the child.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There won't be any problem.

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll never marry Ye Zhi Qiu.

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Look at you.

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Look at you.

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
You're so unreasonable.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Madam, don't be angry.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Come on.

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Master is a young man.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
He's in love.

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
You can't tell him apart.

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
You're so thoughtful.

101
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
I've been with him for years.

102
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,000
I know

103
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,600
he doesn't want to keep the child.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,600
But he wants to keep the child

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
for the man who married Master Zhou.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
What do you mean?

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
He wants to make the man leave first.

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Next.

109
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Be careful.

110
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
Miss Ye,

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
I know you don't want to see

112
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Yin Mo in the hospital.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Don't worry.

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
I won't tell him.

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Master He asked me

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
to do a lot of work.

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600
It's okay.

118
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
This hospital belongs to my family.

119
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
It's not difficult to tell the director the truth.

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I know.

121
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,600
What's the matter with Master He?

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
I don't want to see him.

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm here to see you.

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
If you're not sick,

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
please go back.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
I have many patients.

127
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Miss Ye,

128
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
I know you were

129
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,400
the Wuyi Tai of Yin Mo's father.

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I won't agree

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
with you and Yin Mo.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
He is kind.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,400
I don't want to

134
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
make our ancestors

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
be disliked because of a woman.

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Although I don't object to your decision,

137
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,600
it doesn't mean I have accepted you.

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,600
When you're with Yin Mo,

139
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
you should persuade him

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
to give us a good job.

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
The maid named Nanxi,

142
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,800
she has Yin Mo's child.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
You should help Yin Mo

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
to handle this.

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,400
She's a maid.

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,400
She won't affect your position.

147
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
You should be kind.

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,600
Don't be a fool

149
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
to like Yin Mo

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,600
and be a good maid.

151
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
Do you understand?

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
I do.

153
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
You're old.

154
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
You have some symptoms.

155
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
But I can't see this disease.

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
You're out of the house.

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
What do you mean?

158
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
What does your family

159
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,400
have to do with me?

160
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Nanxi is pregnant with the child of Master Zhou.

161
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,600
What can I do for her?

162
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Mrs. He,

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
I have to go back to work.

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,000
Take care.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
It seems

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,600
you're addicted to alcohol.

167
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Why don't you

168
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
take action against me?

169
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
No, I won't.

170
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Miss Ye,

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,400
you'll leave this hospital.

172
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
For example,

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
on the way to work,

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
or on the way to buy groceries,

175
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
accidents will happen.

176
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
Are you threatening me?

177
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm just reminding you.

178
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Go.

179
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
I heard

180
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,000
someone made trouble in the hospital.

181
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,800
Our guns are blind.

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
They're here for the diagnosis.

183
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,200
Dr. Ye,

184
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,800
is this old woman finished reading?

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
If so, we have to read it.

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I'm done.

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Don't tell anyone

188
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
about the innocent.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,800
I took care of Dr. Ye.

190
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
If your family

191
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
dares to go against me,

192
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,600
consider your own strength.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,400
As you said,

194
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,600
accidents

195
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
may happen.

196
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Thank you for your help.

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
You're welcome.

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you.

199
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I heard

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
about the Zhou family.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
Recently, I sent people

202
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
to protect you.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Why are you so serious?

204
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
It's just a small talk.

205
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
He won't do anything.

206
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
If you do this,

207
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
you'll scare the patients away.

208
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't care.

209
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
I just want to protect you.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Beat him!

211
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Beat him!

212
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Yueshan, are you crazy?

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
Your family is crazy.

214
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
They're like crazy dogs.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
What do you mean?

216
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I hit you on the head

217
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
to teach you a lesson.

218
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Next time,

219
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
if you dare to

220
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
trouble Ye Xiaoman again,

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,200
I'll burn all the property

222
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
of the Zhou family and the He family.

223
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
What's wrong with my grandma?

224
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Ye Xiaoman will be protected by me.

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,800
Do you understand?

226
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Let's go.

227
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Nanxi,

228
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
you like sour things so much.

229
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Yes, Madam.

230
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I don't know why

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,800
I've been into sour things recently.

232
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Grandma,

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,000
why didn't you tell me

234
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
and go to her?

235
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
She's been being unkind to me

236
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
because of Nanxi.

237
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
If you do this,

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
things will only get worse.

239
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
You think I'm kidding?

240
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm the head of the He family.

241
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
I can go to her house

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
and talk to her

243
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
as a little girl.

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
I've already given her

245
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,400
a lot of respect.

246
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,200
What else does she want?

247
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
She wants to be a good daughter

248
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,600
and a woman like her.

249
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
I've seen a lot of women like her.

250
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,000
She just wants to

251
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
make a small mistake.

252
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
She wants to take the money

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
to gain more benefits for herself.

254
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
Don't interfere with my business anymore,

255
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
okay?

256
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

257
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
Please calm down, Madam.

258
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Please calm down, Master.

259
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,800
It's all my fault.

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't want any title.

262
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,200
I just want to give birth to this child safely.

263
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
I can continue to be a maid in this house.

264
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Even if...

265
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Even if I don't tell the child

266
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,400
who his mother is.

267
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Master.

268
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Master, I'm begging you.

269
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
You're quite a good girl.

270
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't worry.

271
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,200
As long as you give me a boy,

272
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll be your old lady.

273
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
I'll make you a good wife.

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800
Can you stop interfering with my business?

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're ridiculous.

276
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Grandma.

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm begging you.

278
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Don't go to find Ye Zhi Qiu anymore.

279
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Okay?

280
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
It seems that I can't

281
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
make any decisions in this family.

282
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
Zhou Yi Mo.

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
You've grown up.

284
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
You're strong now.

285
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
You don't need grandma anymore.

286
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm telling you.

287
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
This matter is settled.

288
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Go and help her up.

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Yes.

290
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Don't tire my great-grandson.

291
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Don't worry.

292
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
As long as you give me a boy,

293
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
I'll be your old lady.

294
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,400
I'll listen to you.

295
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Eat.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
The next day, where were you?

297
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Were you single?

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
One minute without you,

299
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
I'm feeling lonely.

300
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,600
I want to share with you

301
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
the new and romantic days.

302
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Goodbye, you and me.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm leaving.

304
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm leaving.

305
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm leaving.

306
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm leaving.

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm leaving.

308
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm leaving.

309
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,200

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm leaving.

312
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm leaving.

313
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm leaving.

314
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm leaving.

315
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
I'm leaving.

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm leaving.

317
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm leaving.

318
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm leaving.

319
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
I'm leaving.

320
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm leaving.

321

I'm leaving.

326
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
Look for her

327
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,360
She looks like a princess.

328
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Perfect.

329
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
I'm looking for you.

330
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,200
Wait for me

331
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Oh.

332
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Young master.

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
I'll be waiting for you.

334
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Are there anypaper?

Yes.

336
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Give me money.

337
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,000
Help yourself.

338
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,560
