1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,000
So for the past few months, you haven't been looking for Ye Zhi Qiu, right?

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,600
I tried to look for him a few times.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,700
But Ye Zhi Qiu doesn't want to see him.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,800
If it's to protect him day and night,

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,200
there's no chance for the family.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,400
Right now,

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
we're just waiting for the child to be born.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,600
If you're not a boy, what are you going to do?

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
If the family doesn't let you,

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,000
the old lady won't help you.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,400
I've already spent money to take care of the old lady.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,600
She's not a boy.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
I must make her a boy too.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Baby, today,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,600
we're going to learn a new poem.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
You have to read it carefully.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
You'll grow into a smart boy.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
The Poem of Nanxi

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,000
The Poem of Nanxi, no matter which aspect it is,

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
it has nothing to do with these poems.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Did I suspect the wrong person?

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
The Poem of Nanxi, no matter which aspect it is,

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
it has nothing to do with these poems.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
What's wrong?

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm not welcome.

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
The night is already very deep.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,000
And I've already told you, Deputy Chief Yu.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're always like this. The hospital is under a lot of pressure.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm just protecting your safety.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
The matter at the hospital has nothing to do with me.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll let the brothers stay in a place that's a little bit far from the hospital.

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
What do you think?

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,200
Are you protecting me

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
or not wanting Zhou Yi Mo to come find me?

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
When I was in the police station,

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,600
the best thing to do was to find a pen.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
The same person could have written two completely different style of handwriting.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Isn't it very difficult to write?

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Maybe you didn't find the right method.

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll demonstrate it to you.

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
The Poem of Nanxi, No. 3

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,200
A person can write with his right hand or left hand.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
It's just that it's possible to be different.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Between the black words

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,200
There are white memories

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,800
I read it first before I went to bed

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Memories of the past slowly become a piece of paper

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,800
One page, one page, little by little

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Who wants to be gentle and write a few lines

52
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
But I've never changed

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
The stars fall apart and the most brilliant

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,400
Just talk nicely. Why are you so close to me?

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm curious

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Why do you keep suspecting that maid?

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Actually, I've been suspecting her for a long time.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Now, there's only one evidence left.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Evidence?

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,800
I actually saw her on the day of No. 3's death.

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,600
She told me a lie about Nanxi.

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
And it was because of this lie

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
that I was suspicious of Nanxi.

64
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Three years ago, I didn't stay in the ancestral hall all night.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I asked Nanxi to help me hide it.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I actually slipped out of the house.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Where did you go?

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
I went to Nigu'an.

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
That night, I stayed in A'li all night.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I knew that I would return to the Buddhist school in the future.

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,600
I knew that I would return to the Buddhist school in the future.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
So, this is the best place for me to go in my life.

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,800
I will use my future to pay off my sins.

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm leaving. Take care.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
So, the Chuxi Night three years ago,

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
Nanxi didn't stay with San Yitai.

77
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,200
But she kept thinking that she could lie to San Yitai

78
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,000
and fool him by proving that she wasn't there.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Until she realized that I was Chu Xue's sister.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
Everything changed.

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,400
But these might just be your own guess.

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,600
She might not be the murderer, right?

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
So, these handwriting is the most important evidence.

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
San Yitai didn't know much about it.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,200
And the crystal body requires a long time of training.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
How did she do it?

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,400
And look at these play pieces.

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,400
I can't see anything wrong with this.

89
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,200
I learned from An He that these pieces

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,600
were newly popular in the past two years.

91
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,200
According to Nanxi, this was just when San Yitai came to the mansion.

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
The timeline is wrong.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
This is fake evidence made by Nanxi.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
So, I think she already knows my identity.

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,400
How about this? I'll tie her up for you.

96
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,200
I'll let her show you the handwriting on her left and right hands.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,200
Or I'll just kill her and avenge you.

98
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,400
No.

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,400
I don't just want her to be punished in the mortal world.

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
I want her to be punished in hell

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
and be clearly engraved on her body.

102
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,400
This water might be a little too salty.

103
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
This water is spiritual.

104
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,000
Drink it. It will surely keep you alive.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Remember, if you're sincere, you'll be spiritual.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,200
What's wrong with you?

107
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
My stomach.

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Hurry and sit down.

109
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
My stomach.

110
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
What's going on?

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Hurry.

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
The child's fetus position is a little abnormal.

113
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Get lost. You're a man.

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't want you to explain it to me.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you keep being like this, you might die.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Get out of the way.

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
The best fetus is here.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
How can a man treat a woman?

119
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
This is a hospital.

120
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
What hospital?

121
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Get out of here.

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
You can't do this.

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Madam He.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Madam He.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
Oh no, Madam He.

126
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
The child's fetus position is abnormal.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,400
His feet are also showing.

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
What should we do?

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
Hurry and protect the child.

130
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
The Yi-Demon needs a descendant.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
We need a successor.

132
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Hurry and protect the child.

133
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,800
But now, I think the adults and children can't be protected anymore.

134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm afraid I can't do anything.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Aren't you the best pregnant woman in Wu County?

136
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,800
This child has been here for too long.

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
It seems like he hasn't moved.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,600
I don't dare to take such a big responsibility.

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Please leave.

140
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,800
We need to do a prenatal abortion immediately.

141
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Prenatal abortion?

142
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
What is prenatal abortion?

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's the meaning of killing the chicken and taking the eggs.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,400
It's to help you protect the child.

145
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,600
I've always said that the hospital can do this.

146
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Why must I take such a big responsibility?

147
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Okay, let's go out and wait.

148
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Wait for our He family's eldest grandson.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,800
Doctor, please save me.

150
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Please don't give up on me.

151
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Please.

152
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,400
The child is now in the full moon.

153
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,200
I haven't seen my eldest grandson in months.

154
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,800
You've never been here.

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,200
Master, even though this child is premature,

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
everyone is praising him for not being a child of the moon.

157
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Yi Mo, with your status and status today,

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you should prepare the child's full moon.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,400
This child is not from the Zhou family or the He family.

160
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,000
How can you prepare the full moon for him?

161
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,400
You bitch. What nonsense are you talking about?

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,800
This child is from the Zhou family's driver, Zhang Jin Bao.

163
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Miss Ye, don't talk nonsense.

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Madam He, don't you find it strange?

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Half a month ago, Nan Xi gave birth to this child.

166
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,400
According to the time, it should be a premature child.

167
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
But since the child was born,

168
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,400
whether it's from a golden age or a long life, it's no different from a normal child.

169
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
This shouldn't be its appearance.

170
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Madam, whether it's from a large or small weight,

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,600
or the state it's in now, it's still a full moon child.

172
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,000
That's because my child is from the He family.

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
He eats well and grows well.

174
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Really?

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,400
But I have all the medical records of all your patients in the hospital.

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Before you and Zhou Yi Mo were in the same bed,

177
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
you were already diagnosed with pregnancy in the hospital.

178
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
Here, Miss Ye.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Can you give me these?

180
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
Of course.

181
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Thank you.

182
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Thank you. Oh, right. Here's this for you.

183
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,400
I remember you like to eat small fish.

184
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,800
What? You've lost your memory?

185
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,800
You deliberately framed Zhou Yi Mo

186
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
to make him take over your child with Zhang Jin Bao.

187
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,600
So you knew from the start, right?

188
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Sorry.

189
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll explain it to you later.

190
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Nan Xi!

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Explain it to me!

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Madam, Ye Zhi Qiu is the one who did this!

193
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
He's trying to slander me!

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Don't believe him!

195
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,400
Nan Xi, I'm a doctor.

196
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Since I have evidence to prove it to you,

197
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,400
I have countless ways to prove that the child is Zhang Jin Bao

198
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
and not Zhou Yi Mo.

199
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,200
But the method is more cruel.

200
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Do you dare to bring the child out to confront me?

201
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,800
You!

202
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Master, the child is innocent.

203
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,200
It's all my fault. I'm willing to accept all the punishment for them.

204
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Zhang Jin Bao!

205
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Master, I'm sorry.

206
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Zhang Jin Bao, you've disappointed me.

208
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
What kind of birthday is this?

209
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Madam!

210
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,200
This is just a appetizer.

211
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,400
You have to pay the most painful price for your crime.

212
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Miss Ye, you just reported that

213
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
there's a suspect in Zhou's mansion who's suspected of two cases.

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800
Where is he?

215
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
It's him.

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Four years ago, Nan Xi faked the suicide of Chu Xue

217
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,200
and asked the butler, Xu Han Sheng, to come to the Hua Yan Department Store in Zhou's mansion.

218
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,200
He was so shocked when he heard that Chu Xue was the victim of the butler's death.

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
He was so suspicious.

220
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
A few months ago,

221
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,000
the third son of Zhou's mansion was faked to be a fake.

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
His suicide note

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is exactly the same as the letter he wrote four years ago.

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This is the evidence of Nan Xi's two cases

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that I collected this year.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
These notes are totally different from mine.

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They are totally different from yours.

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But have you forgotten

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that the consent letter you signed in the hospital was used by the left hand?

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Where is the doctor?

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please help me keep the child no matter what happens.

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A'Dong, what are you doing?

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This is for him.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't worry.

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Miss Nan,

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay.

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Miss Nan, before the operation, we need you to sign a consent letter.

240
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
My hand.

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My right hand.

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Why can't I move my right hand?

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Put your left hand. Hurry.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Otherwise, the doctor can't do the operation.

245
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The Day of the Death

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The day I asked the nurse to give you the anesthetic on your right hand,

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I did it for the evidence that you had left your hand.

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You are such a sinister woman.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I never said what kind of person I am.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The Day of the Death

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay, Miss Nanxi.

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Now you are suspected of two cases of murder.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Come back to the station with us to cooperate with the investigation.

254
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Let me go.

255
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let me go. I'll go by myself.

256
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Take care of the child.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Our child.

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Zhang Jinbao.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Get out.

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes.

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The rose blooms again

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How can the love be stained with waiting

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The moonlight soaks the night

264
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The night is full of moonlight

265
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Suddenly the pond is white

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The snow-colored love is hidden in the mirror

267
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:08,160
Write a letter to the
