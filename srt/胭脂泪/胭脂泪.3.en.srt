Episode 16

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,200
Nanxi, take this wedding dress.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,000
I didn't expect that Wuyi Tai has his own opinion about dressing.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
I am so envious.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,600
If you like it, I will give you some.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,000
It's not a very expensive item. Take it.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't be so stingy.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
How can I be stingy? I like it a lot.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,800
Thank you, Wuyi Tai.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,200
If you need anything, just ask me.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,600
Smell it. There seems to be a smell on the sleeve.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
It's the smell of the grass.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,600
On the wedding day, the bats attacked me and the lanterns.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Where are the lanterns that were removed?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,200
They are all in the warehouse.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay. I won't tell anyone. I'll go now.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Wuyi Tai

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,400
It smells exactly the same as the one on the wedding dress.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
It's true that someone secretly made a handkerchief.

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,400
Steward, you've been working hard these past few days.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
It's good that I came to the warehouse.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Okay, Second Young Master. You work hard too.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
Wuyi Tai

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
He really came.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Yes.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,400
What are you doing?

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,400
Wuyi Tai

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Second Young Master, help me.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
You're here, brother.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Zhou Yingmu, are you crazy?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
You're here to harass me.

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Then, I'll change my place next time.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Please don't force me to do things that I don't want to do anymore.

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
Don't help Second Young Master to harm me.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's go.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Can you not tell anyone about what happened earlier?

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,800
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Good thing you came in time.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Why did you ask me to come to the warehouse?

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,800
I wanted to investigate the handkerchief incident on the wedding day.

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,800
I wanted to prove myself innocent.

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Then, what did you find?

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Do you remember that day,

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
the handkerchief flew to the wedding hall,

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
but only attacked me and Old Master who were wearing wedding dresses.

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
I remember.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,000
That day, the handkerchief attacked the lanterns in our house.

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,800
Yes. I accidentally found that the wedding dress had a smell of bat grass.

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,200
You mean someone wanted to harm Father?

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,400
That's why I wanted to go to the warehouse to see if my guess was right.

53
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Don't worry.

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Leave this matter to me. I will definitely prove you innocent.

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Why do you believe me?

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,000
You also believe me, don't you?

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Thank you, Second Young Master.

58
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
The handkerchief was stolen.

59
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,400
It seems that Wu has forgotten me.

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Congratulations, Old Master.

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Father.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
What is the big deal?

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry, Father. I've been misbehaving.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,200
When you were in the wedding hall with Concubine Wu,

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
and when you were in the lanterns on the wedding day,

66
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,800
you found a bat grass.

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,600
The smell of that can bring a lot of bats.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
Someone wanted to harm you.

69
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,200
What?

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Tea! Give me some tea!

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,800
All the rooms are full of tea.

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Give me some tea!

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
I want to see who is behind this and who is harming me.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,600
Go and check.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,800
Steward, there's nothing.

77
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,600
I know.

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Wu Yitai, you're in the way.

79
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I'll go.

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
San Yitai, sorry to bother you.

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Cheng Qing Wu, please.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Search everything.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
Why did you come to my mother's room?

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Get out.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
This is Father's order.

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Zhou Yi Mo.

87
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,400
Zhou Yi Mo.

88
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
You were in the warehouse

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,200
to destroy evidence for Second Aunt.

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Zhou Yi Chen, you're talking about evidence?

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,700
Second Young Master, I found it.

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
The

93
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,200
Tell me.

94
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,640
What is this?

95
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,200
This is my medicine.

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,160
What is it for?

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
There are so many people. How can I tell you?

98
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,080
Tell me.

99
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,200
It's not convenient for me to tell you here.

100
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
Just tell me.

101
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,560
What is the purpose of your purchase?

102
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,840
This is a bat grass.

103
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,160
I bought it to relieve the pain of the essence.

104
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,560
What's wrong, Master?

105
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,320
Don't scare me.

106
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:25,220
Why is there a

107
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,400
I don't know.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,080
Master, you shouldn't suspect that I

109
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,840
ruined the wedding banquet.

110
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,040
What do you think?

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,280
I just came to the monthly market these days.

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,640
I feel bad.

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,880
Then why did sister drink a few cups of cold tea yesterday?

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
Master, it's not.

115
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,360
That's because I've been on fire these days.

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,200
I only bought a few cups of cold tea.

117
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
It must be Ye Zhiqiu, you bitch.

118
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,760
He knew I was using bat grass.

119
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,040
So he put all this on me.

120
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,320
Wuyi Tai just came to the mansion.

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,480
Why did he put the blame on Erwita?

122
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,640
He envied me.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,120
He envied my birth.

124
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
He envied Master for loving me.

125
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,800
He has too many reasons to frame and frame me.

126
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
Then why did you show up at the pond in the middle of the night?

127
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,760
You often say that you're afraid of darkness and timid.

128
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,320
Then what did you do there in the middle of the night?

129
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,760
I was asked to go there by a letter.

130
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,400
What letter?

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,400
What did you ask to do?

132
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,240
I

133
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,960
Say it.

134
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,680
Master,

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,080
we've been married for so many years.

136
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,440
You know me best.

137
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,680
I only have Master.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
I would never betray you.

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Uncle,

140
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,720
you're always jealous in the backyard.

141
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,800
That's fine.

142
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Now you know that I did it to stop the killing.

143
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
You even destroyed the Heng family.

144
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,680
Do you want to kill me?

145
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,200
I dare not hide anything from you.

146
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
I only want you, angle!

147
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Master, look at him!

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
What's wrong with hitting you?

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,640
Do you think I'm the

150
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,160
little maid around you?

151
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,320
You want to fight for your honor?

152
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,480
You hurt me and Zhou Mansion.

153
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
What's the use of that?

154
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,720
Enough!

155
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,040
Cheng'er,

156
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,120
send your aunt back to her room.

157
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,680
I don't want to see her again.

158
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Master.

159
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,520
I was really wronged.

160
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,920
You don't believe me?

161
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,680
Aunt.

162
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,520
Trust him.

163
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,920
Please.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,280
I don't want to see you again.

165
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,800
Sister.

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,800
Sister.

167
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,480
I'm here to pick you up.

168
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,920
Sister.

169
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,600
I don't want to die.

170
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,040
Don't take me away.

171
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,120
Then tell me one thing.

172
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
I'll let you go.

173
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:45,820
On the day of the

174
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,720
wedding,

175
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
you wanted to

176
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,240
pay your sister's tuition, right?

177
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
After tonight,

178
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,560
I promise you

179
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,640
to pay her tuition until she graduate.

180
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Second Aunt.

181
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,880
Master said

182
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,400
no one is allowed to

183
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
enter her room tonight.

184
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
Otherwise, I'll be punished.

185
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
Second Aunt.

186
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,080
Second Aunt.

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
Third Aunt.

188
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,200
Fourth Aunt.

189
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,720
Fifth Aunt.

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,040
Sixth Aunt.

191
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,920
Sixth Aunt.

192
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,960
Sixth Aunt.

193
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,880
Sixth Aunt.

194
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
Sixth Aunt.

195
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,200
I've finally cured

196
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
your red scarf.

197
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,760
Come on.

198
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,560
Let me put it on.

199
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
After a year,

200
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,760
I won't go to school.

201
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
I found a job

202
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
to be a maid

203
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
of Master in the Zhou Mansion.

204
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
The salary is high.

205
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,280
In the future,

206
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
I'll hire you to finish medical school.

207
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,000
No.

208
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
I don't want you to work hard.

209
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,840
Silly girl.

210
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,080
How difficult it is to get a medical school in Zhongshan.

211
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,800
And you're going to graduate in two years.

212
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,680
You must finish it.

213
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,880
After that,

214
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
you'll be a doctor

215
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
and take your sister away.

216
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,800
We'll take care of ourselves.

217
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,160
Master.

218
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,200
The blood is almost done.

219
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,880
I'll change your blood right now.

220
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,840
I promise

221
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,920
in three days,

222
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,000
all your troubles will be eliminated

223
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
and you'll be young again.

224
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,360
Great.

225
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,600
That's great.

226
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Chu Xue.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,520
If I can recover this time,

228
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
I'll reward you well.

229
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,520
There's a box on the door.

230
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Take it back to make up for your health.

231
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,840
Don't tell anyone about this.

232
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Understand?

233
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Yes.

234
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,960
I've often chased after Mr. Yin through the blade.

235
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,560
How dare you seduce him!

236
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
It'sength of human body

237
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
is worth to you.

238
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,520
No.

239
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,840
How did you seduce Master?

240
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,360
Tell me.

241
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,400
I didn't.

242
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,720
I didn't.

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I didn't.

244
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,400
If you dare to take Master away from me,

245
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll make sure you have nothing.

246
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
I thought he seduced Master

247
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,800
and punished him.

248
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,720
But I didn't kill him.

249
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
Why can't Master

250
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,800
only like me?

251
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,000
You're my sister first.

252
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,480
Then, you're my third and fourth sisters.

253
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,040
You're my personal servant.

254
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,600
You're my fifth.

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,400
You're my sixth.

256
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,120
You're my seventh.

257
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,040
Why can't Master

258
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,720
see through these women's schemes?

259
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,360
Master doesn't love anyone.

260
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,480
He only loves himself.

261
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
Tell me.

262
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,000
Did I really do something wrong?

263
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,760
You made a big mistake.

264
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,480
You hurt the innocent's blood.

265
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,440
Let go.

266
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,120
Let go.

267
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,400
Let go.

268
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,120
Let me go.

269
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Don't move.

270
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,200
What do you want?

271
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,160
What do you want?

272
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:57,200
