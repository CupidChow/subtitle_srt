1
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,759
Okay, I'll go pick it up.

2
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:54,479
Um, okay, then I'll call you later. Bye...

3
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:06,120
Ah, chubby, there are plenty of cheeky guys out there.
Do you know who else he's doing this to?

4
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,480
Oh, why didn't we go to the courtyard?

5
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,359
Oops, sorry.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,159
Forgot your glasses. How can you see like this?

7
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
It's okay, Jet. I'll go wash my eyes.

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,719
Forgot your glasses! Hurry up!

9
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,879
I'm going to the bookstore. Wanna come?

10
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,599
How's that? Better?

11
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,319
Um.

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,159
Is there something wrong? Who called?

13
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:24,360
We're not going to the bookstore anymore.
Let's just go home instead.

14
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:04,080
New! We have new books today. I ordered them online.
Want to read them at my place?

15
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,960
Not today, I have something to do.

16
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,439
Something to do?
Well, whenever you're free, come over.

17
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,240
Jet, why don't you invite me too?

18
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,840
Why? If I invite, will you come?

19
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,479
No, haha. There are many people here already.
Just invited New, what's up?

20
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, just because I know that even if I invite you guys, you won't come anyway.

21
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
Oh, what a pity.

22
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,919
Or is it true?

23
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:54,319
Hey Jet, don't forget about me.
Just say the word, and we're ready to dispel your loneliness.

24
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,360
Okay, tonight then.

25
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,439
Yay! Two by two!

26
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,159
Okay, haha.

27
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,959
New! What are you looking at?
Hey, this looks interesting. I want to watch it too.

28
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,720
It looks fun. I'm going to watch it.

29
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,040
Then let's go together.

30
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,079
I already made plans with a friend.

31
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,120
A friend? Which friend?

32
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
A friend from another class. You don't know them, Jet.

33
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,439
Your boyfriend?

34
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,680
Boyfriend? That's funny!

35
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,079
Haha, just kidding around, Jet.
Oh well, I'll go watch it alone then.

36
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,959
Go watch with your girlfriend.
There are plenty to choose from, right?

37
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,160
What? Where's this girlfriend? There's none at all.

38
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,399
The person who called you earlier.

39
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,000
The person who called? Oh...
Jet	Hey, where are you going?

40
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,720
Hey, where are you going?

41
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,959
Where are you going, New?

42
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,639
Going to watch a movie.

43
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,680
Let's go then.

44
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,199
Oh, okay.

45
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,519
New!

46
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,680
Oh... Jet.

47
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,680
Um... You're late today.

48
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,639
Not really.
It's just another 15 minutes until the national anthem.

49
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,399
Oh, really? Haha...

50
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,279
Um, New... How was the movie we watched yesterday?

51
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,399
The movie? Uh, it was fun.
Do you want to go watch another one?

52
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:55,160
Um, yeah, I'd like to.
But going alone might be too lonely for me.

53
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,480
Unlike you, New I have someone to watch with.

54
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Why? Are you jealous?

55
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,040
Haha, come on, stop it.

56
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,360
Hmm, okay then. Let's go watch it alone.

57
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,439
Oh, okay, New. Just a moment.

58
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:15,360
Oh my, why is it so hot today!!

59
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,040
Well, look at you.
You waste sunscreen for real.

60
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,279
Huh? Did I put it on?

61
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:27,279
Of course, because I need to look beautiful.
Why? Does my face not look like I've put on cream today?

62
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,639
No, your face looks tan...

63
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,240
Haha!

64
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
Hurry up and walk, it's hot in the sun!

65
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,639
Why are you looking?
Haven't you ever seen a beautiful person before?

66
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,399
Are you still daring to say that?
There probably isn't a real mirror at home.

67
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:46,839
What!? What did we do wrong?
Just because we think No. 1 powder is the best!!!

68
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:54,120
You gray-faced!
You two didn't even think to remind each other about choosing foundation properly!?

69
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,920
Yes! Tan-faced Low has always been real.
It suits you well.

70
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,879
It's about you guys!! You're not even pretty.
Just because you're rich doesn't mean anything.

71
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,000
So annoying!

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,560
Really annoying indeed.

73
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,600
Sorry, didn't see you there.

74
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
Are you guys ganging up on me!?

75
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Gang up? How would I know what's going on?

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,879
Huh! Why would we gang up?
Face to face, it's going to be awesome!!

77
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,600
So cool! I'm out of here. We're just kidding.

78
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:40,519
Sorry, if you don't have the guts to face us, don't talk big.
Get out!!

79
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,720
Geez, you're so cool.

80
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,039
Hey, we need to hurry.
There's hope for us, for sure.

81
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:55,519
Oh, it's really hot.
You guys keep babbling. I'm going first. Bye!

82
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,720
Oh, you're not going to use an umbrella.
Hmm.. it's hot. I'm leaving.

83
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,360
Oh... wait up!!! Ugly ladyboys!!!

84
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
You're it, Ugly ladyboys!!!

85
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not sure if this is real.

86
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,159
Hey! Without any greatness, beauty, or anything else!

87
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,919
Oh my! What's this?

88
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:29,279
What's up! Let's go, guys.
This area isn't that great anyway! It's full of pigs and buffaloes. Let's go!

89
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,120
Yeah, it's hot. Let's go.

90
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's go, So!

91
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,919
Pete! What topic are we studying now?

92
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,240
It's probably... human and animal reproduction, right?

93
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,200
Oh, it sounds difficult.

94
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,440
Yes.

95
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,480
Doesn't seem difficult at all. Just reproduction, right guys?

96
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes, want to catch up? We'll help teach.

97
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,679
What nonsense are you talking about?
New, don't get involved with this. This spreads STDs.

98
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,759
Go, don't forget to spread it to me too.

99
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,000
You're going too far, Jet. I'm just a charitable person. That's it.

100
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,879
My friend is charitable.

101
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,320
How about donating to me, Go? We want it too.

102
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,639
Wow, Pat, you're really pretty.

103
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,440
Oh, I want it too.

104
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Hmm, you squeeze your own stuff, Pat.
You have your own.

105
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,159
Right, self-made.

106
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,840
Hey, I'm going to get you!!!

107
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,159
Oh, I don't know what they're talking about. Absolutely crazy.

108
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:11,240
Oh, That’s bullshit Parn!

109
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,120
That's good.

110
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,759
Everyone, don't argue. We're in the same class, same gender,

111
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,480
but I'd like to be a female. Let's study together.

112
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,519
Everyone, show respect.

113
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,399
Hello, sir/ma'am.

114
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:45,279
Hello, students. Last week we studied human and animal reproduction theory.

115
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,159
Today, we'll learn the same topic but in practice.

116
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,919
Alright, don't think too far ahead.

117
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:14,080
I'll give you students a chance. You'll examine real sperm through a microscope today.
I've brought real sperm for everyone to see.

118
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,679
What do you say?

119
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:21,000
So, where do we get the sperm, sir?

120
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,519
Why does it have to be me?

121
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,200
Because you're the class leader, you have to sacrifice.

122
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,960
Exactly, you're the most suitable.

123
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,039
Well, don't be embarrassed, Pete. We'll help ourselves.

124
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,320
What are you helping with? You don't have to.
I'm leaving now!!

125
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,559
Calm down, Pete. Stay calm.

126
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,480
I'm not calm.
And why don't you guys do it yourselves?

127
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:39,480
Oh, I haven't got the mood yet. And I want to save some of my offspring.

128
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,039
Ridiculous! Nonsense, you jerks.

129
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,840
Come on, Pete. It'll be over soon.

130
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,559
What's your problem?

131
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,360
Come on, join us. I promise, just once.

132
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,600
Screw that! I don't want it.

133
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,519
Hurry up, Pete. Teacher Kron is waiting.

134
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,720
Add this one. I have a couple of clips. They're awesome.
I guarantee you'll be impressed.

135
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,480
Damn it, no! I won't do it!

136
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,960
How the hell did you get in here? This is the men's bathroom.

137
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,919
Damn it! We're all men.

138
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,919
Come on, let's go.

139
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:25,080
Damn it, open the door! I'm not doing it! You guys understand?
You idiots! I can't do it!

140
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,720
Damn it, don't come in here!

141
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,200
Hey Pete, are you done?

142
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,840
Okay, very good. Let me see, please.

143
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,159
How was it? Are you tired?

144
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,240
You did it quickly and spontaneously, my friend.

145
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,679
Hmm, not bad for a newbie, boss.

146
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,159
Did it break a lot, guys?

147
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:27,440
Don't tease your friend. He sacrificed willingly.
It's a normal thing.

148
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:42,799
Even the teacher does it. It's common. Don't make fun of your friend.
What everyone should do is to clap and thank your friend together.

149
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,880
New! What are you doing?

150
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,279
Oh, I'm playing with my mobile phone. You guys look beautiful.
Where did you get the flowers from?

151
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,000
Hehe, don't ask.
I secretly picked them from the waterfall stall.

152
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,400
It suits us really well. It just came naturally.
Accidentally turned into a flower.

153
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,519
Haha.

154
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,039
New, do you want one?
We can give it to you.

155
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,039
Oh, no need, thanks.

156
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,359
You look beautiful, New. Just stay still.

157
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,200
Yeah, that's it. Awesome!

158
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,480
It feels strange, though.

159
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,920
Aww, so cute!

160
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,680
How beautiful, right?

161
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,200
Wait until the teacher sees it. I'll be embarrassed.

162
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,880
Oh no, if you take it out, we're doomed!

163
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,319
Let's go.

164
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:22,640
Oh, where are you going?

165
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,519
New!

166
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,400
What are you doing?

167
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,759
Nothing...

168
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,519
Haha, New, where did you get the flowers from?

169
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,640
Um, it wasn't me. Pat and So gave it to me.

170
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,000
No way!

171
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,279
Like this, it's adorable.

172
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,160
Are you crazy!

173
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,279
I told you it's adorable. Adorable to death.

174
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,279
This is the cutest.

175
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,440
Indeed, it's cute.

176
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
How's it going, guys?
Do you like the clip I found?

177
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,759
It's awesome, dude!

178
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,839
Totally teen! Great job, man!

179
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,079
That's the best, Go! I can't stand still anymore.

180
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,160
Cut it out, Nic! I told you to stop.

181
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,319
Stop what, huh?

182
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,200
Stop aiming at my back, that's what.

183
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,200
Oops, sorry, buddy. Almost done, though.

184
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,559
Come on, chill, buddy. Friends help each other. It's all for fun.

185
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,759
I'm already going to get caught by the cops anyway. So, just finish up.

186
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,000
What's all this noise, boys?
This is the library, you know?

187
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,960
There's nothing going on here.

188
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,920
Nothing at all?

189
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,240
Nope, nothing at all, Jeedny.

190
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,839
Can I help?

191
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,119
It's okay, Jeedny. Let's go, guys.

192
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,720
Hey, jeedny, what are you doing!?

193
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,279
Let Jeedny help, please.
With such a sweet face, Go must like it for sure.

194
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,720
Jeedny, don't do this in the library.
People might think badly of us.

195
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,920
Who cares if they think badly? Good or bad,
I'm going to get what I want! If I want something, I'll get it!

196
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,200
Jeedny, you're not a girl. Others might not see us in a good light.
Why do this? It doesn't look good at all.

197
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,599
Fine, Go! If this isn't good here, let's go somewhere else then.

198
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:29,039
Where are my friends? Why aren't they helping me?
Let me go!!!!

199
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,359
Go, you're actually quite cute!

200
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,359
What are you staring at?
Have you never seen the prettiest girl in this school before?

201
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:27,400
Oh my goodness! We just criticized Pat and So, and here we meet this beauty queen!
She's like the number one flour, the best of the best!

202
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,519
Oh my, she's so fair she doesn't look human!
The prettiest like a fairytale princess! Even the lowly ladyboys exist.

203
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,359
There you have it, a dejected ladyboy with no one to court. Must be quite pitiful.

204
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:42,920
Even if I'm alone, I'm still fabulous. At least I study better than you guys.

205
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:52,519
Unlike you, who lack essence, I look even more ordinary without makeup.
Seeing me, one would be more respectful, you know?

206
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,680
Hey, speaking like this, are you picking a fight, Jeedny?

207
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,519
Fine, I won't accept you guys.

208
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:57,480
Meanie! Don't pick on us. Just don't!

209
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,440
Hey, what's going on, May?
Oh no, it hurts! Is something wrong, May?

210
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
What's wrong, Bell?

211
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Ouch! Ouch!

212
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,559
What are you guys going to do to us, Big?
Trying to bully us in school, huh?

213
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,559
Yeah, Nic is the same.
If you want something, just tell us. No need to do this.

214
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,559
No, we're just rushing to class ourselves. Sorry about that.

215
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,119
Oh no, it's too painful.

216
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,200
My poor husband! Oh no!

217
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,079
You rascals!

218
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,240
Hey, what are you doing? Let us go right now! Let us go!

219
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Please, let us go! Anyone, please help!

220
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,160
You two must take responsibility for us.
Coming to mess with us like this is not good. Beauty can be quite a sin, you know?

221
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,960
That's right! You both are hurting all over, you bad boys! Oh no, it hurts so much!

222
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:19,200
You both must take responsibility.
You're our husbands, after all. You brutes!

223
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,680
You both pinned us down first. You both have to take responsibility.
You both are to blame!

224
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:36,960
You think you're the best? You're like a monkey cups!
May and Bell, they're just fake! The hostility is real, the fear is real!

225
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,440
Help us, help us, let us go now! Let us go!

226
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,519
Please, let us go! Tell them to let us go!

227
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,400
What's going on here? Stop right now! Stop!!!

228
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,279
Teacher, these two boys are bullying us. Help us, please, teacher!

229
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,720
Yes, teacher. Kittisak and Kittiphong are bullying us, causing us harm, teacher.
It hurts so much, teacher.

230
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,480
It's an accident, teacher. We didn't mean to, teacher.

231
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,519
You're the one who's intentional!!

232
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:12,839
Arthit and Pongsak, let go and stop messing with each other.
Let go now! I told you to stop right now!!!

233
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,440
Really messed up timing! Oh my!

234
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
They're bullying us, teacher.

235
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,279
It's an accident, teacher. We didn't mean to, teacher.

236
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,079
It's an accident, teacher. We didn't mean to, teacher.

237
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,880
Teacher, I saw the whole situation.
The situation was like this, teacher. It's like...

238
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,119
Hey, Jeedny, let's meet at the library!

239
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,319
Come here right now.

240
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:44,359
Meanie!

241
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,960
So, what happened here? There was quite a commotion.

242
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,839
As you saw, I just walked here.
It was an accident, teacher. I didn't mean to, teacher.

243
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,079
We both ran and bumped into those two, for real, teacher.

244
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,720
So, can we go to class first, teacher? Goodbye, teacher.

245
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,680
Okay, then hurry up and go to class.

246
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,599
Excuse me, teacher. Goodbye, teacher.

247
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:23,519
These kids these days are really naughty, especially the ladyboy daughters.

248
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,759
Hey! They're supposed to be twins. How come they're not the same size?

249
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh, that's wicked! I don't think they're always the same.
Even if they're twins, they might not be exactly the same size.

250
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,359
And what about Nic and Big? Do you guys think they're the same size?
Even if they're twin brothers, they're probably not identical.

251
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,880
I think they are the same size, actually.
I don't know, it's just a sense I have.

252
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,160
Are you crazy? I don't think so.
Try subtly asking them.

253
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:01,559
Oh, and even if they say that, they don't really seem to match.
These twin brothers.

254
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,599
Yeah, but I have a feeling. I think they might be gay.

255
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:15,880
No way, man! Are you overthinking this?
I think they might just not care about the same gender stuff.

256
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,640
Wow, really? And they're bisexual?

257
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,319
Well, it's not certain, but I'm pretty sure these twin brothers are not ordinary.

258
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,319
These guys here.

259
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:37,640
So, today, shall we go and find out?

260
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,559
How are we going to prove it, Your Highness?

261
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,440
Don't tell me we're going to sneak and spy on them. Play it cool.

262
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,759
And are you guys coming?

263
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,440
Let's go.

264
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,279
Then let's collect the stuff.

265
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,079
Hold on! No need to collect, I'll bring it. The janitors will come to collect anyway.
We're already screwed.

266
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,319
Hurry up and follow.

267
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,559
Ohhh, naughty!

268
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,000
Come back here!

269
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,160
What did you guys see?!

270
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,799
We could barely see anything clearly.

271
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,279
And when we saw them peeing, will we really know their actual size?

272
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah, true. I forgot about that.

273
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,920
Let's go home then. We'll find another opportunity next time.
Those twins, finding an opportunity won't be difficult.

274
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,680
Yeah, they don't seem to be very careful.

275
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:56,160
Alright, let's head back.
I want to have some smoothies outside the school. It's so refreshing.

276
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,039
Refreshing like the smell we're inhaling, huh

277
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,039
Indeed.

278
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,240
Satisfaction. Go home!

279
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,960
It's locked.

280
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,480
Help, please!

281
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,000
Oh no!

282
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,319
Help, please!

283
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:47,319
I can't climb up. Who locked it?

284
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:07,839
This is bad! How are we going to stay in this school? Why is it so scary here?

285
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,480
Ohhh, don't be afraid anymore. Look at yourself in the mirror.
You're beautiful. You don't have to be afraid of anything. Seriously!

286
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:22,880
Hey, even if you're scared, why bite each other? Your face is indeed handsome.
I've never stopped being scared. The fear is real!

287
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:31,039
Hmmm, I'll smack you soon. Newcomers like us need to be prepared.
I've also felt the radiation of evil,

288
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:40,400
whether it's from overly beautiful gangs, the Olive Gang, or that Jeedny.
There are even other groups like the tough ones. We can't lose, you know.

289
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,440
Alright, I'll fight to the end. I've got the determination to study here now. We won't lose.

290
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:56,039
And what about your lucky number, huh? Scrape until you see the next new year's numbers. Haven't got them yet? Wait until someone else sees. Embarrassing, huh?

291
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:04,720
Ohhh, why feel embarrassed? We'll have to wait patiently for the lucky numbers.
Can't ask for the daytime ones. It has to be the nighttime ones.

292
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:14,759
We can't rush. Our parents can't afford to buy a lot this time.
Just two or three numbers will do, my dear.

293
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,400
Hahaha!

294
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,880
What are you two scraping for? I'll squeeze your necks if you keep going! Hahaha!

295
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,200
Oh no!

296
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,880
What was that sound, Pat? Did you hear it too?

297
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,000
I did, but I can't get up. Help me!

298
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,240
Ohhhhh!

299
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,119
Holy shit, please wait!

300
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,319
What happened to you guys?
Why do you look so down? You seem terrible.

301
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:16,920
That's because of you-know-who! What's going on?

302
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:26,240
You didn't sleep all night. Those two are the same.
They look like they've seen ghosts. Are they scaring themselves?

303
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,599
What happened to those two?

304
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,799
We were haunted by ghosts! It was terrifying!

305
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,200
Hey! Does our school have ghosts?

306
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
Is that so? Our school has ghosts?

307
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,079
Yes, we encountered them yesterday. It's just as you see here.

308
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,759
Initially, there weren't any. But now there are two.

309
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,799
Really annoying indeed.

310
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,839
Sorry, didn't see you there.

311
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,279
Are you guys ganging up on me!?

312
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:02,279
Gang up? How would I know what's going on?

313
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:06,119
Huh! Why would we gang up?
Face to face, it's going to be awesome!!

314
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,839
So cool! I'm out of here. We're just kidding.

315
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:19,279
Sorry, if you don't have the guts to face us, don't talk big.
Get out!!

316
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,920
Geez, you're so cool.

317
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,880
Oh... wait up!!! Ugly ladyboys!!!

318
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,039
You're it, Ugly ladyboys!!!

319
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,400
I'm not sure if this is real.

320
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,640
Oops!

321
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,599
What's this?

322
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:39,240
Isn't this your handiwork from yesterday's incident?
