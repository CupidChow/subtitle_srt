00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:09,080
Hello everyone. Today, we're going to cook noodles together.
I'm not sure yet, but let's go with this. Here we go.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,440
Next, let's add some chili. It's very little, but it's okay. Let's add it all.
This is it. It's perfect. Really good.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,359
This student here, she's just playing with the seasonings from our shop to make content.
She doesn't actually eat it. That's what the school informed us.

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,039
I love spicy food. Spicy food is my life.

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:35,159
Then you eat this dish for the shop owner to see. Let's finish this.
Let's eat now. Eat it all.

6
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,679
You're getting famous now.

7
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,399
If you don't believe, try to scroll and see.
Look at the comments.

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,320
Do you really like yourself so much, or are you proud of acting like this?

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,280
Still not famous yet, then just fade away.
I'm so beautiful.

10
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,039
What she does doesn't make her famous anyway.

11
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,560
You're right. She's the epitome of the world's mediocrity, this one, Jeedny!

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,159
You got it right. Hahaha.

13
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,240
Hey, go on.

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,919
Hold on, come here first.

15
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,520
But dress properly first. You're a student, not a delinquent.
Tuck your shirt in and straighten your pants. Look at your friends as examples.

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
Teacher, is this okay?

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,120
Not just that. When you go outside,
people will know that our school's students don't dress neatly.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,039
Dress neatly first. Otherwise, don't bother coming back home.

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,879
Put on your shirt properly.

20
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,960
You can go now. Have a safe trip home.

21
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,840
Okay, you can go.

22
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,400
Hey, okay.

23
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,680
Teacher Dej, watch this clip.

24
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:59,719
Oh, if Jeedny sees this, she'll be furious if she reads the comments.

25
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,080
There's nothing left. You can probably see it by now.
A clip like this will go viral.

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,719
Alright, let's make Teacher Yod famous in this clip too.

27
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,240
Add some powder to my face. It looks a bit pale. Hahaha.

28
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:30,479
Here comes the main character. How are you doing?
Why do you look so nervous like this?

29
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,759
Exactly. Look at you, all pathetic.
What other content are you going to make now?

30
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:44,759
Excuse me, Teacher. I'm not feeling well. My stomach is upset. It's really uncomfortable.
I just finished shooting, Teacher.

31
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,439
Eat like that, it's not surprising you're not feeling well.

32
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,080
That's the teacher who told me to eat.

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:08,400
Oh, but you said you liked it and you could eat it.
Why didn't you say anything?

34
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:19,360
You can't come and play if you're not feeling well, Jeedny.
You're the one who's making a fool of yourself.

35
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,920
But now this clip is really famous, it's spreading all over social media.
Everyone is rushing to criticize me. It's embarrassing and the worst thing ever.

36
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,959
I'm going to expose the person who leaked and spread the clip,
along with everyone who criticized me.

37
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:42,759
Those who criticized you are all over social media platforms.
Altogether, there must be millions of comments. Can you really sue them all?

38
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:54,279
It's easier to stop making senseless content like this. If you want to do something real,
just do what you're good at. Something creative. That would be better, wouldn't it?

39
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:05,800
You can't stop her from doing it. Whatever mistakes she's made, just let them pass.
Now, if she's going to do something on social media, she has to be careful.

40
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,240
She has to think carefully about not hurting others or herself.
No matter what, someone will always criticize us.

41
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:27,040
That's right. No matter how good we do, if we don't do anything to upset others,
there will always be people who don't like us. In social media, we can't avoid it.

42
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,439
You have to accept it and live with it.
Take what happened today as a lesson for yourself, okay?

43
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,319
Yes, Teacher. I'll remember.

44
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,800
Thank you.

45
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,639
Good luck, Jeedny.

46
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,560
I feel sorry for her.

47
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,000
She probably understands by now.

48
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,839
Hello, esteemed ladies and gentlemen. I'm Pat, Patharaporn.

49
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,319
Good morning, lady and gentlemen. I’m So, Soraya.

50
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,720
And this is our latest product that we'd like to introduce to everyone today.
Thank you so much.

51
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:39,079
Today this is the last product. Thank you so much. See you next time.
See you at the next presentation.

52
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,240
Oh my, is this a beauty contest or a battle of ugliness? I wonder for real.

53
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,399
Oh, excuse me, I think there might be some misunderstanding.

54
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,160
The presentation of products from Himaphan Forest is absolutely beautiful.

55
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,079
Thank you. No need to thank me later.

56
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,600
Yeah, why are you guys not hurrying to class?
What are you doing around here?

57
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm about to go, but I saw something unusual happening,
so I had to take a look.

58
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,399
And what are you all doing practicing to be models here?

59
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:27,040
Oh, don't tell me you're actually applying to be models.
You guys are brave.

60
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,000
Why wouldn't we apply?
You won't know if you don't try.

61
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,199
Yes, we may not be as beautiful as popular models, but we have our strengths,
and we can present well.

62
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:49,240
Exactly. Let's go, let's encourage each other to practice presenting.
If you're thinking of finding some extra work to do, we support you.

63
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:58,720
Yes, but you guys need to choose jobs that you can actually do, not just dream jobs.

64
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:10,160
True. Before becoming models, you two should start by handing out brochures, flyers, sample products, and then work your way up to being models.

65
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,680
That might give you more opportunities.

66
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,920
And most importantly, both of you must apply makeup properly beforehand.

67
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:29,079
Number one powder isn't necessarily the best.
Remember that.

68
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:36,799
Friends should help each other choose the right shade of powder,
not just stand around looking pretty.

69
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,159
Let's go, don't practice until you're late for class. Off you go.

70
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,759
Number one isn't always the best, remember that.

71
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:55,200
These guys are strange.
Despite them criticizing us, they're actually giving good advice, So.

72
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,120
They're telling the truth. Nowadays, they seem to speak better with us.
Even the Olive Gang seems to agree.

73
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,360
They probably see us as friends to some extent. Being friends is fun.
Criticizing each other is also fun.

74
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,480
The fear is real. Being friends is real.

75
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,960
I want to travel by airplane and jet...

76
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
jet

77
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,799
jet

78
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
jet

79
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
jet

80
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
jet

81
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,360
jet

82
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,200
jet

83
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,159
New

84
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,559
New

85
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,440
New

86
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,840
What are you playing?

87
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,320
New, play first.
You keep pressing our name many times.

88
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,759
Hey! No, the app is frozen.
I didn't press anything. I'm just translating right now.

89
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,480
Oh, really?

90
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
Um, yeah.

91
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,159
Haha, so are you studying for an exam?

92
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:18,440
Um... yeah, practicing pronunciation.
Maybe one day I'll get an interpreter job.

93
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,919
Really?
Wow, cool. New, do you want to go abroad?

94
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:34,879
Yeah, I like it.
Good weather, no traffic, freedom, and orderliness.

95
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:44,799
Um, that's true...
But don't go without me, it won't be fun without me.

96
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,600
Hey... Are we over that argument now?

97
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,240
What argument?

98
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,240
About... forgetting to kiss you in the music club room.

99
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh no! I'm not mad—uh,
I mean... I mean, I can't talk about this, can I?

100
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,360
Haha

101
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,159
What's so funny? Are you laughing too much?

102
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,679
You're too cute for me to accidentally forget to kiss you.

103
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,919
Hello guys, what are you up to?

104
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,759
Nothing much, Jeed. We're just hanging out as usual.

105
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,399
Ah, you're mean! I told you to call me Jeedny,
but you still call me Jeed casually.

106
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,240
Alright, Jeedny.
So, Jeedny, what brings you to the music room?

107
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,799
Well, I wanted to find someone to help me learn to play the ukulele.
I'm not sure if anyone here can teach me.

108
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,120
It's Mac playing the ukulele. Mac's into it.

109
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:05,159
Oh, hey! I'm not that good at it, though.
I find it not as easy as playing guitar, you know?

110
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,720
Well, then, why don't you help Jeedny a bit?
At least teach her how to position her hands or something.

111
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,159
Please, Mac, help me out a bit. Pretty please?

112
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,360
Does your room not have anyone to play with, Jeedny?

113
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,720
Nope, it's empty.
So, I came to the music room. Please teach me a bit, I really want to learn.

114
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
Mac, you could teach Jeedny a bit, you know.

115
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:39,000
It seems like Mac doesn't want to teach me, so it's okay.
I'll just wait for the music club teacher.

116
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,879
Come on, Jeedny. I'll teach you.

117
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,320
Really, Mac? Thank you so much.

118
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:17,200
I thought we should be together here. What are you doing?
The group chat hasn't been read. We need to go clean the meeting room.

119
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,480
It's okay, Mac.
Let's go help clean the meeting room.

120
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,039
Yeah, let's go, Mac.

121
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,320
We'll leave you to it, Jeedny.

122
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,360
Oh, Mac, what about teaching me to play the ukulele?

123
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:45,000
Let's do it another time, Jeedny. Sorry.
We need to go clean the meeting room now. Sorry about that.

124
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Don't get involved with Mac and the guys from Room 13, Jeedny.

125
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,759
Why shouldn't I? You don’t own their lives.
Just put your nonsense away.

126
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:09,000
They don't own anyone's life.
But, I just don't want you to get distracted. Anything wrong?

127
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,840
If I want to get involved, no one can stop me.
Keep your thoughts to yourself.

128
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:23,039
Speaking like that, you must want to stir up more trouble, huh?

129
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:32,519
Well, you probably forgot that you're alone. Being on your own like this,
I'm curious too. How good are your fighting skills?

130
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,240
Are they as sharp as your tongue?

131
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:43,679
Speaking like that, you probably want more trouble.
I'm going to clean the meeting room with my friends.

132
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,639
I'm pretty, yeah!

133
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,240
What are you doing, Bell?
Aren't you coming to clean with us?

134
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,559
I'm on my way, Pete.

135
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:59,200
The music teacher might be coming soon, Jeedny
If the teacher is free, you can ask for recommendations before we go.

136
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
If Pete doesn't come in, your head will explode, Bell.

137
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,000
Hello.

138
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,919
Yes, that's right, big sis.
I applied with my friend named So.

139
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,440
Are you free this evening? We're both free.

140
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:43,240
Yes, big sis. We'll meet soon. Thank you very much, big sis.

141
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,399
So, the part-time job we applied for earlier today, they called us to work this evening.

142
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,799
Oh, really?
Why did they call so soon? And what did they ask us to do?

143
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,159
They're distributing sample products near our school area.

144
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,399
Really? That's great news!

145
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,920
Well, not choosing difficult or financially tight jobs. Congratulations, guys.

146
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,079
We just talked about it this morning, and now we're already working in the evening.
That's impressive.

147
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:22,359
Let's focus on the job. If we have to distribute near the school,
we shouldn't feel embarrassed. Let's do our job properly.

148
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,119
Thank you all so much.
You speak wisely. We applied early this morning.

149
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,960
Yes, thank you very much indeed.

150
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,880
Awesome!

151
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,960
Thank you so much.

152
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,519
You're really good.

153
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,720
Mom has to be able to do this.

154
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Yes, indeed.

155
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,319
Excellent!

156
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,079
The success is real.

157
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,319
Let's go find something to eat.

158
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,599
Goodbye.

159
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,119
Happy so much!

160
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,960
Do you have a pen?

161
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,880
Do you have a pen?

162
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,960
Do you have a pen?

163
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,920
Do you have a pen, guys?

164
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,880
Yes, I have some pens to give away.

165
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,200
Wait a moment!

166
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,200
Oh, Pat and So are doing part-time jobs. They seem diligent. It's useful.

167
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,119
Yut, Nut and Pran tell me about this.
They both decided to do part-time work in the evening.

168
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:32,079
They thought well. Knowing how to earn extra income.
We, on the other hand, just ask for money at home.

169
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,960
Are you talking about us?
Doing the dishes is also a merit. So beautiful!

170
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:46,559
Hey, this Saturday and Sunday, do you and A want to attend a makeup workshop?
We'll have extra classes, right?

171
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:54,640
Oh, just two days. I don't know anything about it.
I prefer spending time doing what I love.

172
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,279
Well, I mean, spending time doing what I love is better than anything else.

173
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:07,160
Oh, I have to go collect the rent for the shop at home
and run some errands for the two or three mothers.

174
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,799
I probably won't be able to go with you guys to the workshop.
You guys have to record some clips during the workshop and show me, okay?

175
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,039
Sure, no problem.
Our memories aren't good, so we have to record clips to watch again.

176
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,079
That's right.

177
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,720
Look at them. They seem happy with their work.

178
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,799
They're happy, and so am I.

179
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm happy too.

180
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,960
I still don't have a ride home.

181
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,400
I saw you looking at guitars on your phone earlier.
Don't you like them? Why didn't you buy one?

182
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,240
They're expensive.
I saw a similar guitar before, but it was cheaper by a thousand.

183
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,200
Well, take your time and choose carefully then.
Maybe start with playing the ones at the club.

184
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,559
Or I could borrow one from Pete.
He has several. LOL.

185
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,759
Do you really like playing the guitar?

186
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:11,759
Yeah, I really do.

187
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,039
What's up?

188
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,759
I'm studying English. I happen to want to improve it right now.

189
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,680
English? I'm terrible at it.

190
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:33,160
If you know you're not good, you should study more.
English, you know.

191
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,839
Hold on a sec.

192
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,519
I don't think you and I will be studying the same thing.

193
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,359
Well, they said it's good.
So, if we're studying, then it's okay, right? What do you guys think?

194
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:58,279
Exactly. Since we're not weak in English, we think it's really good.
It helps us understand various techniques better.

195
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:03,960
It's not a waste of time to study here. We think it's really great.

196
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,319
Hmm. Let's go grab lunch.

197
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:10,519
I'm not hungry yet.
I think I'll go browse some stuff first. You guys go ahead.

198
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,559
Okay, see you later.

199
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,000
Bye.

200
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,240
I need to use the bathroom.

201
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,319
Let's go. I need to go too. It should be over there.

202
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,319
Oh, man!

203
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,519
Let's just go.

204
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,680
What's wrong with you, Jet?

205
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,960
I'm sorry. It's just... I saw an old friend.

206
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,480
A friend? Why do we need to hide then?

207
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,960
Well... I just didn't feel like saying hi.

208
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,920
It's nothing. Let's go.

209
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:18,440
Actually, if you're going to tutor me, we could do it at the café in the mall earlier.

210
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,960
Tutoring here is fine.
There's no one else around, and we can relax afterward.

211
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Oh, so are we studying or relaxing?

212
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,880
Relaxing while studying, haha.

213
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,640
If you're not serious, I'm going home.

214
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,519
No, you're not. I'm not letting you go without a ride.

215
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh.

216
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Haha, come on, let's get started.

217
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,559
When we're confused, we'll mark where we got stuck.
Explain it to me, New.

218
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,519
Here, this one.

219
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:06,759
Well, Jimmy is about to go to the market, so it must be where, right?

220
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:15,480
And how do you know it's asking for a location?
It could be asking when.

221
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,799
Oh, it's actually asking for a place. So, it's where?

222
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:26,440
Right, you got it.

223
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,640
No, I can't take it anymore. I'm tired.

224
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,720
We haven't even started yet.

225
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,880
That's enough. Today, we can only handle this much.

226
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,559
As you wish.

227
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,759
Are you hungry, New?

228
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:29,559
Not yet. The curry I ate hasn't settled yet... So, maybe I should head back first.
I haven't told anyone at home yet.

229
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,200
Wait, don't go back just yet.

230
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,279
Don't go back yet.
Let's hang out as friends first.

231
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,960
Um, I'm not hungry.

232
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,240
Come on, we're grown-ups now. You can eat.

233
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,559
My mom called already. We should go.

234
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:02,599
Oh, I said I'll give you a ride. Don't worry.

235
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,960
Let's wait here.

236
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:15,160
Mom. I'm at my friend's house, studying together.

237
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Yeah, it might be a bit late. You don't have to wait for me, Mom.
Let's have dinner together. I will probably be home late anyway.

238
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:33,920
I'll have my sister open the door for me later.

239
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:45,480
My friend in the room is named Jet.
I'll take home later, or I can bring Jet to our house.

240
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,640
Love you, Mom.

241
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,200
Hahaha

242
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,960
What's so funny?

243
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,680
Just look at you, New.
Your face is as red as a baboon's butt. Haha!

244
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,240
Well, Jet's face is just as red.

245
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,880
Jet must be drunk.

246
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,359
Oh, really? So, who's going to take New home then?

247
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,680
I can't handle this anymore, New. I'm crashing here.

248
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,839
Jet, get up quickly. Let's go take me home.

249
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm sleeping here tonight, New.

250
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,200
Oh, come on, we have to go. We can call a taxi. Let's go.

251
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,200
No, I'm sleeping here.

252
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,279
Jet, you're really drunk, aren't you?

253
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,000
New, your lips are so red.

254
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,039
What's up? Smiling all by yourself.

255
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,359
Oh, nothing.

256
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,680
You seem a bit out of it. Haha!

257
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,599
Hehe, I just had a good dream last night.

258
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,799
Oh, what did you dream about?

259
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,359
Um... I dreamt that I got a perfect score on my exam.

260
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,880
Wow, getting a perfect score must feel amazing. Haha!

261
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,920
Can't I smile?

262
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,240
Why not? Can't I smile about anything?

263
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,920
New, did you go for English tutoring yesterday?

264
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,240
How did you know?!!

265
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,920
What's surprising? Pete told us.

266
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,240
Oh... yeah.

267
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,279
Is the teacher good?
Maybe we should go together sometime.

268
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,920
It's good. Easy to understand.

269
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, okay. Then let's try studying together sometime.

270
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,640
Yeah, we should go.

271
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,079
Dew, don't skip. It'll be bad if we don't go.

272
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:37,319
Hey, Jet! Where are you going?

273
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,680
Jet!

274
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,200
What's wrong with Jet? Why you walking away?

275
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,079
Nothing.

276
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,680
Nothing? Jet... if there's something, just tell me.

277
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,839
New... about last night...

278
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm sorry...

279
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:11,920
Sorry? Why apologize? Jet didn't do anything wrong at all.
You don't have to feel that guilty, Jet.

280
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,279
I'm sorry. I mean, I didn't really mean it.

281
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,880
...I'm sorry.

282
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,480
Why aren't you accepting it?

283
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,920
Go?

284
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,599
Yeah?

285
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,640
Have you seen Jet?

286
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,119
It's been a while since I saw him leave.

287
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,519
Where did he go?

288
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,119
I don't know. Is there something wrong?

289
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,359
No... nothing. Thanks anyway.

290
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,279
Okay.

291
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,759
You're still cheerful this morning, aren't you?
