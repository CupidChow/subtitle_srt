1
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,159
I don't know how you came up with
this project, sir. I think it's really great.

2
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,480
Well, I just thought of it out of the blue.

3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,840
I just wanted to try something new.
There's nothing much to it.

4
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,120
I think it's really wonderful, sir.

5
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,439
It's a way to develop the students
and also elevate the school.

6
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,239
If it succeeds, we should implement it
across all levels and departments right away.

7
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,719
I think it will greatly enhance
the reputation of our school.

8
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,879
Do you all agree with my project?

9
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,840
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,799
We fully agree with you.

11
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,719
Alright, that's a relief.

12
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,439
I came to be the director of this school
instead of your father just this year.

13
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,959
I just wanted to try something new.

14
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,120
Is it okay with you, Teacher Mo?

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,000
No problem at all, sir.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,879
I'll take care of it smoothly.

17
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,799
Is there anything else
anyone is doubtful about?

18
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,200
There's nothing more to doubt, sir.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,680
We, myself and all the teachers in this school,
fully support you, sir.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,799
Yes, indeed, sir.

21
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,400
If it's okay, it should be good
for the school and our students, sir.

22
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,680
We'll help Teacher Mo in this matter
to the best of our abilities, sir.

23
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,280
Alright then, I'll leave this matter to you all.

24
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,159
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,159
Do you think this project will succeed?

26
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,080
I don't think it's going to work.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,599
Whether it works or not,
we have to do our best, right?

28
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,400
But Teacher Mo, you have to become
the homeroom teacher for class 4/13, right?

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
What can I do? It's an order from higher up.

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,840
I just have to take on the responsibility.

31
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,280
It's a real headache.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,520
If there's anything I can do to help,
just let me know, Mo.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,719
Yes, we'll fully support you.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Thank you very much.

35
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,599
I hope it goes well.

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,680
Oh!

37
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,080
Sorry, man.

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,560
I was just playing with my phone.
Are you okay?

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,879
Oh, it's alright.
Are you hurt anywhere?

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,960
No, I'm fine.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
Really sorry, man.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
We weren't paying attention.

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,719
Okay, then. I'll go ahead.

44
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,120
I've been living here for three full years.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,639
It's been three years of pure fun.

46
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,360
But my return today changes my status
from a junior to a senior student.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,560
And I still have to live my life in
this all-boys school for another three years.

48
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,639
Just imagine,
how fun and chaotic it will be,

49
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,039
with teenagers of all kinds,
all types, all orientations,

50
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,840
coming together in this school.

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,719
I call it "Friends Having Fun."

52
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
Hello, students!

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,800
Hello, teacher!

54
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,639
Nice to meet you all.
My name is Moreeya,

55
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,680
but you can call me Teacher Mo.

56
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,279
I'll be teaching Thai language

57
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,800
and serving as your homeroom teacher
for class 4/13.

58
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm also here to advise any of you
who may have any concerns.

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,639
Feel free to come talk to me anytime.

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,279
Right now, our class doesn't
have a class representative yet.

61
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll let you all choose one for yourselves.
I'll be back in a moment.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,279
Hopefully, class 4/13 will have
its class representative by then.

63
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,959
Alright,

64
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,920
how are we going to do this?

65
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
Who's going to be the class representative?

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Anyone but you, man.

67
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,439
What's wrong with me being the representative?
If it's not me,

68
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,319
then who should it be?

69
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,399
I suggest Pete.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,439
He's been the class representative
since middle school.

71
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,920
Do the old folks agree?

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,000
It saves us from wasting time on a vote.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Hey, maybe it's better
if someone else takes the role.

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
What about the new kids?

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,279
They seem eager to jump in.
There are two of them.

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,839
We're newbies.
It's fine either way. We're not picky.

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, as long as we can peacefully coexist.

78
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,120
Peaceful and quiet,

79
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,759
just like those two forest nymphs.
Are you guys residing here?

80
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,480
Seriously, how did you two manage
to enter the school premises?

81
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:33,439
Yeah, you probably just sneaked in.
There's no sign saying no pets allowed.

82
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,839
Wow, he turned and blew a kiss. Yay!

83
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,040
He looked at me.
He must love me for sure.

84
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,439
Don't get too excited! Listen to me!

85
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,120
He loves only me because I'm beautiful.
I can get anyone I want.

86
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,319
So, are they going
to be pets or representatives?

87
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,160
I think they're both.
It depends on the situation.

88
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Hahaha

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,279
Wow, if others see them not as people,
then they are not.

90
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,240
It's all about aesthetics.
We're here to study, not to pick fights.

91
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,600
We'll agree to never behave
in such a disrespectful manner.

92
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm not asking you to agree.

93
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,920
I just don't want us to bring disgrace
to ourselves like these two.

94
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,120
Oh, are they heroines? I don't know
if there's a mirror at home, is it true, you!

95
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,439
I don't think there is.
There's probably just a broom.

96
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,120
Well, what do you use the broom for?

97
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,879
To scoop up water to wash your face.

98
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,519
Look at your reflection in the water,
instead of the mirror.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,000
You three have probably got it
all figured out, huh? You're used to it.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,800
You know how to work it. Werk!

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
Oh, it's so cute, hehehehehehe.

102
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,519
Shut your mouth and do it 999 times!

103
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,320
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!

104
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,120
Stop arguing, girls.
Let's choose the class president first.

105
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,879
Yes, that's right.

106
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,200
The teacher might come back soon.
Let's choose the class president first.

107
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
Go, you want to be the class president, right?

108
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,440
I think you probably want to. So, you in?

109
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm not applying.

110
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,559
Because no matter how you look at it,
no one will vote for me, for sure.

111
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,440
Knowing yourself is good enough.

112
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,840
Darn, Mit.

113
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,360
Okay, the class president for us is Pete.

114
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,279
Okay

115
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,159
If the result is like this,
it's up to you guys.

116
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,480
Thanks for trusting us.

117
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,879
Hey, look at that.

118
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,200
Where are you going, little sister?

119
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,840
Well, the zoo is full, huh?

120
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,320
Why, friends?

121
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,879
Rhino!!! Just kidding.

122
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,720
There's another one.

123
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,080
There's another one.

124
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,120
Eyebrows or Ping!?

125
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,879
So dark, lol.

126
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,279
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyy.

127
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,480
Lollllll.

128
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,279
Let's decide.
The class representative will be you, Pete.

129
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,639
Sure thing, if that's what everyone wants.
It's settled then.

130
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,360
Shut your mouth.
Finally, we've made a decision.

131
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
Why does our Grade 10 class have
an extra classroom this year, Classroom 13?

132
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,919
Usually, each grade only has 12 classrooms.

133
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,320
I heard it's a policy from the principal.

134
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,639
They want to try out a special teaching method
compared to other classrooms.

135
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,759
How is it supposed to be more special
than other classrooms, New?

136
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,320
That's right.
It seems like regular classes like any other.

137
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,919
Plus, we still have to attend some classes
with other classrooms.

138
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
It's special because we get to
do more activities than other classrooms.

139
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,480
We learn from real things, real places.

140
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,600
In simple terms, we focus more
on practical aspects than theoretical ones.

141
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,480
Wow, that sounds great then.

142
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
So, in summary, it's pretty awesome.

143
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,320
At first, I was worried about
why we needed Classroom 13,

144
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,519
but now I understand.

145
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,159
Even though we're different from other classrooms,

146
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,399
we still have to follow the school rules.
We don't have any special privileges.

147
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,600
It means when there are activities,
we have more opportunities than other classrooms.

148
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,720
They call it special treatment.
Let's make the most of it.

149
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,559
Yeah, the girls in our class must be thrilled.

150
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,360
We'll have a chance to showcase our abilities
to the fullest with this opportunity.

151
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,639
So, everyone, let's focus on studying
and participating in activities seriously.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,720
Thank you, Teacher New!

153
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,759
I got a new makeup powder.
It works really well!!

154
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,200
Let me try it out, then.

155
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,039
Is this waterproof?

156
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,159
It has to be waterproof to be truly great,
even against sweaty legs!

157
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,080
Of course, it is.

158
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,480
What do you think, girls?
It's like we're cursed.

159
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,919
We end up in the same class
as Parn, Nut, and Yut.

160
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,200
Earth and sky punishing us for our beauty.

161
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,840
Exactly what I think.

162
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,320
Our beauty is such a sin,
causing us to be born,

163
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,840
and then that trio comes along.

164
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,679
Fadind is the most ruthless.

165
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,480
They seem really unhappy with us.
What should we do?

166
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
We have to see them almost every day.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
It makes me want to shut them up 999,999 times.

168
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,559
Insult them until their necks almost break.
We can't avoid them, no matter what.

169
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,360
If we can't avoid them,

170
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
we have to fight, right?
Why be afraid of them?

171
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,840
We're more beautiful, richer, and more powerful, right?
Isn't that right!?!?

172
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,759
Yeah, exactly!

173
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,720
What are we going to do
about those troublemakers?

174
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,759
There's not much we can do.
We have to study in the same class as them.

175
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:52,279
Just seeing their faces makes me angry.

176
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,240
Always fortune-telling for others
but forgetting to fortune-tell for themselves.

177
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,320
They don't know what kind of trouble
they're going to encounter.

178
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:07,120
So, we have to endure
studying with them every day, huh?

179
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,360
It's so annoying,
it's enough to drive you crazy.

180
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,759
Those guys are okay,
but their mouths are annoying.

181
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,000
They create irritation every day.

182
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,440
I think they're air pollutants.

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, A, May, Bell.
Just hearing their names makes my stomach turn.

184
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,639
Oh my god, what sin have we committed?

185
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,799
Oh my god!

186
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,320
If I'm a ladyboy like them, facing old age.

187
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,000
I quit, really, becoming a real man, my friend!!!

188
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,360
Headache having to
see those three eunuchs' faces in the classroom.

189
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,679
Annoying, those old gray ladyboys.

190
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,919
But we put on makeup.

191
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,919
You, yeah, my face is already beautiful.

192
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,840
Our gang is the best.

193
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,759
Of course, it's already here.

194
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,919
Especially me.

195
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,720
What's this? Look in the mirror.

196
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,320
Are you jealous?

197
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Let me daydream a bit.

198
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,320
Sorry, ma'am.

199
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Let me fantasize a little.

200
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,279
New,

201
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,559
let's talk for a moment.
Where are you headed?

202
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,120
I actually going to find the student affairs teacher.
Anything you need?

203
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,559
Nothing much.

204
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,080
We just wanted to chat.

205
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,559
We saw you're new here,

206
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,240
so we thought we'd introduce you
to some things we do around here.

207
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,279
Sure, I'm glad to help if there's anything.

208
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,440
I'm happy to meet you guys.

209
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,919
Thanks a lot.

210
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,039
Then you go find the teacher first.
We'll catch up later.

211
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,879
Okay, see you in the classroom.

212
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,919
Yep.

213
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,159
So, do you think like me?

214
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,519
I think so.
We need to get New to join our group.

215
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,279
She's our only hope.

216
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,559
If she joins us,

217
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:50,879
we'll shine brighter
and have more opportunities.

218
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,840
Absolutely.

219
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,480
She's new and seems nice.

220
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,080
She must be able to help us in some way.

221
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,919
Then newcomers like us will stand out.

222
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,840
Excellence exists.

223
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,960
Hey,

224
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,559
why did they call Yut, Nut, and Parn
"The Beautiful Trio"?

225
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,919
Because they're beautiful?

226
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,399
Nah,

227
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,039
it's because they weigh a hundred each.

228
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,679
They each weigh a hundred,

229
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,720
so they're called "The Beautiful Trio".

230
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,279
Oh, and what about Olive,

231
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,919
Bell, A, May?
Why do they call each other that?

232
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,399
Because they're skinny like Olive.

233
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,360
They're skinny as a skeleton.
So they call themselves that. Have you seen?

234
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Yeah, it seems so true.

235
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,360
I've seen it. It's hilarious.

236
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,480
And what about the newcomers, Pat and So?

237
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,399
Why do they call these two the "Dynamic Duo"?

238
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,080
I think

239
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,120
these two must have come
from the Himalayan forests for sure.

240
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,159
Look at their faces. It's obvious.

241
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:10,000
Exactly. Gossiping about friends like this isn't good.

242
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,839
Too bad, huh? This term,
we're not in the same class as 4/13,

243
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,519
otherwise, it would've been fun to watch.

244
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,160
I guarantee it would've been fun,

245
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,039
hilarious, and chaotic for sure.

246
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,000
Hilarious, and chaotic for sure.

247
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,039
It's a shame we didn't draw lots together.

248
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,319
We have to study with those dorks,
Jet, Go and Mit.

249
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,400
Those twin devils with Big &amp; Nic.
New, and Mac too.

250
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,599
What a pity.

251
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,480
But our 4/1 has its own oddball coming.

252
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,039
Here's the little oddball.

253
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,920
Oh, she must be the new tough girl of this school.

254
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,160
In grade 3 last year, she was still a boy.

255
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,200
How did she become a girl in grade 10?

256
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,599
From being a dude to becoming this,
she's fully transformed.

257
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,759
We'll keep an eye on her behavior
better than anyone else.

258
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,359
It'll be as fun
as watching three gangs, 4/13, for sure.

259
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,400
Let go to class, everyone. It's time.

260
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,960
Where are you off to, New?

261
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,880
I'm going to meet the student affairs teacher.

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
And you, Jet?

263
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,119
Just waiting to meet you.

264
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,359
Why wait? We were together in class just now.
We meet every day, don't we?

265
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,200
It's not the same.
There are other people around.

266
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,480
Other people? They're all our friends.

267
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Sometimes I just want to be with you alone.

268
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,839
Having others around changes things.

269
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,599
Hmm.

270
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,519
Are you trying to tease us again?

271
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,559
Ever since Grade 9,
you've always enjoyed teasing us.

272
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,359
Well,

273
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,480
I've wanted to study with you for a long time.

274
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,240
From Grade 7 to Grade 9,
we never got to study together.

275
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,440
Finally, this year I'm content.

276
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,519
Well then, shall we go meet the teacher together?

277
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,079
Sure. Let's go.

278
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,279
But we should only go up to the classroom door

279
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,680
because we're meeting with the other guys later.

280
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,799
Okay then, let's go.

281
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,400
What am I going to do?

282
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,680
There's no LGBTQ+ group for me to join.
No one wants to include me.

283
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,400
In the same class, no one accepts me.

284
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
Other classrooms won't accept me either.

285
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,599
4/13 doesn't want me either.

286
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,519
Hello!!!

287
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,039
Can I join your group?

288
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,839
Oh my, what's this?

289
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,279
Let me tell you, to join our group,
there are many factors to consider.

290
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,759
Yes indeed. Your beauty, your intelligence.

291
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,559
You don't qualify.

292
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,519
And another thing,

293
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,279
financial stability is necessary.

294
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,359
But from my observation,

295
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,720
you seem to belong in the ordinary class.

296
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,799
You don't make the cut.

297
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,720
And what about your ghost-like appearance?

298
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,599
I think you need a makeover.

299
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,200
Come back when you're as pretty as us.

300
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,599
Then, maybe you can join.

301
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,880
And where am I not pretty?

302
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,559
Everywhere!!!

303
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm so pretty!

304
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,640
I can't help! So rude!

305
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,559
Rude! Let's go, everyone.

306
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,319
Cheers!

307
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,319
What's this?

308
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,799
These three are really mean.
They enjoy looking down on others as if it's true.

309
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,920
Oh my, so rude! So rude! I'm beautiful too!

310
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
Hello!!!

311
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,880
Can I join your group?

312
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,759
What's with you, Jeedny?

313
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,480
Sorry, that your class doesn't have any gays
or transgenders to keep you company?

314
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,400
There's none, really.
So, I'd like to join your group.

315
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,799
We're not comfortable with it.

316
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,319
We don't like faces like men's.

317
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,920
Go find another group.

318
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,039
And how did you come to be a transvestite?
Not just in appearance,

319
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,279
but in heart too.

320
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,480
I wonder if you hold the belief that

321
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,680
"curry" and "kathoey" can be obtained
without having to wait!

322
00:22:56,476 --> 00:23:09,759
Go back to being a man.
Don't let the LGBTQ+ community corrupt and suffer.

323
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:19,640
We surrender.
May you find a group of stars soon.

324
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,279
Oh, keep what my friend said in mind.

325
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,680
Or go back to being a man.

326
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,039
It might make your life easier.
Since the beginning of puberty,

327
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,880
you've been unfit for our group.

328
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,319
Listen,

329
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,319
the way you are,

330
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,400
it's not suitable to be in our gang.

331
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,799
You shouldn't be LGBTQ+.

332
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,920
Go back to being a guy.

333
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,880
I thought you guys would be nice.

334
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,000
Where can you get that idea? Argh!
No different from the hellish Olive group.

335
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,680
What's up, Jeedny?

336
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,359
Yeah, that's Jeedny right there.
She's coming over.

337
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,000
Someone's talking about her, she's coming.

338
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,799
I think we should include her in our group.

339
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Oh, no!

340
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,519
We can't let Jeedny join our group.

341
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,359
She'll ruin our image.
This is her attempt to lower our group's status.

342
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,240
The two of us might have to lower ourselves
until we can't rise up again.

343
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,319
That's true about you, Pattharaporn.

344
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,799
From situation, her look really low.

345
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,960
I've been thinking about something of mine too.

346
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,720
At the beginning of high school,
I heard she was a boy.

347
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,440
When she introduced herself in Grade 9,

348
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,960
she was just as she appears now.

349
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,559
She's increased the transgender population
by one more person,

350
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,039
all by herself.

351
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,000
Grand opening has been widely advertised.

352
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,160
Both of you are so mean! Ugh!

353
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,400
Even the group of rejects
like the couple Nareephol Gang,

354
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,960
New Kids /13, that's not pretty,

355
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,319
not outstanding,
they still won't let me join the group.

356
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:21,039
Okay,

357
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,240
I'll show you. I'll shine on my own,
and everyone will see.

358
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,279
And you guys, pretty and transgender alike,

359
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,759
will regret not letting me join the group.
I'll show you!

360
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
Hey, everyone, I have good news to share.

361
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,559
What good news, I'm beautiful!!!

362
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,119
The good news is that the teacher
might cancel the afternoon class.

363
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,839
We can escape school
and go shopping for makeup!

364
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,720
Great!

365
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,119
I can buy some beautiful clothes too.
Where's my wallet? Where are my shoes?

366
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,759
You guys are hopeless.

367
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,920
If you're lazy to study like this,
you might as well just quit.

368
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,119
Absolutely.

369
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:23,279
You'll see,
the kids don't pay attention to studying;

370
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,920
they're busy doing makeup and hair.

371
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,599
Sometimes, they're just shopping
without any purpose.

372
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,119
Not only that,

373
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,400
they are beautiful too.

374
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,039
Miss Taipei and Miss Peru, and paying for men
to the utmost level. [*Homophonic jokes about "pay"]

375
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,480
So, what's the plan,

376
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,200
my rich and outstanding friends?

377
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm rich, I'm outstanding, and I'm beautiful.

378
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,160
And why would we do that, huh?

379
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,960
We're not as brainless as you.
I may be rich, I may be outstanding,

380
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,680
but I'm not showing off. I can study or not study;
it doesn't bother anyone.

381
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,480
That's right.

382
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,599
No need to pity our poor family.

383
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:23,799
Probably sending a message to our parents
will be more difficult.

384
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:27,799
Hey, this is playing hard on us.

385
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,160
Who's talking about our parents first?

386
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
Really though.

387
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
Ewewewewewew!

388
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,680
Oh my God! It's melting.

389
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:02,720
This is the good news I want to tell you all.
Our new teacher!

390
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,920
I want to study so much!

391
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,240
Me too!

392
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,000
It's so beautiful;
you guys are such an inspiration.

393
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,640
Should I send the teacher back home?

394
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,359
I might be wrong,

395
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,440
but having such an attractive teacher
is probably distracting.

396
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,359
It's the symptoms of falling in love,
love at first sight. It's like this.

397
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm melting. I want to study quickly.

398
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,640
But we saw him first!!!

399
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,960
Teacher Pei is my property!!!!

400
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,720
Oh my gosh, look at your own face!!

401
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,200
I already know.

402
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,759
I will shine,

403
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,160
and I will take revenge on those Lgbtq+,
who didn't let me join their group.

404
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm beautifuleeee!!!

405
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,960
Hello, everyone.

406
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,079
I'm Pei, the new teacher at this school.

407
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,119
H... Hello.

408
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,559
I'm Yod. I teach mathematics.

409
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,039
Hello. I'm Dej. I teach health education.

410
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,240
Maybe we can teach together.

411
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,799
Nice to meet you all.

412
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,319
I'm new here, so if you have any recommendations
for me, please let me know.

413
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,079
It's a pleasure.
If you need any help, just let us know.

414
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,240
Absolutely.

415
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,039
Whether it's work-related or personal...

416
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,200
Let's talk later then. I need to go say hi
and report to the principal first.

417
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,839
Please, go ahead. Let's talk later.

418
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,400
See you later.

419
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,119
Why is our new teacher so handsome?

420
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:07,880
Oh, Teacher Yod,

421
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,680
you've seen him and your legs are trembling.

422
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,599
Oh, Teacher Dej,

423
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:13,640
you're quite reserved too. But don't worry,
I'll show off my feelings to let him know I like him.

424
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
You're very reserved too.
Later on, Teacher Yod,

425
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,039
if you like someone, show it off so they know.

426
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,319
Let's invite Teacher Pei to have a meal together.

427
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,240
I want to entertain Teacher Pei.

428
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,559
Is that so? Is that so?

429
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,000
You're making me really hungry now.

430
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,119
Even I, a strong teacher, am trembling.

431
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,200
Counting on what and against
whom with the students of this school.

432
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,680
Look at you all!
The new teachers are quite attractive.

433
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,400
Absolutely!

434
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,559
A hot specification indeed.

435
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:51,880
But I sense that Teacher Yodnapa
and Teacher Detsuda  are eyeing our PE teacher.

436
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,279
They might devour her whole.

437
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,119
I also noticed you, Mr. Handsome.

438
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,680
Both of them will probably
do everything to have a taste.

439
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,440
Speaking of it makes me feel a bit envious.

440
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,119
Putting on makeup for Teacher Yodnapa
and Teacher Detsuda, 999,999 times.

441
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,680
No way, not like this.

442
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,200
Earlier,

443
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
she gathered a team
to flirt with male teachers in school.

444
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,880
Staff from various departments, school security,
everyone had to come.

445
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,319
She was aggressive in hitting on them.

446
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,119
She must be serious about it.

447
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,000
Besides, when she teaches us, she's strict.

448
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,799
A bit crazy but comes out as a sly fox.
Seen her and can't help but laugh.

449
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,880
Those kind of girls, sitting or standing indifferently,

450
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,640
the helicopter is hovering in the sky.

451
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,799
Look down, and you'll know she's a fox. Hilarious!

452
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,160
Oh my, the audacity to tease our teachers.

453
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,119
So mischievous, these students
are quite the charmers.

454
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,359
"We want to dress in school uniforms
according to our chosen gender identity"

455
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:18,720
"We want to dress in school uniforms
according to our chosen gender identity"

456
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,599
"We want to dress in school uniforms
according to our chosen gender identity"

457
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:45,359
"We want to dress in school uniforms
according to our chosen gender identity"

458
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,720
Hello, everyone around the world!

459
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,279
Here comes Jeedny!
