1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,000
What's up?

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,070
What's up?

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,320
Good movies.

4
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,710
Hey!!!

5
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,870
What's up boss? It was quiet last night.

6
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,560
Why was it quiet last night?

7
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,750
Well, Pete, I called several times,
but you didn't answer, so I went to bed.

8
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,190
I was reading a book.

9
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,560
What were you reading?
Getting tired wrists?

10
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,360
Hey, Hahaha!!!

11
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,630
What are you tired of?

12
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,750
Are you really making Pete do that?

13
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,870
That's the trick!

14
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,310
Hahaha!!!

15
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,590
Haha! Your Highness...

16
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,280
What's going on?
What are they talking about?

17
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,240
Porn movies.

18
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,280
Whoa! Guys or girls?

19
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,630
That’s you all.

20
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:11,360
So, who do you think is the biggest in the room?
I think it's not necessarily qualified, but look at the body size.

21
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,800
Whoa, I think like you.

22
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:24,720
Excuse me, but I think it's not always certain.
It's not something that can be measured by body size.

23
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:34,270
Then how do we know which guy is the biggest in the room?
Should we sneak a peek at each one of them, huh?

24
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,720
Not good at all.

25
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,680
When should we go?

26
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,830
How about going now?
Or wait for the right opportunity.

27
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,040
I want to know right now.
What should we do? I want to know so much!

28
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,120
Yes, yes. I want to know so much!

29
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
So, how do we know which guy has the biggest genitalia?

30
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Let's just have a look, shall we, ladies?

31
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,830
Is it crazy or what, Isabella?
Just let it be easy to see.

32
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,630
Hehehe.

33
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,870
Spending money like this. Hehehe.

34
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,920
Well, you can buy anything with money in this world.

35
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,600
I heard that we should look at the toe, look at the nose size.

36
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,360
Or measure the length from the middle finger to the wrist.

37
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,600
And does this theory really work, dear friends?

38
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,750
Let's try measuring the guys. Hahaha.

39
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,720
Or should we measure ourselves first? Ahh!

40
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,120
But I really want to know which guy in the room is the biggest.

41
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,510
I cheer for the head of the room.
Someone mentioned 9 inches.

42
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,510
Wow, Pete 9 inches, huh, sir?

43
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:07,680
Does the size of other organs in the body tell the size of a man's genitalia, really!?

44
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:16,190
Maybe we need to find some knowledge about this.
Let's try searching in this library first, shall we? To see if it's true or not.

45
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:24,390
Isn't it pointless?
Why do we have to take the good side of male genitalia with us?

46
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,040
Pointless? Where?
We can take the good side of this, you know?

47
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,270
The good side, penis (mumbling). Here.

48
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,040
And you don't like it? Penis (mumbling), huh?

49
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,430
I do.

50
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,560
If you like it, then we should search for knowledge right away.

51
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,070
Got it.

52
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
New!

53
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,870
Oh!

54
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,190
What's up?

55
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,630
Hey, this is...

56
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,870
What book do you want to read, New?

57
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,920
Thank you so much, Jet.
I've been wanting it for a long time.

58
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,430
Do you like it?

59
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,680
Did you buy it?

60
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,870
Nope, we have it at home.
Read it whenever you finish, then you can return it to me.

61
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,560
Thank you so much, Jet.

62
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Oops! How do you guys walk?
You knocked someone else down.

63
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,270
Who told you to stand in the middle of the walkway, villagers?

64
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,030
Oh my, Barbara! We're all hurt now.

65
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,750
Wait a minute. You guys walked into me yourselves.
Instead of grumbling, you guys should apologize to me.

66
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,150
Does your home not teach you manners?

67
00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:00,550
And who told you to stand in the middle of the walkway?
I'm pretty sure your home doesn't teach manners either!

68
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,910
And I only have manners with the right people,
not with extraterrestrial beings like you.

69
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:13,670
Hmm, and you guys still think you're pretty.
If there were no mirrors at home, no basins to wash and look at yourselves,

70
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,960
would you still think you're prettier than others?
You think too much on your own, completely delusional.

71
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,840
Hey, hey, Barbara! It's better if you don't talk like that.
Fine!

72
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:29,360
No, May!!! Don't let our clean hands touch her.
We might catch Barbara's bacteria from her.  Let them laugh at her throughout the school.

73
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,480
It's unbearable. This is not okay at all. Screw her.

74
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,720
Heard that?
We better leave now. She's waiting.

75
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,030
Shut her mouth up, 999 times. Let's go, Bell!

76
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,360
See you later, extraterrestrial. Goodbye!

77
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,790
Scum!!!

78
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:55,270
Don't think I'm scared of you guys, you sinners.
Screw you. I'm beautiful!

79
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:31,150
Ouch! I wish I had an equally cute twin like this, but hmm,
I'd rather have a twin with the same shape and appearance.

80
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:39,000
Twin? A face like a dragon of Mulan.
Are you going to have a twin to help you reign over lions?

81
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Dragon of Mulan!!!

82
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,080
Oops, calm down, don't get worked up.

83
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,240
Dragon of Mulan?
What does that even mean?

84
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,910
Wow, it's a dragon in the story of the Mulan.
You've never seen it before? Oh my.

85
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,670
This is the dragon of Mulan, really cool, huh?

86
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,600
Let's see.

87
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,870
Argh, argh, argh, argh!

88
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,270
Stop it, Belle. Give me back my phone right now.

89
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,080
A and them left for home earlier
because they're rushing back to practice Blackpink's new dance moves.

90
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Yeah, I saw her practicing dance moves all day.
It'd be better for her to leave and become a dancer.

91
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:48,120
She's obsessed with it, isn't she?
Let's go to her house and help her practice.

92
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Oh no,
I'm going home to help my mom with chores tonight.

93
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,630
True,
helping mom and getting some extra treats would be better, huh, Bell?"

94
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,840
Yeah, that's right.

95
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,720
Don't even bother. When you guys go home, you don't help with anything anyway.
You probably just scroll through Facebook, stalking guys on social media.

96
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
Well, if I don't go home, I'll be scrolling through anyway.

97
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,870
Mean!

98
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,480
As for me, I don't scroll through Facebook.

99
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:21,080
I check out the school area and on the way back home.
Yesterday, there was this guy who smiled at me. So handsome.

100
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:31,240
Oh, useless people.
Always doing nothing. Absolutely pointless.

101
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,510
You should go back and read some decent books instead.
So you won't be stupid.

102
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,120
Really, huh?

103
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,390
Damn.

104
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:45,630
Oh, stop it, you guys.
Go home and clean yourselves up first.

105
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,720
These two aliens are standing in the way.

106
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,150
Yes, they're standing like a blockade.
Don't know what they're doing.

107
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,630
Oh my, you fatty.

108
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,000
Who are you calling fat?
Can't talk, huh?

109
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Oh, so there's no mirror at home?
Should I buy one for you?

110
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,440
Don't bother with these idiots.
Let's go home.

111
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,150
Let's go.

112
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:19,600
Let's go, and be careful not to stumble.

113
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,910
Hey, you guys.
That's Frank and Tiw, from class 4/1.

114
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,200
What's up?

115
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,320
I don't know. Let's go first.

116
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,910
Is she really serious?

117
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,120
At least we won't be eating each other, right?

118
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:52,480
You guys look so cute together.
Looks like a gay drama series.

119
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:01,750
Oh, Parn, you can stop being sarcastic now.
No, those two can't be. I'll go complain to Nuht.

120
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm sure Nat will mouse for sure.
She's already bought snacks for us in front of the school. Let's go.

121
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,080
If they're a couple,
we won't be able to do anything about it, right?

122
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Right.

123
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,550
Oh, annoying.
Why haven't those guys gone back yet?

124
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,480
Oh, just go back.
Why do you keep standing here talking nonsense?

125
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,670
It stinks!!

126
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:33,960
Let's go, So.
The air around here isn't good. PM 2.5 is high.

127
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,870
Let's go. Otherwise, we'll be splashed with water.
Let's go, back to the hole.

128
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:44,000
Uh, they've all gone.
Well, why don't we go back together?

129
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Well then, what are you still doing here?
Let's go back.

130
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,790
Down we go!

131
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,320
Are you guys all on the field already?

132
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,750
Why didn't you wait for each other?
Okay, see you later.

133
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,960
Hello, Teacher Yod. Teacher Dej.

134
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,390
Hello.

135
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,720
Oh, ow, it hurts!!!

136
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
Oh, what happened, Teacher Pei!?

137
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,600
What's wrong?
Why are you making that face and sound?

138
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, I accidentally got scratched by my own little brother.
Oh, it hurts.

139
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Where is it?

140
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,750
Let me help you get it out.

141
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,200
Let me do it. I'll help you.

142
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,080
Let me help you.

143
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,120
Let me help you better.

144
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,030
Oh, it's okay. I'll handle it myself.

145
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,360
Don't be shy.
Let us help you.

146
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,110
It's amazing.

147
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,030
Let us help you.

148
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,240
Open the door and let us help you. Wow.

149
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,750
We're all men here. No need to be embarrassed.

150
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,640
Let us help you.

151
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,790
What are you listening to?

152
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,440
Oh, New..

153
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,110
What are you listening to?
I called you but didn't hear anything.

154
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,510
Oh really... Are you listening to music?
Are you?

155
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,510
Huh?

156
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,920
Oh, look who's still single.

157
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Oh, yeah. Why haven't you gone home yet?

158
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,070
Is this another gay couple from our school?

159
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,750
Look at them, enjoying their music together.
I'm so jealous, Pat.

160
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,030
Jealousy is real, huh?

161
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,880
Resentment is real!

162
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,680
Jealousy and resentment are real!!!

163
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:42,110
When will our fashion show be loud?
Why do some clips not show our faces? Why are the views and likes so high?

164
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:47,960
You think too much.
Maybe it's because only Bell's face is shown, so fewer people watch.

165
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:57,070
Well, both of our faces are beautiful.
Viewers, especially men, get very emotional when they see us.

166
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,960
Oh, it's obvious.

167
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,750
But what's obvious about it?

168
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:10,880
Nothing. By "obvious," I mean seeing both of our faces makes people angry,
which leads to more engagement.

169
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,200
Oh, Argh! Argh!

170
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:24,200
But how should we shoot together? It's better to bring out the camera and shoot.
This scene must show all three of us. Seeing only one of us isn't acceptable!

171
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:32,030
We are Miss Grand Thailand, The One and Only.
We have to shine the most.

172
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:41,030
Wait a minute!
We are Miss Universe Thailand!!!

173
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,720
You guys can't claim to be number one alone.

174
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,640
Who appointed you guys?!

175
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,510
They see us everywhere.
Look at our work!

176
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:01,160
The stage is ours, and we've been here longer than you.

177
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,480
Don't be so sure that you're number one.

178
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,110
Shut up!!!

179
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,590
Oh, stop both stages!

180
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:25,030
We are Miss Thailand. This stage has been here long before both of you.
So, being number one like this is not possible.

181
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,030
Sure!!!

182
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,440
Your faces are ancient like that stage.

183
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:39,790
Let them bite each other like this. I will shine alone.
Besides, I have to be the most fabulous in this school.

184
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:45,510
I'll also have to be famous online.
No matter which app, it has to mention me.

185
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,310
I'll be the most famous!

186
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:04,030
Even the beautiful ladyboys at home are like this. Fighting to be the ultimate winner.
It depends on people's preferences.

187
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:12,270
Have you forgotten that we're being criticized and claimed?
All of Thailand's stages.

188
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,550
As fans of beauty, you guys should be proud of every stage of Thai people.
There's no room for not loving each other!!!

189
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,200
Oh, Argh! Argh! Argh! Argh!

190
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,720
Did you get it? When will be good for you?

191
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,400
Okay, I'll go pick it up.

192
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,110
Um, okay, then I'll call you later. Bye...

193
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,030
Oh, New, how long have you been here?

194
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,070
Um, uh, New brought back the book.

195
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,440
Did you read it? How was it?

196
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,270
It was good, I liked it.. Thank you.

197
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,830
That's good.

198
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,790
I'll go into the room first.

199
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,830
Um, okay, see you in the classroom then.

200
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:45,920
Normally, I don't see you wearing makeup this thick.

201
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,720
I don't know, hehe.

202
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,920
What's up with you? Tell me something.

203
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,070
Nothing much.. Just hoping to get the attention of guys, you know.

204
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,030
Which guys? Do tell!

205
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,200
The guys on the bus, uh, it's embarrassing.

206
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,550
Geez, just passing by, what could they possibly think of you?

207
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:16,030
But he's been really nice to me. He always offers me his seat

208
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,070
Sometimes I just want to be with you alone.

209
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,270
Having others around changes things.

210
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,400
I've wanted to study with you for a long time.

211
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,590
Finally, this year I'm content.

212
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,160
and today he even started a conversation with me.

213
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,310
Really? How many times have you guys met?

214
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,830
Three times...

215
00:25:48,830 --> 00:26:01,030
Ah, chubby, there are plenty of cheeky guys out there.
Do you know who else he's doing this to?

216
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,550
No!! I don't know. Just let me daydream a little, okay?

217
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,480
I just want to keep you grounded, that's all.

218
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
Uh, okay.

219
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,480
You look pretty, by the way.

220
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,790
New!

221
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,310
Where are you going?

222
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,750
I'm going home.

223
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,030
Oh...

224
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,240
Do you usually go home right after school?

225
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,270
Um.

226
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,160
I'll go home first, my mom is coming to pick me up.

227
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,920
Oh, okay. Bye bye.

228
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,350
We're going first, guys. Got some errands to run.

229
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,070
Oh, okay.

230
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,110
Bye, guys. Have a safe trip back.

231
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Oh, why didn't we go to the courtyard?

232
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,880
Oops, sorry.

233
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,680
Forgot your glasses. How can you see like this?

234
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,790
It's okay, Jet. I'll go wash my eyes.

235
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,240
Forgot your glasses! Hurry up!

236
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,790
Stay still.

237
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,110
How's that? Better?

238
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,830
Um.

239
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,350
Hi there,

240
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,480
I'm about to leave. Okay, bye.

241
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,880
Did someone pick you up at home?

242
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,200
Um, yeah...

243
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,160
Then let's go back together. All done.

244
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,550
Let's go back together then.

245
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,000
Doing chores at home, just got calls non-stop. Haha.

246
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,160
Yeah, sounds boring. Haha.
So, where are you going next?

247
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,680
I'm going to the bookstore. Wanna come?

248
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,960
Is there something wrong? Who called?

249
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,070
Hi there... What's up? I'm at school... about to head back... Yeah... Everything's fine... Um... Okay... Yep... Bye.

250
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,270
Hi there... What's up? I'm at school...

251
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:03,680
about to head back...

252
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,070
Yeah... Everything's fine...

253
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:13,550
Um... Okay... Yep... Bye.

254
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:22,160
We're not going to the bookstore anymore.
Let's just go home instead.
