1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,870
"We want to dress in school uniforms according to our chosen gender identity"

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,160
"We want to dress in school uniforms according to our chosen gender identity"

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,030
"We want to dress in school uniforms according to our chosen gender identity"

4
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:41,790
"We want to dress in school uniforms according to our chosen gender identity"

5
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,150
Hello, everyone around the world!

6
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,710
Here comes Jeedny!

7
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,710
Wow, look at her! So bold to dress up for school. The ultimate Barbie!

8
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,590
How did she get through the school gate like this?

9
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,510
Absolutely fabulous! She's got the whole package!

10
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,400
I think she must have brought a change of clothes to switch at school. So daring!

11
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,000
She was running to join our group just yesterday, and now this? What's happening here?

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,950
That's it! This is worse than I thought.
Look at that fierce expression; it's asking for a smack!

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,510
Excuse me, but facing this, it's useless to challenge us.

14
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,640
No matter what she does, she won't outshine us.

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,710
Wait until next time; I'll dress up and compete against her.
I guarantee I'll be way prettier!

16
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,310
Today, Jeedny really stole the scene for sure. Gotta hand it to her.

17
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,750
It seems like she won't stop at this point. It's more mischievous than I thought.

18
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,000
Have you guys ever seen a sperm whale?

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,360
Heard they can run. How about it?

20
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,520
Dunno, man. I've never seen a sperm whale.
I've seen what they depend on, though.

21
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,240
See it every day. Play with it every day.

22
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,910
Some days, you see it more than three times.

23
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,710
Oh, my. That's quite a revelation, Go.

24
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,120
What are you talking about? We're embarrassed, you know?

25
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,190
What's there to be embarrassed about?

26
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,470
Where's the embarrassment?

27
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,910
I feel embarrassed just thinking about when the guys in the room do things like you, Go.

28
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,150
I feel embarrassed.

29
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,680
Oh, your imagination is so wide. What a scene! How about you?

30
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,030
The daydreaming of the chubby ladyboy is real.

31
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, girls, it's a natural thing like this.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,920
But, Mac, do they really produce sperm?

33
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,720
Hey, Go, you don't have to tell everything.

34
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,270
You're really overwhelming.

35
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,750
Don't worry, guys. We've learned from the real thing, biology, right?

36
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,240
So, are we going to use real sperm for studying?

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,950
Sure!

38
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,040
Where are you going to get the sperm?
Don't say you're going to use an example from someone in the room,

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,480
like the older guys said. Hey, it's true?

40
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,040
If it's true, we should use a lottery system then.

41
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,630
Hey, really?

42
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,160
Are you the class leader? Can we take your stuff?

43
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,920
Yeah, we'll take your stuff.

44
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,950
How do we do this? This doesn't seem fair.

45
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,190
May I? I'll take Go's stuff.

46
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,190
Heard that you take it out every day, is it true?

47
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,040
Yeah, what about it, Go?

48
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,190
Oh, that day, I probably wasn't in the mood. I couldn't handle it.

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Can we help you, Go?

50
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,950
Oh, the force is strong, Pat!!!

51
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,950
Both force and charm.

52
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,310
That's the best.

53
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,870
Real charm does exist!

54
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,000
We think we've had a fair lottery, but everyone in the room has to participate.

55
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,510
And what about the girls? Will you accept this?

56
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,800
So, to sum it up, the guys will draw lots, and the girls don't have to. Is that okay?

57
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,950
So, if it comes to that day, the guys have to draw lots. Everyone okay with this?

58
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,950
Wow, awesome!

59
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,600
Really looking forward to seeing who'll be the lucky guy
to represent us for the practical biology class.

60
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,190
What are you up to, Jeedny?

61
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,870
Oh, startled me!

62
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,390
Just passing by, heard some chit-chat from room 13.

63
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,510
Well, not exactly eavesdropping, just happened to hear it casually.

64
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,000
And coincidentally heard what exactly, bro?

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,070
Well, all the 10th-grade rooms will have a representative for the practical biology class.
I propose myself for the job.

66
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,480
Seriously?

67
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,510
Yeah, true. I've been quietly listening in for a while.

68
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,270
Oh, not eavesdropping, just casually listening.

69
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,360
Oh, not eavesdropping, just casually listening.

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,800
I think it has to be you, looking all diligent and stuff.

71
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,950
Alright, we'll give up our rights. You go for it, Frank.

72
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,950
Why me? Why does it have to be me?

73
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,430
Oh, no need to argue or struggle.

74
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:38,560
On that day, whoever it is,
Jeedni will gladly volunteer to scrub and iron the uniform for them.

75
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Jeedny! It’s really scary!

76
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
Why should anything be scary?
Can't you see how beautiful I am?

77
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,310
Look closely, please.

78
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,560
So, you're dressed up for class, huh? Alright,

79
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,270
looking good!

80
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:07,310
We'll excuse ourselves, Jeedny, as we're heading to the restroom.

81
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,920
Alright, see you later, Jeedny!

82
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,600
I am the epitome of beauty in this world.

83
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,430
Hello, I'm Jeedny! Hahaha

84
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
Oh, I'm right here. Stop laughing, kids.

85
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:39,600
Stop and go change into the standard school uniform.
Hurry up before I have to call your parents to meet.

86
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,720
Why can't I dress like this, Teacher Mo?

87
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,360
No matter how I dress, I can still study the same.

88
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
You shouldn't have to ask, dear.

89
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,510
Our school is an all-boys school.

90
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:56,870
You are a male student, and you have to dress according to the school's regulations.
No matter what gender you choose to be, you must follow the rules set by the school.

91
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,360
Our school is open about gender issues. What else do you want?

92
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,870
Look at the teacher and then look back at yourself.

93
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,630
Yes, Teacher. I won't do this again.

94
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,750
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:25,120
Maybe the principal will allow it for a week.
Students can wear wizard costumes to study for a week.

96
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,600
I doubt you'll dress like this at that time, right?

97
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,480
Really, Teacher?

98
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,840
I saw how they dressed in the assembly hall a few days ago.
Even if I'm not sure, it's a friendly gesture.

99
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,390
Isn't it? And where is your school uniform, dear?

100
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,390
It's in the locker, Teacher. I'll hurry to change.

101
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay, go ahead.

102
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,320
I'll go in to teach first. See you in Thai class, dear.

103
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,030
I'll go in to teach first. See you in Thai class, dear.

104
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,080
Demanding attention works well, huh?

105
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,670
Everyone talks about me.
Why is my rating so high? This is just the beginning.

106
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,790
I have to create a bigger wave.

107
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,270
I'm shininggggg!

108
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:48,080
That team, what's going on? I see only one human;
the rest seem to have escaped from the zoo or the jungle.

109
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,630
Those three girls, can they jump and hit the ball?

110
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,720
They must weigh over a hundred each.

111
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,840
Why not bring the guys down to play?
Stop with this volleyball; let's play something else.

112
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Ugh,

113
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,360
I can't take it anymore.

114
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,960
How about we just hit each other?
Skip the volleyball; I'm done. Let's fight!

115
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,550
Don't exchange blows.

116
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,270
These three won't be affected.

117
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,600
Whatever it is, let's compete with skills and strength, not violence.

118
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,030
True, only good at talking.

119
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,720
Every day, all I hear is complaining about others' behavior. Ugh!

120
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Well, well, these girls look fierce.
How about playing? Look at them, confident and strong.

121
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,720
Should we be a substitute team? Let's see how it goes.

122
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,750
Let's give it a try. Look and see if we can be the team to beat.

123
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,150
Even if it's not a serious competition, we won't hold back. Be ready, girls.

124
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,550
Alright, let's do it!

125
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,320
Hold on!

126
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,600
Stop with the banter and the taunting. Compete instead. Let's go and play.

127
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,790
I'm beautiful,

128
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm outstanding,

129
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm sweet.

130
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,550
However, I must win. I'm beautiful!

131
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll hit the volleyball on your face, one by one. Let's see how you react. Watch it!

132
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:27,150
Look at their evil glares and feel the shivers. Watch out, girls

133
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,600
Let's see how they feel with a powerful spike. Ready to be scared?

134
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,630
I don't want to insult or curse, but sometimes actions speak louder than words. Hit it!

135
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,000
Slap them with the volleyball. Ready, steady!

136
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,910
Anyway, we have to win. Haha!

137
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:52,670
It's like a real war, not just a volleyball game. So scary!

138
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,790
Need water?

139
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,240
Oh!

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,150
Tired, huh?

141
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,120
Are you giving it to me, Mac?

142
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,510
Yes. I'll open it for you.

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
Tired, right? Let me wipe your face.

144
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,720
Oh, refreshing, Mac.

145
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,960
Throw up!!!

146
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,960
Thanks, Mac.

147
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm really tired. Wipe here too.

148
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,870
Mac! Stop!

149
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,750
What's wrong?

150
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,390
Take this, don't forget the volleyball class in the afternoon.

151
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,910
Another 1,000?

152
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,870
Oh no, what is this for?

153
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,870
Last time, you didn't pay.

154
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,360
Oh, here.

155
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
Thanks.

156
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,080
Alright.

157
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm truly beautiful. Everyone must envy me.

158
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,150
Oh, friends, there’s a new teacher in charge!!!

159
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,630
Hello, students.

160
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,150
Hello, sir.

161
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,320
My name is Thanawat, or you can call me Teacher Pae.

162
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,550
I'm the new head of the PE department.
I'll be teaching volleyball, basketball, and swimming.

163
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,640
In the next hour, I'll have you all divide into groups for warm-up exercises.

164
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,750
Each group will have 5 members.

165
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,350
Let's get started.

166
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,750
Wait a moment, sir.

167
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,070
What's up, students?

168
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:26,310
I brought water for you, sir. My housekeeper was busy, so I had to bring it instead.

169
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,510
Thank you very much.

170
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,880
Oh, Jeedny is exhausted. My head is spinning, like there's a storm coming.

171
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,480
Everyone, warm up. I'll take her to the nurse's office.

172
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:52,160
Oh, what's this? Hey!!! Tell me what this is!

173
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,400
Oh, Jeedny is dangerously cunning, the ultimate schemer. She's a wicked person.

174
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,440
She's ready to challenge us for sure.
She's trying to take revenge on us. Talking too much!

175
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,920
Right now, I have to admit, I'm extremely annoyed.

176
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,550
Annoyed to the max. That flea is unexpectedly malicious.

177
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,720
Give it to her!

178
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,350
This is what they call 'beautiful but not afraid, afraid very fast.'
Oh, this is a clear one-man show.

179
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,160
I won't forget today's events, Jeedny.

180
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
We'll see each other well. Oh my!

181
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,400
Jeedny, Crazy person! I won't keep you in my good books.

182
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,160
She's truly wicked. What should I do? Today, I lost two rounds to her.

183
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,640
The taste of defeat is real.

184
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,880
This is just dipping sauce.

185
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,160
I'll challenge everyone now. Watch me!!!

186
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Hahaha!!!

187
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,240
Hello, Teacher Yod and Teacher Dech. Where are you heading?

188
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,720
Hi, just dropped by for breakfast.

189
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,920
Thought of Teacher Pei, so I bought some snacks.

190
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,680
Take it, enjoy. Delicious.

191
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,880
Oh, so touched. Thank you so much.

192
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:43,160
No need to be touched. We're willing and happy to do this.

193
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,160
Enjoy your meal. If you want something special, let us know.

194
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,070
Thank you very much. I'm truly grateful.

195
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,720
Good morning, teachers.

196
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,790
Wait,

197
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,960
your face looks familiar.

198
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,030
Are you a student in which class and section?

199
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm in class 4/1,

200
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:22,030
studied with you, Teacher Dej, and Teacher Yod throughout junior high school.

201
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,720
Oh, starting to remember.

202
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,790
Wow, you're Niwat right?
The top student for the past 3 years.

203
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,310
Yes, that's me. Jeedny your student.

204
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,920
The one who ranked first in the entire school for the past 3 years.

205
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,310
How did this happen? How did you change like this?

206
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:50,350
I chose to be like this. It's my happiness and dream.

207
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
I don't know why I'd keep it hidden.

208
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,440
So, are you comfortable now?

209
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes, I am. Thank you very much, Teachers,

210
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,350
for taking care of me at the nurse's office yesterday.

211
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,510
Still not well.

212
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,350
I'll take you to the nurse's office.

213
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,830
Excuse us, Teacher Yod and Teacher Dej. I'll take her to the nurse's office first.

214
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,000
Sure, go ahead.

215
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,270
This is Jeedny, the troublemaker.

216
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,440
Where did she graduate from? She stole the scene so much.

217
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,240
Encountered a student spreading cake all over her face this morning
instead of getting her face done.

218
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,960
Instead of gaining face, she lost face like that.

219
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,480
How are you, Dad?

220
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,510
The new dormitory is good. The room is spacious and quiet.

221
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,590
The school is also good.
Friends are nice, and the teachers are good. No issues here, Dad.

222
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,310
I prefer studying here, so no need to transfer to your friend's school.

223
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,830
That's all for now, Dad. Everyone has already gone downstairs.
We need to change classes.

224
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,720
I have enough money for now, Dad.

225
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,240
Thank you so much Dad.

226
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,550
Teacher,

227
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:45,310
the three of us are not good at playing volleyball.
We don't know how to use our hands.

228
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:50,310
Could you please help us by showing us how to hold hands, arms, and guide us a bit?

229
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,550
Teacher, and what about me?
How should I do it?

230
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,440
Like this, or like that, or maybe like this?

231
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,550
Alright, I'll teach you. Let me show you.

232
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,550
Please teach us.
We're not doing well. What should we do?

233
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:16,510
How should we hold hands and legs, teacher?

234
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:24,640
No, you should hold it like this and hit right here.

235
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,240
I can't hit it at all. What should I do?

236
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,200
Thank you, Teacher.

237
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,310
Okay.

238
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,720
Sorry for making you fall.

239
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,880
No need to apologize; it's our fault too.

240
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
We sneaked in a bit. Let's both apologize. We're not good at sports.

241
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,270
We'll teach you.

242
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:20,000
But we'd like to fall like this again; it's comfortable lying down like this forever.

243
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,440
Teacher,

244
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,000
how should I position my hand? And which hand should I use to hit?

245
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,110
What about me, Teacher? My knees are weak until I have no strength left.

246
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,750
Be careful, students.

247
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,720
Are you feeling okay?

248
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,160
Teacher, what kind of water would you like to drink? We'll go get it for you.

249
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,920
I'll have plain water, thank you very much.

250
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,070
Alright, we'll be right back.

251
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,070
Congratulations on this, everyone. Let's go, guys.

252
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,350
Today, we don't have to worry about anything anymore.

253
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,680
Whatever, Parn.

254
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,880
Okay, pay attention.

255
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,750
Keep this arm straight, and then hit the ball here. The ball will fall right here.

256
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,110
Is it okay like this? Try hitting it like this. Can you do it?

257
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,550
I'm here.

258
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh, my goodness.

259
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,590
Sorry, Teacher. I didn't mean to.

260
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,030
It's okay. It's okay. I'll take off my shirt, and then I'll teach.

261
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,200
You did well, Parn.

262
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,440
Today, I'll treat you to ten pieces of pork.

263
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,400
Pure joy really exists!

264
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,400
We must thank this water. It's excellent.

265
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,720
I'll give this event a full ten and another ten! Haha!

266
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,590
Today, everyone's spirits are high.

267
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,480
We have to get an A for this subject, right?

268
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,920
We'll be serious about studying, won't we?

269
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,640
So bright!

270
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,590
Stuffed steamed bun! One for you, Teacher.

271
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,590
Go on. Go study, and we'll join you.

272
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,790
Everyone, listen up!

273
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,440
Today, Teacher Dej called and said he's going to teach us how to put on a condom, and...

274
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,110
Yayyyy! Woohoo!

275
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,070
Oh no, not good, not beautiful at all.

276
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,480
Do you like it, though?

277
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Love it!

278
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,550
I'll demonstrate if you want, guys.

279
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,030
Don't want to see a chicken's leg, eww!

280
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,680
Sorry, mine's not small, you know.

281
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,920
Damn, take the biggest one!

282
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,720
Yayyyy!

283
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,510
You're the show-off here.

284
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,680
Funny! You talk too much. You're just showing off.

285
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,640
Or maybe you're not big, but your eggs are cute, huh?

286
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,640
Hey! Watch your mouth, I'm strong!

287
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,160
If it's about big things... spill it.

288
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,030
Oh, big mouth. Seeing the real deal, do you want to stay quiet now?

289
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,640
What will you do then?

290
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,000
Hey, where is everyone?
Who's going to demonstrate today?

291
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,550
Damn it! Today, I'm definitely the target.

292
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,030
Considerate indeed.

293
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,920
Alright, I'll teach the correct way to put it on first.

294
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,030
Everyone should already know why we use condoms, right?

295
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,200
In this day and age, no need for explanations.
Study it yourselves. True, right?

296
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Don't rush to learn something else. But let's go, knowing the right way is better.

297
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,720
But, Teacher, I don't know why we use it.

298
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,550
Do you want to know for personal use or to educate someone else?

299
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,920
Oh, uh, I don't know anything, Teacher.

300
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,680
Well, of course.

301
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,440
It helps prevent pregnancy and protects against sexually transmitted diseases.

302
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,640
Like you, for instance, might need it for the latter.

303
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,240
Who told you? I can get pregnant too.

304
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Deep thoughts!

305
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,830
Oh, my!

306
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,590
Alright,

307
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,720
let's start with the buying process.

308
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,000
Don't buy unknown brand condoms. Choose only those with recognized standards.
The standards may vary between brands,

309
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,880
but they should be certified by relevant government agencies in each country.
When purchasing, select from stores that store products in a cool place,

310
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,110
protected from sunlight and heat, to prevent condom deterioration.

311
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:22,550
Then, choose a condom size that fits your circumference properly,
avoiding it being too tight or too loose.

312
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,590
It's hard to find my size.

313
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,640
Small?

314
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,830
Put it on and everything is tight. Let me tell you.

315
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,720
Just jerks off, why wear it?

316
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,310
Please don’t look down on me!

317
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:48,030
Carefully tore the condom from the packet.
Be careful not to let the condom come into contact with your fingernails or sharp objects.

318
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,590
After tearing the envelope out.
You should prepare to put on a condom immediately.

319
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,680
Wear it when the penis is erect.
Gently squeeze the air out of the bulb at the end of the condom until there are no air bubbles left.

320
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:13,160
If you don't squeeze out the air bubbles.
When ejaculating sperm or having sex, this bulb can rupture.

321
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,030
Well, why not give it a try?

322
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,640
Yes, sir..

323
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,680
Hey! What are you doing?

324
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,070
I will demonstrate how to put on a condom.

325
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,720
I didn't say that the demonstration was the real thing.
I meant to demonstrate with this guy!

326
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,880
Huh! !

327
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,240
Hahahahahahaha

328
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,240
I didn't tell you to use the real thing.
It's not all said yet, let's think about it ourselves.

329
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,640
OK, are you ready?

330
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:27,680
Okay, this is the correct way. Clap your hands for your friends.

331
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,440
Hello, New!

332
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,070
Why are you standing there smiling alone in the library?

333
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,030
Oh, Jeed! Hello!

334
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,110
You seem to be in a good mood.

335
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,640
But wait, for now, you have to call me Jeedny, not just Jeed.

336
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,240
Oh, sure! No problem.

337
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,680
It's nothing much. I'm just thinking of something fun.

338
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,030
Jeedny in the library?

339
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,270
I came to find more books to read.

340
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,510
I need to maintain my title as the top student,

341
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,400
reigning champion for three consecutive years since middle school.

342
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,160
You know I'm the smartest in our class, right?

343
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,000
I know. Everyone knows that. Jeedny is really excellent in academics.

344
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,680
But I don't want everyone to only recognize me for being smart, New.

345
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,350
I want everyone to accept me for who I am right now.

346
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,480
They will eventually.

347
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,680
And Jeed, or Jeedny, just introduced yourself at the beginning of the semester.

348
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,720
People might not be used to it yet.

349
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,110
Well, New isn't bullied like me. New can speak up.

350
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,270
New knows what we face every day.

351
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:55,030
Sometimes, the guys bully me. We don't even feel anything.

352
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:00,590
It follows their group dynamics.

353
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,480
But it hurts a lot when we're singled out for bullying,

354
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:13,360
especially the Gang of 13, in the same room with New...

355
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:27,280
True, they might not be as malicious as Jeedny or others perceive.

356
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,360
Sometimes, it's just loud noises, teasing each other.
Initially, there were quarrels,

357
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,070
but it seems like they've gotten along better lately.

358
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,590
People like those eight,

359
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,230
their personalities won't change for the better, New.

360
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:55,360
It's just a clear act. The manipulation is sharp.
The well-behaved image of New,  they won't catch up.

361
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,630
Well, I’m not that well-behaved.

362
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:05,400
I’m just an ordinary person with love, anger, and jealousy.

363
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Sometimes, I’m doesn't think like everyone else.

364
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,190
Nobody is perfect, Jeedny.

365
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,030
Anyway, no matter what, You can always talk to me.

366
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,920
Okay, then let's find some books to read together.
