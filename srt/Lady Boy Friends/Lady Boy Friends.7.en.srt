1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,290
I'm sleeping here tonight, New.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,330
Jet, you're really drunk, aren't you?

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,060
New, your lips are so red.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,750
Jet!

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,280
What's wrong with Jet? Why you walking away?

6
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,900
...I'm sorry.

7
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,120
Jet!

8
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,000
You're avoiding me, why?

9
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,740
I'm not avoiding you.

10
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,370
Not avoiding me?

11
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,180
You didn't pick up when I called, and where did you go last night?

12
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,470
Why?

13
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:14,620
Why? What's wrong with you, Jet?
What does New have to do to make Jet happy?

14
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,370
Nothing... I have to go now. I have plans.

15
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:29,400
Go where!? Let's talk about it first.
How can we talk if you keep avoiding me like this?

16
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,090
Jet... New is stressed.

17
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,840
New doesn't know what's going on with Jet. Just tell New, New is very stressed.

18
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,810
New...

19
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,650
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,620
I didn't mean to... I didn't know it would happen.

21
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,630
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready to be with anyone...

22
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm not good enough, am I?

23
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,690
Jet... Do you not like me?

24
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,480
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,570
If you don't like me, why do this to me!?

26
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,830
I'm drunk.

27
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,830
Haha

28
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,630
What's so funny? Are you laughing too much?

29
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,160
You're too cute for me to accidentally forget to kiss you.

30
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,510
Jet... Do you not like me?

31
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready to be with anyone...

32
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,680
There are several people sitting together,
why only invite New?

33
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,690
I mean, I didn't mean to. I got distracted for a moment.

34
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,390
Hey, how did you get here?

35
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,300
I walked, of course.

36
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,160
Damn it! I thought you flew here.

37
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,270
So, what's up?
I invited you to eat and you said you're not hungry. What's your deal?

38
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,420
I don't know, man.
I'm just pissed off. I don't know where to go.

39
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,740
Did you have a fight with New?

40
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,190
How would you know?

41
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,690
Come on, you're always like this.
Every time you argue with girls...

42
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,070
and now with New, how are you?
Changing your ways?

43
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,010
Change my ways? What are you talking about?

44
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,450
Well, everyone knows that you two are tight.

45
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,570
Cut it out, Go!

46
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:45,480
I saw New hanging out with someone else, asking about you and that person.
Did you break New's heart? I felt really sorry when I saw that.

47
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,930
Break New's heart?
What are you talking about? It's not like that at all.

48
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,180
Really?
Damn it! Just eat your food.

49
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,040
Pete, what are you watching?

50
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,630
Oh, having fun?

51
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,660
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

52
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,330
Hey, hello!

53
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,250
Oh, what's up, New?

54
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:39,820
Oh, really? Okay, sure, sure. Don't worry, take a break.

55
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,030
What's up with you?

56
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,390
New called to ask for sick leave.

57
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,720
Why?

58
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Not feeling well, so called in sick.

59
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,770
Oh, and is it something serious?

60
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,030
He sounds exhausted, but New said resting for a day should help.

61
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,000
New...

62
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,750
Feeling better? Are you all better now?

63
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,740
Yeah, the illness is gradually subsiding.

64
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,860
Hand me the bag, would you?

65
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,620
Here you go, take it.

66
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,050
I've been annoyed lately, buddy.
I think we should go to the game shop.

67
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:28,130
Oh, come on, games all the time? How about reading a book?
It might make you smarter than others.vert you away.

68
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,460
Hey! Don't be a buzzkill.

69
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,650
Haha, let's go somewhere else then.

70
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,770
Well, who else has the opportunity to meet girls like you?
Share some with me.

71
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,890
No way, whose is what.

72
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,080
And who are you going to find?

73
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,940
I have a date with Namwan.

74
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,220
Another Namwan? Don’t trick her again.

75
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,250
Come on, what could I possibly trick her with? Let's see.

76
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,050
Are you sure?

77
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,550
Let's see, if it's not true, it's another story.

78
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,550
You just keep flowing, man, like a running fish.

79
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,700
Keep on flowing.

80
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,960
But this one is really beautiful, I have to admit. Met her before.

81
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,840
Is this the same Namwan?

82
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Nope, different ones.

83
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,650
Why do you meet so many Namwan?

84
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,120
Don't get confused.

85
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
Don't be the same as mine.

86
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,500
We're not. I'll divert you away.

87
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,370
Oops, sorry.

88
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,650
No problem, New.
Um... but you're not hurt anywhere, right?

89
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,480
Nope, and what about you and Sol?

90
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,320
It's okay, but why does New look so down? Not feeling well?

91
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,100
I'm fine. Just feeling a bit tired.

92
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,170
Alright, how about we go get some water? We'll take you there ourselves.

93
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:39,940
Sure.

94
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,670
Let's go.

95
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,030
Hey there!

96
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,890
How's it going? Um... where are you?

97
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:23,170
Got it. I'll let you know again later.

98
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,360
At that time, I didn't know if I had any plans or not. Alright, got it. What's up?

99
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,910
Just for now, okay?

100
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,220
It's too hot right now.

101
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,100
Not as much as for you.

102
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,010
Who's that?

103
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,620
A friend.

104
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,670
Really?

105
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,890
Yeah. Anything wrong?

106
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,220
Nothing.

107
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,030
Alright, then I'll go.

108
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,030
Oh no!

109
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
What's wrong?

110
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,550
Come on.

111
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,370
Come on, again it!

112
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,010
I think Aunt Gob's shop's skills are lacking.

113
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,170
I think it's delicious though.

114
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,500
Oh, forget it! Everything you eat tastes good!
Even breast milk, you still think it's delicious!

115
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,530
Hey, come on... But it really is good.

116
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,270
I also think it's delicious.

117
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,480
Delicious? You didn't buy Aunt Gob's shop!

118
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,620
Well, do you guys know which section biology is in for the exam?

119
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,500
I don't know.

120
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,940
Does that mean you know where it was last time?

121
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,820
Oh, this one...

122
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,840
Hey, Jet,

123
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,600
I haven't interrogated you yet about yesterday's incident.

124
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Who was tailing you yesterday?

125
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,150
I saw it with my own eyes!
No one told me anything. I'm telling you the truth.

126
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,550
Hey, you! What's this heavy stuff?

127
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,840
Jar? What the fuck is wrong with you? WTH!

128
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,320
Hey New, where are you going!?
We haven't finished eating yet.

129
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,790
I don't feel like eating anymore.
It's not tasty.

130
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,580
What happened?

131
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:03,120
Dragging ourselves to stand or sit amidst the wet and dry garbage here is annoying to see.

132
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:12,500
And yet, despite you being toxic garbage,
why do you still come around here, pretending to be virtuous?

133
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:21,600
Just so happens the teacher called me to discuss representing the school in a high school academic quiz competition.

134
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:31,940
The place where people like you... you... you... you... and you... never get to touch.

135
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:41,890
Hey, you came here to insult others first,
so if you get insulted back, it's fair, isn't it? Hypocrisy!!!

136
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:49,080
That's right, just pass by quietly and that's it.
No need to greet each other like this.

137
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,790
Who wants to greet you guys, you bunch of crooked-hearted people!
Low-lives!!!!

138
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:01,030
And what you're doing right now isn't called greeting, Jeedny, it's called barking.

139
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,050
Barking dog doesn't harm a dry leaf. Mouth of a dog!

140
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:14,740
You ghost! With faces like yours, they don't even call you humans!
Your spectral wraiths!

141
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,400
If we're ghosts, you'd be even more than a ghost, humanoids from another planet.

142
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:32,440
Stop your lowly actions now, and quickly remove yourself from here.
Otherwise, a thunderous roar might stick to you.

143
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,010
Please go find the teacher quickly. Go to where you belong.

144
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,830
Yes, to the place where you must be alone, a lonely garlic bulb.

145
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,240
Sending off the guest.

146
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,250
Please.

147
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,350
Who would want to breathe the same air as you guys?
I'd rather go. You stupid bastard, shoo!

148
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,700
Almost only names left, huh, Pud!

149
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,750
And this girl jumps so fast.

150
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,070
Is it good?

151
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,700
Protecting friends to the max. Awesome.

152
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,740
Almost got slapped, right?

153
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,960
Where are you, “Jet the Charmer”?

154
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,530
I'm not going anywhere, I'm right here in school.

155
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,240
Who are you hiding from?

156
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,110
What are you talking about? You're being ridiculous.

157
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,850
I saw a girl looking for you inside the school.

158
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,640
Oh, and then what?

159
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,400
You avoided her, but you should probably answer her call.
She's been calling your number all day. My phone's been buzzing non-stop.

160
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,700
I'm going crazy!

161
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,610
I won't go crazy like you do!!

162
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,810
Hey, you're avoiding her too!!!

163
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,790
No, it's annoying.

164
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,960
You've done this again, haven't you?
You're a real jerk.

165
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,420
Oh...

166
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,380
If you don't like her, don't give her false hope every time.

167
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,830
But I'm starting to lose interest.

168
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:09,380
Why? Or have you actually fallen in love with someone for real?

169
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,700
New...

170
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,980
What's up?

171
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,140
Where are you going?

172
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,850
I'm going to the library.

173
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,030
Oh, let's go together. We can read books together.

174
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,110
Which books? I don't see any.

175
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,790
Um... I'll borrow some books for you to read.

176
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,790
Are you coming or not?

177
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,980
Oh, what? Let's go read some real books.

178
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,350
Really? Then let's go. I won't go if you don't.

179
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,550
Oops, why not?

180
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,700
New, wait a moment.

181
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,960
What, Jet!

182
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:12,310
Here, I got a new facial foam. It cleans makeup and dirt in one step.

183
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:21,790
Wow, really amazing! Where did you get it?
Send it to me to try!

184
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,660
It's expensive. Just this much is enough.

185
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,920
Okay, fine.

186
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,880
Did you give me too much?

187
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,310
Oh, it got into my eyes. It stings!

188
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,810
You're really clumsy. Just open the tap.

189
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,350
Ouch! What's happening? Why isn't the water running?

190
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,440
Oh no!

191
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,880
I can't see anything. Help!

192
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,460
It stings! So annoying! Help us!

193
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,980
Are you really pretty? Are you a high-society lady?
Like, perfect complexion, huh?

194
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,900
Hahaha!

195
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,660
Yes, all events I’m the one who did it all.

196
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,440
What's going on, Jeedny?
Why are you doing this to us?

197
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,940
What have we done to you? How dare you do this to us?

198
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:15,240
And you're brave, huh? You're really daring.
You messed with us big time. Did someone provoke or support you?

199
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,570
No, I did everything myself.

200
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:25,110
So, why are you so angry and seeking revenge on us?
If you can't catch us, what else are you going to do to us?

201
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:34,700
I'm mad because none of you let me into your group and then you talk behind my back,
calling me a troublemaker, when I'm not.

202
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,680
Oh, is that how it is?
But do you think you can get back at us with this?

203
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:57,740
Yes, If we have to face danger, who will take responsibility?
We're all in the same school. We don't need to do this to each other.

204
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:17,420
I apologize to all of you. You can hit, scold, or insult me if you want. Go ahead.

205
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,290
I didn't mean to.

206
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:25,570
Don't say you didn't mean to. This isn't unintentional.
If you were serious, we wouldn't be worse off than this.

207
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,680
Who cares about what's going on? I don't. Whoever's involved, I'm out.

208
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:42,030
I don't care about your issue.
I just have to apologize for looking down on you and insulting you.

209
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:57,790
I also haven't been good to you. Let's consider it settled.
I apologize for everything I've done.

210
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:08,460
I apologize to you too, Jeedny. We're not any better than you.
We're all the same. It's just that we flaunt ourselves a bit more.

211
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,330
You're just as good as us.

212
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,480
So, I'll go wash my face now. Bye.

213
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,720
We're leaving too.

214
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,220
Let's go.

215
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,810
Then, I won't involve myself in your issue.

216
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm sorry, Jeedny.

217
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,160
Let's go, everyone. Bye Jeedny…

218
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:55,770
I just wanted to be accepted as transgender.
I just wanted someone to accept me as a friend.

219
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,680
That's all I wanted.

220
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,330
Oh, how did I fall like that?

221
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,220
Sneaky and clumsy.

222
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,660
Jeedny, what happened? Are you okay?

223
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,850
Are you hurt badly?

224
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,940
Where does it hurt exactly?

225
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:37,030
It's okay, Go. Thank you so much. If it were someone else,
they might have just left me lying here. No one would have cared about me.

226
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:48,090
It's alright, Jeedny. Normal people would help. Don't think too much about it.
So, are you hurt anywhere? Falling so hard like that, are you okay?

227
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:54,460
It's not that bad. Just a little hurt from the fall.
But I'm fine now.

228
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,750
It's not too bad, right?

229
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:03,500
Thank you again, Go.
And I'm sorry for anything inappropriate I've done before.

230
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:10,880
Don't worry about it. Just take care. It's getting late.
Your friends are waiting in front of the school.

231
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
It's okay if you're not hurt.

232
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,090
Goodbye, see you later.

233
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,090
New...

234
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,160
What's up?

235
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,030
I came to pick you up. Let's go study together.

236
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,570
Are you serious?

237
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,700
Oh,

238
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,960
New...

239
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,830
New, wait! You're not coming to study!?

240
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,940
New!

241
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,750
What's wrong, New?

242
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,160
New!

243
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,660
New, what's wrong?

244
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,140
Hey, how did you get in here?

245
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,400
I just walked in.

246
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,050
Jet! Get out now.

247
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,400
New, calm down. Jet has something to tell New.

248
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:06,960
Tell me what!? I don't want to hear anything from you anymore.
Whatever you want to do, just do it, don't bother with me!

249
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,810
I can't just stop bothering with you!!

250
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:24,790
I'm tried, tried not to look, not to care... but I couldn't do it.

251
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:35,330
It might sound funny that I say to stop, but I can't stop it.

252
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,640
Jet... don't do this. Go back.

253
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,180
New...

254
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:53,680
Is you just pitying me?
Come talk to me like this, make me feel good, and then hurt me in the end?

255
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:01,960
New... It's not like that. I don't want to hurt anyone.

256
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:15,570
Yes... I'm not good myself.
I admit it. I've been like that all along... I'm afraid to love someone.

257
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:23,010
When I was with you, those good feelings were real.

258
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:30,850
As we delved deeper... I got scared.

259
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,640
Scared that I'd get hurt if I truly loved someone.

260
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,770
So you hurt someone else instead?

261
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:48,200
New, I'm sorry... but now I know...

262
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,500
I really like you.

263
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,180
....Go back.

264
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,750
New...

265
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,980
I has a headache and wants to rest.
Go to class. You're late.

266
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:11,960
Earlier, I was being honest, New.

267
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:25,570
I doesn't know what to believe from you anymore. I’m not confident in you anymore.

268
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:31,310
I don’t want to be foolish again.
You can go back now.

269
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,250
New...

270
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,510
Jet, why are you still here?

271
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,770
Why do I have to go anywhere?

272
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,240
It's getting warmer now.

273
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,460
Hey! Get out!

274
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,270
Hey! Don't be stubborn.
If you're going to sulk, at least look at your own faults first.

275
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,480
Hey! Who's sulking?

276
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,740
If you're still feeling dizzy, don't get up yet.

277
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,720
Why bother trying to be good now? Just go back.

278
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,880
We're just concerned.

279
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,640
No need to worry about me.
I can take care of myself. Just go back.

280
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,940
Not going back.

281
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,920
Fine... if you're not going, I'll go by myself.

282
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,740
Hey! I will go.

283
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,250
New... what I said this morning... I meant it.

284
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,460
New... New!

285
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,200
Huh?

286
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,700
New, you're really hot. Let's go see a doctor.

287
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,780
Jet, you're here again?

288
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,710
What time is it now? I woke up late.

289
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,960
No need to go to school anymore.
With this condition, it's better to see a doctor. Get up quickly.

290
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,420
Why bother? It'll go away on its own.

291
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,480
Stop being stubborn. Let's go. I'll take you to the doctor.

292
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,260
Come on, quickly. Let's go see the doctor quickly.

293
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,820
Let's go. I'll support you.

294
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:56,210
What happened? Got injected with medication?

295
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,550
If you hadn't taken me, I wouldn't have had to get injected with medication!

296
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,920
Oh wow, if you didn't get the injection, you wouldn't get better.

297
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,590
Great, then I might as well die.

298
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:14,840
What are you saying? Stop acting like a child. Take care of yourself a little.
Don't you think others might worry about you?

299
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,960
No, especially not Jet.

300
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:31,840
New... I'm genuinely worried about you.
I don't know how to make you believe it, but I'll show you.
