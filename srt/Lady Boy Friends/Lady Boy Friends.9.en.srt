1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,710
Hey, Go, I have a question.
If you had to choose between a dream and a loved one, what would you choose?

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,800
Haha, I'd probably choose... the loved one.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,270
Really? Why is that?

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:23,050
I don't know. But sometimes, our loved ones might just be our dreams.
Some people spend their whole lives searching for love, it's as elusive as dreams, New.

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,870
But dreams aren't easy to find or make either.

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,070
It's true, New. It depends on the person and the timing. Why did you ask anyway?

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,840
Nothing.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,390
Hey, did you guys see anything just now?

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,890
See what?

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,320
It's Go and New, isn't it? They seem oddly close.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
Yeah, I think so too. It's like they could be twins with me.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,610
Hey!

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,280
Go... I have something to tell you.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,430
Hmm, what is it?

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,700
Yeah, I'm really interested. I've wanted to be an exchange student for a long time.
I've wanted to be a graphic designer since I was a kid.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,310
You should give it a try. I think you'd be great.

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,930
Go!

18
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,500
Huh?

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,260
Actually, I've already passed the exam.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,640
Huh? You passed the exam?

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes, I did. I'll be an exchange student soon.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,790
Yes, in two more weeks, I'll be leaving.

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,810
Two weeks!

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,870
It's happening so fast, New.

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,870
Yes, thank you.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,680
You're really talented. Congratulations.

27
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,980
Congratulations, for real.

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm happy for you, but remember, you have to make it happen.

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,980
Thank you, teacher.

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,120
You have another friend from another school who will be going on an program.

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh, where is he going?

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,590
He's going to Australia.

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,370
Oh...

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,010
You went to America, which was a great choice.
I heard you're interested in graphic design as well, right?

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,980
Oh, are you here to submit your work?

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,680
Teacher, may I have a moment first?

37
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,240
New, New, wait...

38
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,590
Why rush like that?

39
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,410
Really... So, what did you talk to the teacher about earlier?

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,190
Didn't you hear?

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,410
If I heard, would I be asking you?

42
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,680
Um... no, we talked about exam scores.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,210
Oh, is that so?

44
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,310
Yeah... Why? If I fail, would you tutor me?

45
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,680
No, I already have friends tutoring me.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,650
Oh, I see.

47
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,520
Hey, New.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,960
Hey Jeedny, what's up?

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,620
I'm happy for you, New, that you're going on an exchange program.

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,810
Thanks a lot, Jeedny.
Actually, if you were taking the exams, you'd surely pass too.

51
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:07,630
Not really. I don't want to go on exchange, New.
But if I had to go, I'd prefer to exchange in China. I like everything Chinese.

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,620
I heard that next term our school will start teaching Chinese too, Jeedny.

53
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,840
Really? That's awesome.

54
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,010
Really? That's awesome.
Maybe I'll join you then.

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,540
That'd be great.

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:28,330
It seems like the principal wants all grades to learn it.
Chinese won't just be an elective.

57
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,890
Seems like we'll have to learn Chinese like we do English then, New.

58
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,720
Exactly.

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,560
That's cool.

60
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,270
Hey, New's classmates, are you planning a farewell party for New?

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,890
I'm not sure, but if you do, make sure to invite Jeedny too.

62
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:52,120
Even better. We don't want New's party to be dull.
Let's go find something to eat together before New leaves.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,810
That sounds good.

64
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,810
Anyway, we're really happy for you, New.

65
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,330
Thanks, everyone.

66
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,420
This is bad. Will I pass the exam or not?
Some reports haven't even been submitted yet.

67
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,870
You're worried about not passing like me?

68
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,360
What should I do?

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,980
Why aren't you guys ready for the exam?

70
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:29,160
Exactly.
I've been planning to study since the last term ended, but I still haven't started.

71
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,270
Uh, and after this exam, you'll talk the same way again.

72
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,570
Haha, you guys need to find some inspiration.

73
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,330
What do you mean?

74
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,860
It's about dreams, friends.

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:47,830
Right, buddy?
Or is it about some desire to achieve something for someone? Got it?

76
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,920
For Som, buddy.

77
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,980
Oh, your matters are complicated, guys.

78
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,950
Finished the exam! Finally!

79
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,800
But damn, I need to pee. I'll be back in a sec.

80
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,040
So, everyone's heading to the restroom, huh?

81
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Only us left then.
So, what are you planning after the semester ends?

82
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,930
I wanna go on a trip.

83
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,430
Where to? Count me in.

84
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,060
Dunno, somewhere far away.

85
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,430
Out of this world?

86
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,980
And most importantly,
I want to sleep and forget all about it.

87
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,860
Well, that sounds good. But sounds lazy too.

88
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:08,270
Actually... we're going on an exchange program to the US...

89
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,600
Pete already knows, right?

90
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,570
For a year... I want to say goodbye.

91
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,360
Goodbye? Just for a year.

92
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,690
After all, you have to come back, right?

93
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,450
Congratulations, New! But just to let you know,
everyone already knows about our plans to go on an exchange program.

94
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,750
Oh, really?

95
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,650
But there's someone who doesn't know yet.
New might figure out who we're talking about.

96
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,870
I'll tell him now.

97
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,960
Take it easy, New.

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,100
Sure.

99
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:48,370
Anyway, since everyone's done with exams,
we all agreed to celebrate and treat New together. Alright, New?

100
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,630
Sounds good.

101
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah! It has to be like this, friends.
Absolutely awesome!

102
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,240
It'll be a while before New leaves home.

103
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,870
What are we waiting for? With all this waiting, Mom will hug me forever.

104
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,030
Once we're done with school, we're heading home.

105
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,370
Let's go. I'm definitely going.

106
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,580
Tonight, I'm going to party!

107
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,240
Let's get started! Isabella, you still haven't partied yet?

108
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Well, the term is ending, so we can party to the fullest
without worrying about going to school. Isn't that right, ladies?

109
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,480
Yes, indeed! I'm so pretty!

110
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,510
Party vibes are all about the attitude.

111
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,000
You've got the attitude, girl!

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,170
Husband, husband, husband.

113
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,510
Who's singing so melodically?
"Husband, husband, husband," can't tell who.

114
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:56,700
Sorry, I didn't realize the divas were here.
That's right, three beautiful ladies here.

115
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm so pretty! Smooth talk, right?

116
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,410
And what about you handsome guys? What are you up to?
Why aren't you going home to get ready for tonight's event?

117
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:15,440
Oh, we've been checking things out, preparing before the term ends.

118
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,050
Our school is pretty small. Did you find anything?

119
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,360
Caught the attention of many. Secretly watched, you know?

120
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:31,150
Yeah, why not be like New? Smoothly blend in and mingle with guys.

121
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:39,410
Not like us, who look at them like they're the center of the universe.
Know what I mean, guys?

122
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:52,320
Oh, it's the same cheese, you guys! Whether it's girls, young or old,
they all want someone similar. Right?

123
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,550
Man, that's intense!
You've won Isabella's heart, right, ma'am? That's correct!

124
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:12,770
But I'm happy for New, though. Going on an exchange program abroad.
While we're here just singing "Husband, husband, husband" all the time!

125
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:20,290
We all want a husband more than anything else.
We'll study in Thailand and keep searching for a husband. Keep the faith!

126
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,030
Happy for New, though.
Whether it's any friend, if they can achieve like New, we're all happy.

127
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,320
By the way, where's the not-so-pretty lady?
Why isn't she here with us?

128
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,050
Are you talking about the two annoying ones?

129
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,770
Yeah, those two.

130
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,270
Heard they're out part-time job hunting, giving out samples near the school.

131
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:50,480
They're making some quick extra cash to buy gifts for New and pay for tonight's dinner.

132
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,080
Oh, those two are such fighters!
They're really going all out for our friend.

133
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,480
It's getting chilly now.
It's getting dark, and they still have to go to their part-time jobs.

134
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,360
We should go check on them for a bit. I feel oddly sentimental.

135
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,750
Oh no, are they in trouble?

136
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,960
Yeah, let's go in front of the school.

137
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
New!!!

138
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,910
Oh, hey, what's up?

139
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,700
What's going on? You called me like this, I'm excited!

140
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,650
Um... how did the exam go?

141
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,320
It went okay. What about you?

142
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,790
It went okay, too.

143
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,170
So, New, what's up?

144
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,620
Nothing, really.

145
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:59,360
Really? Well, how about we go find something delicious to eat tonight?

146
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,890
Jet... there's something I need to tell you.

147
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,550
What is it?

148
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,670
Um... so, I have to go on an exchange program to America.

149
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,510
Huh...

150
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:21,840
Yeah. So, the thing is... the exam results just came out, and I passed.

151
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,410
Just for a year, Jet.

152
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,620
When are you going?

153
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,270
In two weeks.

154
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,630
Just for a year? A whole year?

155
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,620
Just one year, Jet...

156
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Do you really want to go that much, New?

157
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,460
...Yes.

158
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,170
Again. Why do I always have to face things like this?

159
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:15,740
It's true I going for just a year, but I'd better suspend our status for both of us first.
We each go study, each live better life.

160
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,410
Why do we have to suspend it? I don't want it to be like this.

161
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,840
But I do.

162
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,100
Sorry, Jet. Goodbye.

163
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,770
Go ahead, New.
It must be really important to you, New.

164
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,100
Jet...

165
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:24,010
Wow, look at those two. What are they doing standing in front of the school?

166
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,860
We're working part-time. We just wanted some extra income.

167
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:37,130
Oh, part-time job? Why do you look so miserable?

168
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,030
You don’t want accepting samples.
Don't stand there looking like someone else, Jeedny.

169
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:52,360
I never thought you guys would end up like this.
Whether you're beautiful or not, and you're even poorer than I thought.

170
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:03,320
If our work of distributing samples honestly makes you jealous, then leave.
We'll keep working.

171
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,140
You're all pathetic.
Both you and the job you're doing. LOL

172
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:20,640
Wow, samples, huh? You're not just giving them out to people on Earth, are you?
Not to extraterrestrials or interdimensional beings?

173
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,720
Maybe you should invite interest or create a buzz first.
She won't receive them otherwise.

174
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,830
You guys dare to degrade yourselves like this.
Acting as if others are extraterrestrial beings or supernatural entities?

175
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,640
And how dare you, looking down on others like this, Jeedny?

176
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,420
Is that the reality?
Is it really that difficult for you, Pad and So? Just like people say.

177
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:47,030
Why are you doing this, Jeedny?
They're struggling, and you're making fun of them. How dare you?

178
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:57,160
Their working for money is something to be proud of and respected.
If they're good people, they should be able to understand.

179
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:08,000
Even she herself has nothing to be proud of or boast about.
She shouldn't come here insulting others like this, Jeedny.

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,810
Just like what you guys did to me, huh?
It's amazing. It's something to be proud of and respected, isn't it?

181
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,070
I'll step on each of you to the ground like this.

182
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,110
You can see for yourselves.

183
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:52,810
Why are you doing this, Jeedny?
We've already apologized and cleared things up that day. Aren't you satisfied yet, Jeedny?

184
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,660
If you're still angry, what do you want us to do, Jeedny?

185
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,270
How many hundreds or thousands of times do we have to apologize for you to be satisfied?
Are you still not happy, Jeedny?

186
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:13,050
Your apologies didn't come from the heart.
How many more times do you want to say it? I'll never forgive or pardon you.

187
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:23,640
It's up to you, Jeedny.
Whether you want to sink with the past that hurt you or move on, it's your choice, Jeedny.

188
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:31,380
Jeedny, listen to me. What's done is done.
That's all there is to it.

189
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,240
Just let it go, Jeedny. Go home. Acting like this isn't good.

190
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:43,720
We can't turn back time, but what I said that day,
I truly meant it.

191
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,010
You don't have to forgive or blame me, just stop. That's all.

192
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,660
You have to stop.
Stop without anything getting in the way, Jeedny.

193
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,680
Stop hating, stop drowning in the past. Live your life, Jeedny.

194
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:11,480
Geez... And will you guys ever see eye to eye with me?
I'll be your enemy until grade 12.

195
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,270
Remember that!

196
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,830
You must be holding a grudge.
You're so angry and hateful towards us.

197
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,090
But we can't help if she doesn't let go herself.

198
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:36,720
We're also in the wrong, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We don't want anyone to suffer from being bullied like this.

199
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,770
That's right. From now on, we have to be careful about what we say.
But hey, are we really good friends already? Hold on, let me pat my back.

200
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:52,830
Come on, let's help Pad and So distribute the samples more efficiently.
We need to finish quickly.

201
00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:05,720
Then it's better for us to share the gift we want to buy for New tonight.
We share it better among ourselves from the friend gang, M.4/13.

202
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:15,140
Being friends is fun. M.4/13, we tease each other, we argue,
but we're still friends, right?

203
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,960
Patting each other's backs, I'm beautiful!

204
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,460
So, you've known all along, huh, Go?
That New was going to leave.

205
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,140
Nah, just found out earlier.
New wanted to finish exams first before telling everyone.

206
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:08,160
Oh... and probably wanted to tell us after the exams, right?
New did mention to us before, wanting to go abroad.

207
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,270
Alright, whatever you want to do.

208
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,140
Huh, you're just the same, Go.

209
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, exactly. It's not like anyone's forcing you to do something you don't like.

210
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,420
Hey, it's a different matter altogether.

211
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,610
Haha, at first, I thought you were into New.

212
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,480
Hey, cut it out.

213
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,590
Yeah, that's right. Just let Jet handle it.

214
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,200
Damn, don't talk like that. I wasn't thinking anything.
Just talking and got misunderstood. We're friends, okay?

215
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,070
Being friends is fun, isn't it? LOL

216
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,420
You idiot. Don't talk nonsense like that.

217
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,550
Okay, okay, don't overdo it. You'll make them think for real.

218
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,030
Haha, okay then. I'll go first.

219
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,400
Go ahead. You guys go now.

220
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,640
See you later.

221
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,200
Alright.

222
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,380
Mit and Mac, the girls in our room are rooting for you guys, too, wow!

223
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:06,960
Oh man, why don't I have anyone? Everything's a pair, heavy stuff, huh?

224
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,140
I'm bored, really. Too many pairs, heavy stuff.

225
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,920
Did you call Jet?

226
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
Um...

227
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,220
He's probably feeling down.

228
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,900
It's not surprising, New. It must be hard for him.

229
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,550
I don't know what to do.

230
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,850
Just ignore it for now.

231
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,770
How... I about to leave in two weeks.

232
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,420
New, you know, right? That his ex-just left him like this.

233
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:17,000
And so? I didn't say we'd leave him... Uh...
Actually, I’m not really anything to Jet.

234
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,270
Give it some time.

235
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,700
New... Can I hug you?

236
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,000
Sure. Why wouldn't you be able to? But why would you hug me?

237
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,880
I'm hugging you as a friend. Aren't we friends?

238
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,850
Sure.

239
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,380
Thanks a lot, New.

240
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,330
I'm thankful too, Go.

241
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,790
This is our gift.

242
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:02,030
Really? You don't have to.

243
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,920
Of course. You're special for me, New. You're my friend.

244
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,830
Really, you don't have to, Go.

245
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,510
You have to. Keep it safe.

246
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,030
Thank you very much.

247
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,440
You're welcome.

248
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,440
New! Let's take a picture together! The others are waiting!

249
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,500
Okay!

250
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,850
Let's go!

251
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,070
Jet! Where are you?

252
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,740
Oh, you're here now?

253
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,350
What's wrong with you?

254
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,850
You should understand me, man.

255
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,050
I do understand, but you should go find New.

256
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,160
I don't know...
What am I supposed to say when I see her? Say goodbye?

257
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,940
My luck, I only meet people who want to go abroad. What the heck?

258
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,790
It's just going abroad, man. Don't overthink it.

259
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:21,310
Next time, if I like someone, I have to ask first if they want to go abroad, huh?

260
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,200
You're drunk, man.

261
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,440
I'm disappointed, man... Starting over is really hard.

262
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,740
Jet, you're thinking too much. Don't assume everyone is the same.
If you really like New, are you just going to let her go?

263
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:44,140
And don’t you want to know how New feels about you?

264
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,720
Don't forget to bring your jacket with you. You might feel uncomfortable later.

265
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,240
Is everything ready, dear? What else do we need?

266
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,660
Everything is ready.

267
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,480
2 weeks later...

268
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,510
Is there something important that I want to tell you from my mouths?
Can you listen to it for the last time?

269
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,850
What are you waiting for? Stop playing around. Let's go now!!

270
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:20,090
New, go tomorrow afternoon my friend.

271
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,290
Have you forgotten anything, son?

272
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,030
No, Dad, everything's ready.

273
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,460
Alright then, let's get in the car.

274
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,310
What's this!!

275
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,070
Dad!!! It's New's friend.

276
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,010
Huh?

277
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,220
Please give me a moment.

278
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,940
Why are you here like this?

279
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,590
I'm sorry...

280
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,290
We couldn't bear it.

281
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Are you really leaving now?

282
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:20,610
The important thing I want to say... it's about New's status.
Can I tell you?

283
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:32,880
Jet... I think we understand each other's feelings well already.

284
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,000
I want Jet to trust me.

285
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,180
I don't know what will happen when we're apart,
but I'll come back...

286
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:58,140
If Jet remains the same, we can still be together. Let's travel together again.

287
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:06,380
Right now, I don't feel like going at all.

288
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,550
Hmm, okay. It must be really good.

289
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,500
Your eyes are all red.

290
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,070
Take care of yourself, Jet.

291
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,440
Let's go. I promised I would be the same.

292
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:50,010
New, take care of yourself too.

293
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,530
Same to you, Jet.

294
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,700
Let's go now. Mom and Dad must be waiting.

295
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,790
Goodbye.

296
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,830
This is the story of me and my friends. It's really fun to be friends, isn't it?

297
00:33:49,830 --> 00:34:01,460
Many people might want to know how my friends are like.
With the new semester opening for 11th graders, are Jet and New still together?

298
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:08,900
Are we still in the same class for the new semester?
Even my own story, you probably want to know, right?

299
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:25,980
Alright, let me tell you again when I'm in a good mood. Right now, I want to reminisce and immerse myself in yesterday's atmosphere.

300
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,960
Right now, the atmosphere is really great.
