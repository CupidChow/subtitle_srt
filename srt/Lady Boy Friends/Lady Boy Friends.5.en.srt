1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,639
Hey! They're supposed to be twins. How come they're not the same size?

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,320
Oh, that's wicked! I don't think they're always the same.
Even if they're twins, they might not be exactly the same size.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,960
So, today, shall we go and find out?

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
Let's go.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,640
Then let's collect the stuff.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,440
Hold on! No need to collect, I'll bring it. The janitors will come to collect anyway.
We're already screwed.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,679
Hurry up and follow.

8
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,920
Ohhh, naughty!

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,359
Come back here!

10
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,359
What did you guys see?!

11
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,000
We could barely see anything clearly.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,480
And when we saw them peeing, will we really know their actual size?

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,680
Yeah, true. I forgot about that.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,120
Let's go home then. We'll find another opportunity next time.
Those twins, finding an opportunity won't be difficult.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,879
Yeah, they don't seem to be very careful.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,359
Alright, let's head back.
I want to have some smoothies outside the school. It's so refreshing.

17
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,239
Refreshing like the smell we're inhaling, huh

18
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,239
Indeed.

19
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,439
Satisfaction. Go home!

20
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:53,920
I really want to know who can help them for real, darn it!!!

21
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,879
It's locked.

22
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,400
Help, please!

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,919
Oh no!

24
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,240
Help, please!

25
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:29,240
I can't climb up. Who locked it?

26
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:49,759
This is bad! How are we going to stay in this school? Why is it so scary here?

27
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:55,400
Ohhh, don't be afraid anymore. Look at yourself in the mirror.
You're beautiful. You don't have to be afraid of anything. Seriously!

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Hey, even if you're scared, why bite each other? Your face is indeed handsome.
I've never stopped being scared. The fear is real!

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,960
Hmmm, I'll smack you soon. Newcomers like us need to be prepared.
I've also felt the radiation of evil,

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:22,319
whether it's from overly beautiful gangs, the Olive Gang, or that Jeedny.
There are even other groups like the tough ones. We can't lose, you know.

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,360
Alright, I'll fight to the end. I've got the determination to study here now. We won't lose.

32
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:37,960
And what about your lucky number, huh? Scrape until you see the next new year's numbers. Haven't got them yet? Wait until someone else sees. Embarrassing, huh?

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:46,639
Ohhh, why feel embarrassed? We'll have to wait patiently for the lucky numbers.
Can't ask for the daytime ones. It has to be the nighttime ones.

34
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:56,680
We can't rush. Our parents can't afford to buy a lot this time.
Just two or three numbers will do, my dear.

35
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,319
Hahaha!

36
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,800
What are you two scraping for? I'll squeeze your necks if you keep going! Hahaha!

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,120
Oh no!

38
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,800
What was that sound, Pat? Did you hear it too?

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,920
I did, but I can't get up. Help me!

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,160
Ohhhhh!

41
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,800
Holy shit, please wait!

42
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:33,279
Facing these ghostly faces like them, it's just something you have to deal with.

43
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,240
Hahaha!

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,120
What happened to you guys?
Why do you look so down? You seem terrible.

45
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
That's because of you-know-who! What's going on?

46
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:20,040
You didn't sleep all night. Those two are the same.
They look like they've seen ghosts. Are they scaring themselves?

47
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,399
What happened to those two?

48
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,600
We were haunted by ghosts! It was terrifying!

49
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey! Does our school have ghosts?

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Is that so? Our school has ghosts?

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,879
Yes, we encountered them yesterday. It's just as you see here.

52
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,560
Initially, there weren't any. But now there are two.

53
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,120
Oops!

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,079
What's this?

55
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,600
Isn't this your handiwork from yesterday's incident?

56
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,879
Your skills! What's up with that!!!???
We didn't do anything, you guys!

57
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,079
Stop it.

58
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,839
Oh, it's you.

59
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,600
It wasn't you guys who trapped us in the men's bathroom all night?

60
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,519
No, I didn't do anything like that.

61
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:16,319
Who would do something so low?
I even dislike your faces, but I've never thought of doing anything low like that.

62
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,639
Honestly, I don't think it's the skill of all three of you.

63
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:26,279
Just wondering about Big and Nic.
When we ran out of the bathroom yesterday, did anyone see anyone around there?

64
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:32,079
Didn't see anyone.
Just kept startling you guys. Zip up, pulled up pants, and quickly came out of there.

65
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,120
And don't sneak a peek at us like that again.

66
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,319
Didn't sneak a peek.

67
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,920
Who's sneaking a peek?
Nobody's doing that.

68
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,000
Really, Slut ladyboys? Hungry and locked up in the bathroom. Deserved it.

69
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,439
Beautiful like us, not a danger to society.

70
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,959
Right, Parasite.

71
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,240
Stop being smart.

72
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,279
Thief's life.

73
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,079
Talk too much.
I told you not to look for food in the bathroom when you're hungry.

74
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,839
I didn't go peek at the guys. I just went to get stuff.

75
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:13,879
There's a cafeteria. Why go look for food in the bathroom?
You guys don't know anything. Confused. Slut ladyboys, you have mental problems.

76
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,399
Confused. Didn't sleep last night. Fell asleep quickly.

77
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,279
I'm going to report it. I'm going to report it.
Report to catch all of you.

78
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,839
New!!!

79
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,079
Oh, why haven't you returned yet?

80
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,839
I went to the music club.
Why are you still walking around here?

81
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,759
No one at home came to pick me up, so I just kept walking.

82
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,279
Oh, then let's go pick you up.

83
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,080
No worries, they'll come get me soon.

84
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,799
They must have arrived by now after waiting for so long.

85
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,240
They should.

86
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,039
Hello...

87
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,879
About half an hour.

88
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:19,440
So, shall I have my friend pick me up? A friend from our class.
Alright then, okay. Bye.

89
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,799
Then come back with me, okay?

90
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,720
Okay, thanks.

91
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,679
No problem.

92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
When is Mac coming?

93
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Oh, you scared me! Why are you standing quietly?

94
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,399
Well, tomorrow is my birthday.

95
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,679
Oh, happy early birthday then!

96
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,399
Wait a moment,

97
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,440
this time I want a doll.

98
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,720
A doll?

99
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:20,279
Yeah, like before.
Give it to me in class and don't tell anyone else.

100
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,840
What's there to be proud of?

101
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,120
Hmm, just a bit.

102
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,039
Alright, they'll definitely be jealous of me.

103
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,480
Well, I’m rich, so I can do anything.

104
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,279
Jet, are you here to enjoy the view?

105
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,480
Um, I just want to breathe some fresh air.

106
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,759
Now?

107
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,200
Yeah, it's getting late. Come here quickly.

108
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,159
Wow, it's really cool.

109
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, New, let's do it together.

110
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,200
Do what?

111
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,480
Like this.

112
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,799
What are you going to do? Something like Titanic?

113
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,320
Do you like it, Rose?

114
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,960
Haha, no thanks. I don't want to be Rose.

115
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Why not?

116
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,559
Well... in the end, Rose is alone.

117
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,600
This Jack guy isn't that easy to die, huh?

118
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,960
Um, just kidding. We're just joking.

119
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,559
Oh, I see. Do you usually come here often?

120
00:11:52,559 --> 00:12:02,080
Well... not really.
Usually only when I'm stressed out or just feel like it.

121
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,840
And do you usually come alone?

122
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,240
Alone…

123
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,720
Oh, you come to pose as the main character in a music video, huh?

124
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:19,080
More or less. Mostly it's just a feeling.

125
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,600
So, what's the feeling now?

126
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,559
Hmm? I don't know. Comfortable, I guess.

127
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,039
Anyway, we're all here now. Let's take a selfie together.

128
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:00,600
Sorry, I wasn't ready. Um...

129
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,159
It's okay, New. It's my fault for startling you.

130
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,120
Oops!

131
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,679
Oh! Delete it! I don't want it. Delete it!

132
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,240
Why delete it? You look cute.

133
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,320
I don't want it.

134
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,039
Look at New's face.

135
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,159
Wait, Jet's girls might see it.

136
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,240
If they see it, that's fine.

137
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,440
Maybe. Let's go back together. I want to go back.

138
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,759
Oh, really? Me too, I'm so happy.
Let's go back together.

139
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,720
Ooh, would that be nice? Thank you.

140
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,279
Bell! What are you up to!?

141
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,000
Oops! Nothing, just rehearsing a play.

142
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,879
Rehearsing a play for what? You can do it alone!

143
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:32,320
Um... well, maybe you guys are a bit too dark.
Today's my birthday, and you're not giving me anything?

144
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,600
Giggles!!!
[Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support us]

145
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
We'll get to it later.

146
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,639
We can choose another day, yeah?

147
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,840
Other days are available.

148
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,279
Um, Are you hungry? why not go find something to eat?

149
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,080
Oh!

150
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,480
True. Shall we go find something to eat? I'm starting to get hungry.

151
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,279
Hold on a second.
Let's just play volleyball first. I'm not that hungry yet.

152
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,919
But earlier, you said you were hungry.

153
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm still not hungry.

154
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
You're not warming up your body?

155
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,559
Nope. I'll start sweating. My face will break.

156
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,000
Right! Let's just do something light.

157
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,799
Your faces haven't broken yet?

158
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,399
Check your own face first.

159
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,799
What broken face? I'm beautiful!

160
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,200
Confident face, never change!!!

161
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,360
Your eyeliner is running.

162
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,440
It's a character.

163
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,559
Use waterproof next time. Just letting you know.

164
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,360
Thank you for letting me know.

165
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,039
Happy birthday, Bell.

166
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,879
Naughty! Did Mac give it to me?

167
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,200
Yes.

168
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,960
Oh! Thank you. Can I have a hug?

169
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,840
I think there's something fishy.

170
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,200
True. Smiles like a business deal.

171
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,840
How did you know I like dolls?

172
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,799
You mentioned it...

173
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,519
Oops! Thank you. Thank you so much!

174
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,759
The cutest ever!

175
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,519
He gave me a doll!!!

176
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,480
The cutest in the world!

177
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,799
Yesterday, when you said you bought something for this girl,
did you mean Belle?

178
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah.

179
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,240
Huh!? Are you gay?

180
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,440
Are you crazy! Just like you!

181
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,279
Huh? Am I gay?

182
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,600
You crazy! No!!
How did you figure out it's Bell's birthday?

183
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,000
Well... it's on Facebook. Just giving my own gift.
What's so weird?

184
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,360
Not weird?

185
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,279
oday, you're so surprised that you gave Bell a doll.

186
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,440
Uh... haha.

187
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,920
Smooth move! Suddenly you've turned into Bell's boy.

188
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,880
Crazy! I didn't turn into anyone.

189
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
Hmm, you've been dating for a long time.
Liking someone like Bell and not saying anything.

190
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
Huh!! Oh no!

191
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,200
Mac!! Why can't you walk properly!

192
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,880
Can you walk or not?

193
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,519
I can, I can.

194
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,440
Can't walk, huh? Come here.

195
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
What's up?

196
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,359
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and hop on. My legs hurt.

197
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,319
That's funny! No need.

198
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,079
You're still playing around. Hurry up! I'm too lazy to support you!

199
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,839
Alright.

200
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,440
Haha, that's funny.

201
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,400
Oh, see this little guy? He's actually quite heavy.

202
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll carry it all the way to the school gate.

203
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,319
It's possible, you know.

204
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,759
No way! Mac isn't interested in the dragon of Mulan!!!

205
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,880
But situations like this are tricky, Nut.
Everyone has different tastes.

206
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,240
That's true, girl.
But the dynamics between Mit and Bell are totally different.

207
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,680
Whoa! Drama alert!! Mac and Mit, huh? Not good.

208
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,799
At first, I didn't think much about it. But earlier,

209
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:13,839
I went to the bathroom and saw Mac giving Mit a ride on his back.
They looked so happy together. I was shocked!

210
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,960
What!! That's intense!

211
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,200
Screaminggggg!

212
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,519
Is it true?!

213
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,200
Dead! This world is getting tougher every day!

214
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
The world has been tough since you guys were born!

215
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,200
Her face is what makes it tough.

216
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,839
Tough and old ladyboy!

217
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:31,000
Burn, guys!!!

218
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,599
Listen, I have to tell you. Mac doesn't have anything going on with Mit,
because he gave me the doll.

219
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,119
Wow!!! So beautiful!

220
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm so pretty.

221
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,400
Keep your mouth shut!

222
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,920
Oh, you! We're the same.

223
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,839
Oh, forget it.

224
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:57,759
Are you trying to cast a spell on Mac?
Because your appearance is like a witch doctor.

225
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,799
Definitely, you must be a witch or a water sprite!!

226
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,160
No, just pure beauty.

227
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,839
Beautiful at what time?

228
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,960
Once you're done being beautiful, let me know.

229
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Someone should buy her a mirror to look into.
She'd feel secure right away.

230
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey, why are these two waiting?
Aren't they going with their friend?

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Not going, right?

232
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,519
Then come on.
Hurry up.

233
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,799
See you later, ugly ladyboy.

234
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,119
Hurry back and see me, ugly.

235
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,559
Oh no, the floating ghost.

236
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,279
I think there's definitely something.

237
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:37,240
That's it, I thought so too.

238
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,640
Their faces are funny, and their actions are funny too.

239
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,839
Funny all three of them. We're beautiful. Gorgeous.

240
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,079
Oh really? There's more? I thought there were two more ghosts.

241
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,839
Why are you smiling?

242
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:25,400
Jet! Um, are you here to eat?

243
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,119
Yeah, sure. Let's go sit together.

244
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,000
Why do you always like to come quietly?

245
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Surprise, how about that?

246
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,119
What surprise?

247
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,039
You scared me.

248
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,480
Just saw you standing there smiling alone.

249
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,599
What were you smiling about earlier?

250
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,759
Hey, New. Is it okay, or...

251
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,440
or... do we need to do it again?

252
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,200
Oops, New... your heart is racing.

253
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,839
What! Are you crazy?

254
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:29,359
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I forgot myself.

255
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,599
Forgetting often isn't good. This is school. Anyone could see.

256
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,880
Let's go.

257
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,319
Oh, where are you going?

258
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,240
New... New!

259
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,759
Oh, what are you doing, Jet?

260
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,160
Hi there! Today, we're going to cook noodles together. Let's follow my steps.

261
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,359
First, just pour it in. Pour it all in, it's going to be delicious.

262
00:25:50,359 --> 00:26:00,240
Still not sure? Well, you have to pour it all in like this.
Next, let's add some chili.

263
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:11,039
Just a little chili, not too much. Let's put it all in. This is it. Perfect!

264
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:29,079
Looking at me with envy, huh?
Jealous of my skills. Why can't you do it like me? I'm shining!

265
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:38,680
Who's jealous? They're admiring with awe.
Ugly doll Jeedny, I'm the prettiest!

266
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:46,440
What kind of shine is that?
It's just visual crime clear as day.

267
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:57,240
Seriously, she's eating that spicy? That must be super spicy.
Bold move, wanting to be famous.

268
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:06,759
Just watch. I'll be the new TikTok star.
No one can resist my fame.

269
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:17,519
Oh my, is that many people following your gorgeousness?
Monstrous ego.

270
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:27,759
Where did you get that confidence from?
If it's too much, you'll need the second pill in hospital.

271
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:42,359
No matter how much you show off, it's not loud enough.
Because your face's plagiarism steals every scene.

272
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,920
I am the epitome of beauty in this world.
This clip will be my debut.

273
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:55,000
Thinking of anything stupid, huh?
You're not even pretty, so you have to act weird.

274
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,640
The lowest level does exist. You're the low level of this world, Jeedny!

275
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,039
This is a student, sir.
She brought the seasonings from the shop to play and take content.

276
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:28,960
Why are you acting like this? How can you play with food like this?
It's not beautiful at all.

277
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,680
No, I brought it to eat for real.

278
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,519
This is it. I still see the bowl full.

279
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,680
Kids often bring seasonings from the shop to play like this, sir.
That's what the school notified us about.

280
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,799
But this child might like spicy and intense flavors, right?
Why aren't you eating?

281
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,200
Yes, sir. I really want to eat it.

282
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,480
Okay, then eat it all up. I have other things to do.

283
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,480
Oh, do you really, sir?

284
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,759
Yes, I do. Eat up.

285
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,400
If you like intense flavors, why aren't you eating?
Why don't you eat it all?

286
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,599
Yes, sir. I'll eat it.

287
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,319
Okay?

288
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay, Teacher

289
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,000
You have something to do..?

290
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,759
I waiting for you finish.

291
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,839
Hurry up and eat.

292
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,279
I'll wait for you to finish eating. Once you're done, I'll leave.

293
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,839
Wow…

294
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,839
Yes, low thinking indeed.

295
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,359
I eat slowly.

296
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:21,279
or... do we need to do it again?

297
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:20,640
I’m shining like no other! All I get is likes. I'm so beautiful!

298
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:38,880
Are you crazy? You jealous,
Jeedny? Stop using my catchphrase right now!

299
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:50,400
Oh no! Why can't I speak?
Did you copyright this phrase or what? I have no idea! Insulting!

300
00:32:50,400 --> 00:33:00,119
Oh wow! This is my catchphrase, Jeedny!
Shocking and mind-blowing!

301
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:08,519
How dare you!
Did you copyright this phrase? Insulting me 9,999 times!

302
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,240
Oh my god! This is my catchphrase, Jeedny!
Shocking and unexpected!

303
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,799
Insult me all you want! I'm beautiful!

304
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:21,079
Ohhh!!!

305
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm going to announce my birth on social media.
You guys will be jealous of me.

306
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,160
Haha, I want to laugh till my teeth fall out!
Have you watched another clip related to yourself or not?

307
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:43,759
You should try to widen your eyes. You're getting famous now.
No matter what, you'll find it. Try scrolling down. Haha!

308
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:50,519
That's right. You're fantastic.
You're shining. You're truly beautiful, Jeedny. Try widening your eyes.

309
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,799
Do you feel proud now?

310
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,599
Let's see.

311
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,200
What clip? I just uploaded one clip.

312
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,119
If you're still not embarrassed enough, do it again.
Look at the comments.

313
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,159
Do you really feel proud of yourself, or are you just proud of what you've done?

314
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,000
This comment says, 'Are you crazy?' Haha!

315
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,400
You haven't even announced it yet, and you're already shutting down.
I'm beautiful!

316
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:38,360
If you're still not embarrassed enough, try again.
Find a more creative content. Be famous in a better way.

317
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:48,320
Keep on repeating yourself. Let's go, we're with the lowly ones, in the lowly places.
It makes us look even lower.

318
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,199
I hope you're truly proud, Jeedny. Let's go.
