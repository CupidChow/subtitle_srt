1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Don't bother with me! Leave.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,960
I can't just stop bothering with you!!

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:14,670
I'm tried, tried not to look, not to care... but I couldn't do it.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,440
It might sound funny... me saying to break up with you.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,710
I thought I wasn't ready, not ready to have someone.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,030
But I can't just break up myself.

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,960
When I was with you, those good feelings were real.

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,960
As we delved deeper... I got scared.

9
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,920
Scared that I'd get hurt if I truly loved someone.

10
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,680
So you hurt someone else instead?

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,120
You avoided me, didn't answer my calls,
and now where were you last night?

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
Why?

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:28,120
Why, why, why?
What do you want me to do to satisfy you?

14
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,200
No, I'm leaving. I have plans.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,230
Where are you going? Let's talk first.
You avoid like this, do you really want to talk?

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:47,310
Jet, I'm stressed. Jet, tell me what's going on.
I can't take it anymore, Jet.

17
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,560
Jet... New is stressed.

18
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,560
New doesn't know what's going on with Jet. Just tell New, New is very stressed.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,200
New, I'm sorry...

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,470
But now I realize, I truly like you.

21
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know if I can trust anything you say anymore.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,430
I'm not sure about you anymore.

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,520
I don't want to be foolish anymore. You can go back now.

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,470
New...

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,280
I don't know how to make you believe, but I'll make you see it yourself.

26
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:50,190
I've been studying for two to three years, and I'm still dumb.
I can't even remember how to use 'a, e, i, o, u'. Can you believe it?

27
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,750
You've been taking exams since elementary school.

28
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,800
You're too harsh on me. I'm just joking around.

29
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,000
Hmm, seems like Jet's in a good mood today.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,310
Yeah, New seems more adorable now.

31
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,000
You!

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,560
Oh my, we've got some lovebirds here.

33
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,310
That's enough! And where are the others, still not here to study?

34
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,710
They'll probably come soon if they wake up.

35
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,720
Still clueless.

36
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,920
Let's wear matching shirts.

37
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,430
What are we waiting for?

38
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,430
Hey, I need a break for a moment, buddy. I'm tired.
Just a quick pause.

39
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,270
Alright, just a moment, pal.

40
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,160
How's it going?

41
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,870
Why did you come out?
Why not continue playing?

42
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,830
Oh, I'm just tired. Taking a break... So, New, anything on your mind?

43
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,310
Not really.
I just feel like looking at things around, wanting to remember everything.

44
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,480
What's that?
Talking as if you're going somewhere, are you planning to leave the planet?

45
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:14,160
Hey, Go, I have a question.
If you had to choose between a dream and a loved one, what would you choose?

46
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,680
…I'd choose both.

47
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,830
Then why ask if you can choose both!

48
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,950
Haha, I'd probably choose... the loved one.

49
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,430
Really? Why is that?

50
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:39,240
I don't know. But sometimes, our loved ones might just be our dreams.
Some people spend their whole lives searching for love, it's as elusive as dreams, New.

51
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,950
But dreams aren't easy to find or make either.

52
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,510
That's true. It depends on the person and the opportunities.
Why did you ask that, New?

53
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,270
Oh, nothing... Just curious.

54
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey, did you guys see anything just now?

55
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,480
See what?

56
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,920
It's Go and New, isn't it? They seem oddly close.

57
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Yeah, I think so too. It's like they could be twins with me.

58
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,830
So, what do you guys think is going on?

59
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,160
I think Go and New must have something between them.

60
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,480
And what exactly is that "something"?
Are they like the couples that girls say Mit and I are?

61
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,310
It's not like you guys, I can tell.

62
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:02,510
Yeah, it's not like the nonsense couples you two are.
We two think there must be something more than that.

63
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,190
Yeah.

64
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,190
Those two devil twins are up to something, I'm thinking along with you guys.

65
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,600
We're speaking the truth here.

66
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,160
Yeah.

67
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,360
Done yet?

68
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
How's it going, Pete?

69
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,840
What's up?

70
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,750
Your girls, man. How far have you gotten with them?
Are they your girlfriends yet?

71
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,960
Not yet. Why the rush?

72
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,480
Hmm, if you're not in a hurry, maybe they're not interested.

73
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,750
What's up with that?
Let them take their time. It depends on them anyway.

74
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,600
Hey, what's going on?
How do you make the ladies respond?

75
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,960
Well, what can I do?
If I'm flirting with them and waiting for them to respond, it's up to them.

76
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,870
You've got to be more assertive, play a little harder to get.
Don't give in too easily.

77
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,030
Yeah, this one's quite the expert.

78
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,550
I've tried that before, but... When I play hard to get and wait for them to initiate,
I just can't resist initiating first every time.

79
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,750
Dang, that's weak.

80
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,910
What's going on?
Let me see your faces. Are they pretty?

81
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,270
Hey, you're cute. I want to have pretty girlfriends like that.

82
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,840
Are you sure you want to have pretty ones?

83
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,720
Well, you know, who wouldn't want to?

84
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Thought you wanted a pretty, handsome, sweet-faced one like New.

85
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,320
Geez! We're talking about different things here.

86
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,750
Is that so?

87
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,910
Go to bed.

88
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,550
Who are you sleeping with? Haha

89
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,270
Why is the chat so heavy on the right?

90
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,960
Well, they're starting to respond less.

91
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,030
They'll reply soon.

92
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,870
Hey.

93
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,150
Damn.

94
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,720
Why is it so hard?

95
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,910
Hey, isn't it true?

96
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,670
Damn.

97
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,670
Hey, why is it so stiff?

98
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,630
Damn, it's tough. Why is it hard now?

99
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,150
Hey.

100
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,080
What am I even doing?

101
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,480
Just go down.

102
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,600
What am I even?

103
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:51,630
Focus on making the exam. The results will have to compete with students from other schools.
It's crucial for your future.

104
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,320
If you have any doubts, ask... Alright, let's get to work. You can do it.

105
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:58,150
It's okay if I don't get it. If I do, it's a bonus.

106
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Can I do it?

107
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,150
Have you done your homework?

108
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,750
Nope.

109
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,360
I haven't done it either, you jerk.

110
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
And you still haven't done it?

111
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,910
Nope, no time.

112
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,270
I thought you did it already.

113
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,960
How come you still haven't done it? Why do you have so many left?

114
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,840
Overall.

115
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,840
How come you still haven't done it?
Where's your time going?

116
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm at home with my little brother.

117
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,600
What's that got to do with your little brother? Huh?

118
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,670
I like my stuff.

119
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,440
Are you smitten with a girl or something, you fool?

120
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,790
What's wrong with you? Are you frozen?

121
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,870
So, are you going to do it or not?

122
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,200
Not yet.

123
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,150
Go, Go? (spoken without sound)

124
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,960
Where's New? (spoken without sound)

125
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,870
I don't know. (spoken without sound)

126
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,390
Huh? (spoken without sound)

127
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,960
Oh, to the library. (spoken without sound)

128
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,080
Really? Okay. (spoken without sound)

129
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,360
You're so gullible.

130
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,790
What am I even? Feeling weird, huh?

131
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,670
What's up with you, Go?

132
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,030
Oh, nothing, really. Just gotta do homework.

133
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,360
Just gotta do homework, friend. I'm nothing special.

134
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
You're talking to yourself.

135
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,480
Oh, nothing.

136
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:17,830
What am I even? Am I just confused, or am I like Jet? Ohhh...

137
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,590
Hey!

138
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,270
I’ve done it.

139
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,550
I don't know how to make you believe, but I'll show you.

140
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,550
Hi.

141
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,550
What a coincidence.

142
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,070
Really?
It's like I've seen you walking back and forth several times.

143
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,880
Oh, I was just looking for a friend. Next door.

144
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,160
Oh, really?

145
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,880
Yeah...

146
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:10,880
Well... Do you want to go on a trip with me?

147
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,680
Huh?

148
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,880
I want to go on a trip with you. Want to go?

149
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,070
Sure.

150
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,270
Really?

151
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,790
Yay!!

152
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
Seriously.

153
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,920
Um...

154
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,350
Really.

155
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,160
Um...

156
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,960
Hey, New

157
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
What are you looking at?

158
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Just scrolling through TikTok. Funny clips.

159
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,480
Go... I have something to tell you.

160
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,110
Hmm, what is it?

161
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,440
Well, there's this student exchange program with scholarship opportunities.

162
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,480
Oh, I've heard about it before.

163
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:29,270
Yeah, I'm really interested. I've wanted to be an exchange student for a long time.
I've wanted to be a graphic designer since I was a kid.

164
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,880
You should give it a try. I think you'd be great.

165
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,510
Go!

166
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,070
Huh?

167
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,830
Actually, I've already passed the exam.

168
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,200
Huh? You passed the exam?

169
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,240
Yes, I did. I'll be an exchange student soon.

170
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,880
Congratulations, New! That's amazing! Did you really pass the exam?

171
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,030
Thank you!

172
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,480
Are you serious?

173
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,880
Yes, I am.

174
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,350
You passed the exam, right? You're so talented. You did it.

175
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,000
You're really smart. How was the exam? Was it difficult?

176
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,750
It was challenging.

177
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,240
You must be really talented to be able to go abroad like this.

178
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,790
Yes, in two more weeks, I'll be leaving.

179
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,830
Two weeks!

180
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,880
It's happening so fast, New.

181
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Yes, thank you.

182
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,680
You're really talented. Congratulations.

183
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
Congratulations, for real.

184
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,680
New!

185
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,440
Oh, you're still here?

186
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
Waiting for you, New.

187
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,200
Why are you waiting?

188
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,480
Let's go play.

189
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,480
Huh? Play what?

190
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,960
Come up here.

191
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
Seriously?

192
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,310
Yep, come on up.

193
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,270
Where do you want to go?

194
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,550
Let's just go anywhere.

195
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,240
Oh, walk a bit slower, I might fall.

196
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:37,160
Just hug onto me, you won't fall.

197
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,880
How's it going? Do you like it?

198
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,750
I like it... didn't expect Jet to be the kind of person to come to a place like this.

199
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,830
Why not?

200
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:14,240
I don't know.
Thought you'd be more into, like... clubs, bars, or something.

201
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,030
Hmm, understand.

202
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,400
Hey.

203
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,960
Haha, just kidding.

204
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,030
I actually like places like this.

205
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,720
Why?

206
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,070
It makes me think of certain people.

207
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,830
My ex, actually...

208
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,590
Oh, really?

209
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,750
I never thought there'd be a day when we'd break up...

210
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:38,350
But what they say about time healing everything, it's true.

211
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,270
Jet...

212
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:50,480
I'm okay... I've been okay for a long time now, and now I'm really happy.

213
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,310
I'm happy because of you.

214
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm happy too.

215
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,400
Is it because of me?

216
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,440
No, it's because I've finished all my exam books.

217
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,030
Really?!

218
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,240
Let's go.

219
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,830
Hey, where to?

220
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,160
New, wait.

221
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,400
New.

222
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,590
New, how about we go cycling?

223
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,510
Hmm, sounds interesting.

224
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,790
Let's go.

225
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,750
I'll ride the bike.

226
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,070
Okay.

227
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,680
Hey, did you go talk to the teacher already?
That was quick.

228
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:06,070
Yeah, well, Go, Big, Nic,
I’m talked to Teacher Mo about our behavior grades being deducted.

229
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,830
What's up with that?

230
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,000
The teacher said she'll observe our behavior going forward,

231
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,640
but she also mentioned that if we improve, work harder, and focus on studying,
she might increase our behavior grades to match our classmates.

232
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,720
Damn, I can't even manage being the class leader as well as you, Mit.

233
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,270
You said it.

234
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:31,110
Thanks a lot, man.
Oh, Pete, you're not feeling down about it, are you?

235
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,680
I am, but I'm also sad about a girl.

236
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
Again.

237
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:43,830
Geez, Pete, you've been sitting there all morning.
Your books are still open in the same spot. You haven't gone anywhere.

238
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:52,720
Pete, you're hopeless. Girls are going to make your grades drop, man.
Mit's trying to help, just stop.

239
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,830
Uh, yeah.

240
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,550
Well, love is the poison of studying, for sure.

241
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,480
Do you want it, though?

242
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,510
I want it, yes.

243
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,160
Let's do it, then, guys. What are we waiting for?

244
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,350
Haha!

245
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,110
Graduating together with a doctor.

246
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,830
Studying together with friends, graduating with a doctor.

247
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,030
Staying here for a long time, focusing on developing the school.

248
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,510
That's the way it should be. Don't want a school that doesn't prosper.

249
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,680
Hey, let's talk, come on.

250
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,240
Being friends at school.

251
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,680
Hey, let's talk, come on.

252
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,110
Thinking about girls, huh?

253
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,110
Again? Again.

254
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,510
I'm happy for you, but remember, you have to make it happen.

255
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,590
Thank you, teacher.

256
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,750
You have another friend from another school who will be going on an program.

257
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,310
Oh, where is he going?

258
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,240
He's going to Australia.

259
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh...

260
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,440
You went to America, which was a great choice.
I heard you're interested in graphic design as well, right?

261
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes, teacher.

262
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:09,350
That's another feather in your cap there.
But besides academics, life skills, adaptability, and connections are important too.

263
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:15,160
Having good friends to rely on is crucial.
If you have good friends, I believe your future will be bright.

264
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Yes, teacher. I'll do my best.

265
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,640
Oh, are you here to submit your work?

266
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Let me see it then.

267
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,440
Teacher, may I have a moment first?

268
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,790
Okay, we'll talk about it later then.

269
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,070
Yes.

270
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,440
In that case, I'd like to have a moment too. Good bye, teacher.

271
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,200
New, New, wait...

272
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,880
Why rush like that?

273
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,790
Are you avoiding me?

274
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,510
Oh, no, not at all.

275
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,480
Really... So, what did you talk to the teacher about earlier?

276
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,270
Didn't you hear?

277
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
If I heard, would I be asking you?

278
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,750
Um... no, we talked about exam scores.

279
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,000
Why? Did you fail the exam?

280
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,350
Not exactly... I almost failed, so I consulted the teacher about it.

281
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,830
Oh, is that so?

282
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,920
Yeah... Why? If I fail, would you tutor me?

283
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,270
No, I already have friends tutoring me.

284
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,270
Oh, I see.
