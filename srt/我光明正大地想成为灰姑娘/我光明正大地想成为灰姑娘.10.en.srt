A brave warrior who can
go wherever she wants.

6
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,239
You must've known as a kid that...

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,640
you were much cooler and
stronger than you thought.

10
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,320
Why must you be like this until the end?

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,719
Why did you have to tell
me I'm strong and cool?

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,560
How did I become like this?

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,358
Seriously, I've had enough!

14
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,319
Why must I suffer because of you?

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,400
Mom. Don't go.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,079
I'll be a good girl, Mom.

Mom.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,799
I wasn't treasured as a kid.

19
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,479
Back then,

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,439
I thought I couldn't be
loved like the others.

21
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,280

become smaller and smaller.

What do I do now, honey?

27
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,479
What do I do?

28
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,090
Thinking someone as worthless
as me had no right to cry,

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
I cried alone.

30
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,959
You've been hating
yourself for a long time,

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,760
viewing the world
through the lens of hatred.

32
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,759
But above all...

33
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,079
I've removed the lens for you.

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Because I hated myself,

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,400
I couldn't tell you my feelings for you.

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,479
The truth is,

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,120
I was in pain because
I couldn't love myself.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,439
When I grow up, I want
to become an invincible...

43

49

What? Then what about Mr. Moon?

50
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,730
He lost everything overnight
without any time to prepare.

51
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,879
His dad kicked him out, and
his wedding went down the drain.

52
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,000
He's a goner.

53

But why?

61
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,879
I can't go with you when I have feelings...

62

for a different guy.

63
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,360
But things won't work
out with him. Aren't I right?

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,959
I'm simply doing as my
heart tells me to. I'm sorry.

65

How will you survive alone?

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,959
No matter what happens, I'll trust myself.

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,199
I wanted to be with you.

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,040
After all, you changed my disgrace
into something to be proud of.

73
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,439
Being with you would've cheered me up more.

74
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,439
That's not true.

75
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,519
You're more than capable now.

76

you are, feel proud of yourself.

Now then, what am I
going to do from now on?

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,040
I want to draw out my own story.

80
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,120
But I must also earn money...

81
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,160
and learn more.

82
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,800

No.

00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,360
That is why I feel grateful to you.

185
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,919
Is that why you like me?

186
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,279
I want to be hugged by you every day.

187
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,240
I want to listen to your
heartbeat every day.

188
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,559
My heart melts whenever I'm with you.

189
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
You're truly warm.

190
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,919
Other than them, I
can't do anything for you.

191
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
So what?

192
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,360
I have nothing, either.

193
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,759
If you're fine with how I am,

194
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,440
why don't we,

195
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,360
two poor people, try
to live life to the fullest?

196
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,960
Stop talking.

197
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,080
Why?

198
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,720
Weren't these things supposed to be felt?

199
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,960
But why can't you feel me?

200
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,000
You like me a lot, don't you?

201
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,840
Though I have nothing right now,

202
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,639
I must tell you this. Okay?

203
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,080
I can love you forever.

204
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,080
All other women are rocks.

205
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,080
You're my only deity.

206
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,799
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

207
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,650
Can we stay here like this?

208
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,079
What were you here for?

209
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,680
It's okay. I found it?

210
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,480
Found what?

211
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Right.

212
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,079
Hey.

213
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,170
- Listen.
- What?

214
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,840
My plan was to become your
ideal Prince Charming again...

215
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,890
and propose to you.

216
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,799
Gosh.

217
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,239
But you're more charming
than Prince Charming.

218
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,279
Really?

219
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,319
Won't you regret it?

220
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,079
As someone said, I decided to live
as a Prince Charming-like warrior.

221
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,599
Goodness. Why are you this lovely?

222
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:25,799
After all this time?

223
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,890
No. Ever since we first met.

224
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,200
It took such a long
time for me to say this.

225
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,410
I love you, Shin Jae Rim.

226
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I love you, too.

227
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,890
You didn't have any proper meals, right?

228
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,210
It'll be my treat. Go ahead
and order everything you want.

229
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,359
Then I'll get...

230
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,650
plump shrimp.

231
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,119
And the original is the
best, so the supreme.

232
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,679
I'll get Hawaiian and sweet potato.

233
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm paying for them.

234
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,650
- Thank you for the food.
- Dig in.

235
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,000
The pizza here is delicious.

236
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,079
It's so good.

237
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,558
What's going on?

238
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,038
Guys, come! Hurry up!

239
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,839
That thing went inside! Hurry!

240
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,410
I'm back.

241
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,680
Mom. What's that?

242
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,720
I don't think he's human.

243
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,650
He's too good-looking.

244
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,410
I brought him since he
needed a place to crash tonight.

245
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,440
Good evening.

246
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,079
- I'm Jae Rim's boyfriend.
- My gosh.

247
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,890
Goodness gracious.

248
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
I didn't know my youngest daughter...

249
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,720
was blessed with a great guy.

250
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,759
That's nonsense. He doesn't
even have a place to sleep.

251
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,479
She picked up a bum from somewhere.

252
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,169
He used to be the CEO of Chungdam Heaven...

253
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,799
but got kicked out overnight, okay?

254
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,479
Oh, so he went from riches to rags.

255
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,679
Mind your manners, will you?

256
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
(From riches to rags)

257
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,119
Well, welcome.

258
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,119
You sure are a very handsome guy.

259
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,079
- What about dinner?
- We had some.

260
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,599
He's only going to spend the night here.

261
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,799
"Only going to spend the night here?"

262
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,650
Yes.

263
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,359
Goodness, I feel sleepy.

264
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,479
- I should go to bed now.
- Okay.

265
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,278
- Goodnight.
- Let's all go to sleep.

266
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,409
- What?
- No way.

267
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,039
We should finish this show.

268
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,279
Why don't you read a book for our Pumpkin?

269
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,519
Do we have books at our house?

270
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,170
It hurts.

271
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,960
She's a silly girl.

272
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,279
Here.

273
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,839
(Shin Kwang Soo)

274
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,519
We actually swapped places to sleep.

275
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
Will you be able to sleep?

276
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,000
- You think?
- Is it uncomfortable?

277
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,319
Of course. You're right next to me.

278
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,319
Is that so? Then I'm going
to my room. Goodnight.

279
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,890
I wonder if I should
be staying still like this.

280
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,170
If not, what will you do?

281
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,400
Cha Min!

282
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,920
Someone will see us.

283
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,880
- They're probably asleep.
- Come here.

284
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,559
Forget it.

285
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,440
Should we go to my place?

286
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,519
But aren't you homeless now?

287
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,119
Because of the Tenant
Protection Act, it's still my house.

288
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,119
Then why did you follow
me here with a pitiful face?

289
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,599
Because I wanted to follow you around.

290
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,200
I missed you tons, you know?

291
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,318
You should've told me.

292
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,519
Let's go to your place.

293
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,880
No. Scratch that.

294
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,559
How come?

295
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,079
Go home, and it'll get
dangerous. I'll break loose.

296
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,920
Can't you just break loose?

297
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,359
What's going to happen? Show me.

298
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,400
Give me time.

299
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,680
I'll become a cooler man,
and take you with me like a VIP.

300
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,400
Give you time? No way.
I've got lots to do, as well.

301
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,440
Hurry up.

302
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,959
Show me what'll happen if you break loose.

303
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,960
- Come on. Show me.
- Enough. Come here.

304
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,039
I came to hold you in my
arms all night long today.

305
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,400
Wasn't I warm to you?

306
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,960
What if I hatch?

307
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,319
Go ahead.

308
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,000
And become my baby bird.

309
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
"Baby bird?"

310
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Tweet.

311
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,318
Hey, shush. The others will hear you.

312
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:57,160
- Tweet.
- Tweet.

313
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,079
They say it's always the quiet ones.

314
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,160
And it's very true with Jae Rim...

315
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,839
and the guy she brought over.

316
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
Wake up, you two.

317
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,879
Where are your manners?

318
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
As expected from my daughter.

319
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,599
I love how brazen she is.

320
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,400
What's this? Move it.

321
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,920
Wake up.

322
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,559
Sleep a bit more. We
went to bed late last night.

323
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,879
- Gosh, you...
- Sleep.

324
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Stop it.

325
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,440
We had a very peaceful night.

326
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,839
Is that so?

327
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,839
Wake up. Hurry.

328
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,279
- Get up.
- Why? What is it?

329
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,319
Did you sleep well, tweet?

330
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,640
My gosh.

331
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,960
What is it? Does it stink too much?

332
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,920
Why did you have to make cheonggukjang?

333
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
No.

334
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,359
This is my favourite dish.

335
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,598
Rich people find this
kind of dish amusing...

336
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,720
and intolerable in dramas.

337
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,518
Even people like Jae
Yong eat fried seaweed rolls,

338
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,679
and Yong Jin has rice with
instant noodles these days.

339
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Oh, my.

340
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,519
But I made it so you couldn't eat it.

341
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Please dig in.

342
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,319
Eat lots.

343
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,839
It's hot.

344
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,160
I wonder if my son is eating properly.

345
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,440
Leave.

346
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,598
I told you we cut ties, didn't I?

347
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,559
You know I don't take back my words.

348
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
I don't need you anymore, Dad.

349
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,240
Then what are you here for?

350
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,279
Remember you said love didn't exist?

351
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,039
But it does.

352
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,279
I love you.

353
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
And all of this is out of
your love for me, right?

354
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,599
We're an exception.

355
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,200
You're right.

356
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,959
Since we've cut ties,

357
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,839
I will live happily
ever after with my girl.

358
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,759
Don't be ridiculous.

359
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,680
Although I was kicked
out with nothing but myself,

360
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,039
she accepted me.

361
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,559
Being handsome is truly
the best. Thanks, Dad.

362
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,439
I had full faith in my
looks, too, you know?

363
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,079
But it's all an illusion.
It's nothing but a shell.

364
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,200
Leave. Empty out your house.

365
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,960
I wanted to do something
proper before leaving.

366
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,480
That's why I'm here.

367
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,079
What is it?

368
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
I've already been kicked out.

369
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,758
I had nothing to lose,
so I brought Mom here.

370
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,879
You punk. I told you not
to trust that sly woman.

371
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,758
"Trust?" That's so old-fashioned.

372
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,680
Just enjoy the moment as you want.

373
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,359
Don't you want to spend your
day happily with the one you like?

374
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,119
You should decide...

375
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,319
on the kind of life you want to live.

376
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,119
Cha Min...

377
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Honey?

378
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,720
Don't say a thing.

379
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,119
Hey...

380
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,240
Love is something you must feel.

381
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,318
I've never seen such a laid back,
jobless person in my life before.

382
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,079
Don't nag at me. You never
know what'll become of me.

383
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,000
And right now, I'm
cultivating my sensibility.

384
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
Right. I so want to know what
you'll become in the future.

385
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Hold on.

386
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,679
Didn't you get...

387
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,440
criticized a lot for paying
to make a wish in the past?

388
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,200
Yes. I did.

389
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,999
So, did that wish come true?

390
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,359
You got yourself a boyfriend.

391
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,558
I'm not sure.

392
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,559
I never wished for Moon Cha Min.

393
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,559
He was a total jerk back then.

394
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,680
Listen, Jae Rim. Despite
everything, your CEO is good-looking.

395
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,318
- Right.
- He looks like...

396
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,759
he has the most perfect abs.

397
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,079
I felt it a bit.

398
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,400
And he most likely does.

399
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,160
It's just as you had wished!

400
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,440
But being penniless is fatal.

401
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,240
I'll be the breadwinner.

402
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,759
You've got scammed.

403
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,639
From what I see, that rich girl...

404
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,759
made a fool of you to screw you over.

405
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Gosh. What a wicked girl. She
knows nothing about a commoner's life.

406
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,558
You're wrong. I believe I
received a much better gift...

407
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,039
that suits me much more
than what I had wished for.

408
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,400
(Wish Pavilion)

409
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,319
You see,

410
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,960
I want a loyal guy like a Korean Jindo dog.

411
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,599
He should only have eyes on me.

412
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,559
Are you fine with one who's ugly?

413
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,680
Not really.

414
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,959
(Shin Jae Rim)

415
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
"Shin Jae Rim?"

416
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, gosh.

417
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,118
Goodness.

418
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,880
I only gave her the paper with
her wish and not the talisman.

419
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,038
What now?

420
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,400
It's up to her fate now.

421
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,759
Don't forget yours, okay?

422
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,440
Can you really make my wish come true?

423
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,680
Actually, it's a trade secret.

424
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,200
A secret.

425
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,959
Wishes come true through one's faith, will,

426
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,599
- What? You're weird.
- And how the world unrolls.

427
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,439
Nobody knows what kind of a story...

428
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,216
- one will write together.
- Are you leaving?

429
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Bye!

430
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,919
Hey, Dad.

431
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,599
Come back, Cha Min. You
need to take over my business.

432
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,038
Your dad is old now.

433
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,159
I don't work with someone
who takes back their words.

434
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,359
And there are plenty
who want to invest in me.

435
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,119
I'm going to open Seongsu Heaven.

436
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,719
I was being childish. Come back.

437
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,839
No way.

438
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,439
I may have played hooky,

439
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,200
but apparently, I'm very competent.

440
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,920
I've got all the skills.

441
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,680
So this time,

442
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,518
I'm going to become Prince
Charming without help.

443
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,960
Let me be your Prince Charming.

444
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,680
Chungdam Heaven will be all yours.

445
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,759
Stop being so cold-hearted
to your dad, Cha Min.

446
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,000
She's right. I want to
follow my joy at ease now.

447
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,759
So, it's time for you to work,

448
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,439
and time for me to love.

449
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,519
Then why don't you offer a
contract where I'm the ultimate boss?

450
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,039
Follow your joy.

451
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,960
Do as you please, punk.

452
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Hello?

453
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:48,920
Hi. I'm Producer Seong Eun from Channel EJ.

454
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,558
Are you Ms. Shin Jae Rim?

455
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes. How can I help you?

456
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,639
I thoroughly enjoyed...

457
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,480
Director Baek Do Hong's
collection of scripts,

458
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,839
and it so happened to be your story.

459
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,479
Oh, you see...

460
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,960
I let my imagination take
over and not stick to the script.

461
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I kept getting sidetracked while drawing,

462
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,279
like Little Red Riding Hood.

463
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,839
But that was what I liked.

464
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,240
It was unique and kitsch.

465
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,720
Coincidentally, I plan to
create a short-form animation.

466
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,079
How about we work together?

467
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,799
Is this the so-called lucky draw?

468
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,720
Are you free this Friday?

469
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,519
Of...

470
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,640
I already have plans but I
will try to make some time.

471
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,480
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

472
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,480
Oh, my gosh.

473
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,599
Can things work out like this?

474
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,679
Yes. This universe is
surprisingly close-knit...

475
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,079
and endless.

476
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,680
Hi. The weather is amazing, right?

477
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,879
Apparently, this universe
has an exquisite fate...

478
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,680
and profound gifts for us.

(Tweet)

481
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
- Hey, Tweet.
- I miss you.

482
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,359
I'm on my way.

483
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,480
Dad, I can sort of understand
what you meant by...

484
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,559
you can't become successful alone.

485
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,160
Had I not met you,

486
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,559
I wouldn't have encountered...

487
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,200
such a self and this day.

488
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,679
(6 months later)

489
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,119
(Hanyang University Hospital)

490
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,769
It's so strange to give birth...

491
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,119
in front of my kids.

492
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,239
Push just a bit more, Mom.

493
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,159
My stomach hurts too much.

494
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,769
I brought this from home
to cheer you up, Mom.

495
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,559
Shin Kwang Soo. How
dare you laugh right now?

496
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,769
Really, how dare you?

497
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,360
You're extremely ugly today.

498
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,079
Get lost.

499
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
- Get lost!
- Put it away.

500
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,559
Mom. Relax.

501
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,080
It'll be the first time Pumpkin
comes out to the world.

502
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,679
Push, ma'am.

503
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,289
In 1, 2, 3.

504
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,519
Shin Kwang Soo!

505
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,289
Congratulations.

506
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,679
It's a girl.

507
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,400
Because the world is a tough place,

508
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,599
being born might feel unfair.

509
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,638
Despite all, there are
dazzling and tearful moments...

510
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,598
like light and salt...

511
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,920
that make you feel grateful to be born.

512
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,079
So happily hang in there.

513
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,519
My dream of becoming a career
woman has finally come true.

514
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,559
However, that's my imagination.

515
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,519
This is what reality looks like.

516
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Hey.

517
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,599
Your shoulders are really stiff.

518
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,840
It feels nice.

519
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,329
But, you see,

520
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,679
my legs hurt more because
I've been sitting down all day.

521
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Here.

522
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,960
Even if he is Prince Cha Min,

523
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,880
he becomes a slave before the one he loves.

524
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:46,840
It feels nice.

525
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,159
Why aren't you like Cinderella?

526
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,920
You have no time to hang out with me.

527
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,039
Why don't you take life easily again?

528
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,239
Follow your joy.

529
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,639
But you're my joy.

530
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,519
Just once.

531
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,639
How shall I entertain you?

532
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,559
Must you ask?

533
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,199
- I'll do as I want.
- Okay.

534
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:50,719
They're doing something
else that is far from...

535
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,199
the reason she got her studio.

536
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,840
Shouldn't you work?

537
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,769
Weren't you going to
live life to the fullest?

538
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,769
(Chungdam Heaven)

539
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,809
The short-form video is much
more popular than expected.

540
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,559
Jae Rim. Isn't this all thanks to me?

541
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,360
I was the middleman.

542
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,039
Be nice to me.

543
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:18,289
Got it.

544
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,960
To be accurate, it was thanks to me.

545
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,239
I gave her a good massage
whenever she had it hard.

546
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,000
And I did, no matter how
tired or exhausted I was.

547
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,639
My coffee did wonders, too.

548
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,880
My bread, as well.

549
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,289
Jae Rim. You're really lucky.

550
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,719
Shall we all have a look at this?

551
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
Regardless of what the world says,

552
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:56,880
keep in mind that you are
the main character of your life...

553
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,769
and create your own story.

554
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,039
Then, misery simply
becomes a page of your story.

555
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,519
Your villain becomes
a supporting character.

556
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,039
Everything will be for
the sake of your dream.

557
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,809
And eventually,

558
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,480
it'll end happily ever after.
