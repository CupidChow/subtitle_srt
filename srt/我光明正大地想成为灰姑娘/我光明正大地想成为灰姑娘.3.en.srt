1
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:12,096
DREAMING OF FREAKING FAIRY TALE

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,894
The god of love
is like a four-year-old,

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,397
so you never know
what he'll do.

4
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,983
So you can never guess

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,987
who will meet and
how they will fall in love.

6
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,574
Agh!

7
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,287
Cupid is quite capricious,

8
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,664
but there's one
good thing about him.

9
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,960
Hey! You can be loved, too!

10
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,507
Capricious Cupid...

11
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,843
bring it on!

12
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:58,392
Oh, he's your honey.

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,355
I should go.

14
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,359
Hey, wait...

15
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,365
Honey,

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,910
I came all the way here for you.

17
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,329
Yeah. Why did you?

18
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,372
It's exhausting for both of us.

19
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,874
Exhausting?

20
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,709
I know getting engaged
was a strategic move,

21
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,753
but you need to make it
look convincing.

22
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,379
When I call you,
you better answer quick!

23
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,840
Why? I'm not
your honorary firefighter.

24
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,008
How dare you!

25
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,470
Since we pledged
a lifelong engagement

26
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,472
to ensure the freedom of
unmarried life for each of us,

27
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,016
you must fulfill the duties
that come with it, jerk.

28
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,811
Why is this a duty?
Do I look like I'm free?

29
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,522
You're getting worse
by the minute.

30
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,689
If you meet some woman

31
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,316
and end up breaking
our engagement,

32
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,484
you'll be beyond sorry.

33
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,319
The trouble won't end
with our companies.

34
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,614
What if my graceful image

35
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,115
gets tarnished?

36
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,577
This is me making sure
that never happens.

37
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,704
With that temperament of yours,

38
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,581
you'd make a terrible bride.

39
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,209
Don't be ridiculous.

40
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,670
I've been training to be
a good bride for five years now.

41
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:10,464
I can julienne onions
with my eyes closed.

42
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,466
If you don't
answer my call again,

43
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,553
I'm gonna pretend
your head is an avocado

44
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,931
and pit you with a spoon.

45
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:26,689
He acted like
he's never getting married

46
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,441
when he's actually engaged?

47
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,611
What a weirdo.

48
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,116
What's his deal?

49
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,577
What is his deal?

50
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,330
I was just talking to myself.
Go back to sleep.

51
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,999
I thought
you were talking to me.

52
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,754
Men would do anything
to hit on a woman.

53
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,551
Why would he hit on me?
Just go back to sleep.

54
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,595
-Who knows, moron?
-Ouch.

55
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,221
Some have
a peculiar taste in women.

56
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,807
-Darn it.
-Don't be so naive.

57
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,142
Naive?

58
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,019
I'm very experienced.

59
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,942
You don't understand
how huge the world really is.

60
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,615
As if you do.

61
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,048
How come he's so muscular?

62
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,134
Just how much did he work out?

63
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,680
So firm.

64
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,818
It's too hot.

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,821
I need to sleep.

66
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,468
Sweetheart, run faster.

67
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,388
Sweetheart, run faster.

68
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,018
Sweetheart,

69
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,395
run faster.

70
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,319
It turns out
our Prince Cha-min

71
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,823
is a red-blooded man, too.

72
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,245
How did you get
the job so out of the blue?

73
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,955
You said the CEO was nuts.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,915
I don't know.
He said I'm entertaining.

75
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,377
Do you think I'm good
at being funny?

76
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,213
If you were funny,
you'd be a comedian.

77
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,884
Right, I could've been
a beautiful comedian.

78
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,138
Dream on.

79
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,515
You're not
pretty enough to be one.

80
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,017
The competition is cutthroat.

81
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,354
He must have felt a kind
of culture shock from you.

82
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,648
He's an upper-class gentleman.

83
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,277
I wish I could make enough
money to join Chungdam Heaven

84
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,154
and experience
culture shock too.

85
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,448
Aren't you making
money with that new gig?

86
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,908
"Getting Naughty
with Tom Black."

87
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,744
I did an amazing
job recording it.

88
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,495
I took moaning
to the next level.

89
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,624
I was totally sexy
when I recorded it,

90
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,296
-but it's not really paying off.
-Oh, that's terrible.

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,715
Please watch
my audiobook videos

92
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,051
so the extra views
will make me get recommended.

93
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,136
That's not my cup of tea.

94
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,931
But for you,
I will press the like button.

95
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,601
Watch it. It's good.

96
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,352
Oh, Black,

97
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,105
-Hey, don't. Okay, stop.
-That's the spot.

98
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,774
Oh, seriously.

99
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,488
Whoa, why is she so good?

100
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,466
The ink you ground for me
improves my writing,

101
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,134
my dear child.

102
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,305
-How do you like it?
-It looks so beautiful...

103
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,558
that a butterfly
might soon appear.

104
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,812
I want to retire and enjoy
the second stage of my life

105
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,648
painting like this.

106
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,400
You should, Father.

107
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,989
You met a nice man,

108
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,325
and the company is doing well.

109
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,871
I think it's about time
Cha-min takes over.

110
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,874
When will the wedding be?

111
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,172
Father?

112
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,803
I would hate to get angry.

113
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,681
Of course, you should stay calm.

114
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,015
You can do it!

115
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,352
If I threw a hissy fit
like a crazy girl,

116
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,646
who would be the most upset?

117
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,232
-Me?
-Wrong.

118
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,235
I would be the most upset.

119
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,529
Profanities coming
out of these lovely lips

120
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,407
and my angelic voice cracking up

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,243
would bring tragedy
into my beautiful life.

122
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,914
So, don't make me repeat myself.

123
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,708
What did I tell you?

124
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,626
Moon Cha-min is
your anti-marriage partner.

125
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,045
You will never get married.

126
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,840
Just because I look
elegant on the outside,

127
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,425
don't make the mistake
of thinking my personality

128
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,635
has changed, too. It is all...

129
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,056
in our blood, in our DNA.

130
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,064
Dan-ah, you'll hurt yourself.

131
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,443
Let it go.

132
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,195
Breathe and let it go.

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,114
It's okay. Stop! Stop, stop.

134
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
You'll hurt yourself.

135
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,910
That's good, that's enough.

136
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,807
Hey! Pants wetter!

137
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,978
Don't you know how to say hi?

138
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,397
I didn't wet my pants.

139
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,316
If it hadn't been for me,
you would have.

140
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,653
Who knows?
I always do Kegel exercises.

141
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,489
Oh, did you have to go that far?

142
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,657
You could've just thanked me.

143
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,743
It seems like you're
dying to hear that from me.

144
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,162
Of course.
My entire body aches right now.

145
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,206
I meant to thank you last night.

146
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,667
I couldn't only
because your fiancee showed up.

147
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,002
Why didn't you tell me
about being engaged?

148
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,129
Were you planning on making a
move if I didn't have a fiancee?

149
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,049
You won't succeed.

150
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,218
There's no way
I will fall for you,

151
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,970
especially
when I know your goal.

152
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,306
How hilarious.

153
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,559
It's not like that.

154
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,688
It's just that you acted
like you're the kind of man

155
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,148
who doesn't
believe in people or in love

156
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:26,817
and would
never ever get married.

157
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,111
And as for me, I could never
fall for a nutcase like you.

158
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,696
The reason why
you got a job here

159
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,073
is because the CEO is a nutcase.

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,825
Right, because
you're a nutcase...

161
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,541
Thank you.

162
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,502
I don't mind
working for a nutcase boss,

163
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,046
but I'm never going
to date a nutcase man,

164
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,172
no matter how desperate I get.

165
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,267
Incredible.

166
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,352
So you did
manage to get a job here.

167
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,146
Yes, thankfully.

168
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,399
I have a lot to learn,
so please help me.

169
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,234
I have a lot to learn,
too, so it's okay.

170
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,322
Let me tell you what kind
of place this is first.

171
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,407
Okay. I've been curious

172
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:20,162
about the social club
only the rich people can join.

173
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,496
I was wondering

174
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,333
if I could speak
casually with you

175
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,876
because being formal is tiring.

176
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,838
Good idea.

177
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,343
PLAYGROUND

178
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,597
Think of this as a wholesome
adult version of a kids cafe.

179
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,059
Oh.

180
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,395
Having been
brought up being put through

181
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,397
so much early education,
including business management,

182
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,649
they want to unwind,
let themselves go, and play,

183
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,318
according to our boss.

184
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,612
They grew up to be
these respectable adults

185
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,489
thanks to early elite education.

186
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,408
Oh, that scared me.

187
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,370
Our boss is a human Pororo.

188
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,417
He really is Pororo.

189
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,261
SOCIAL LOUNGE

190
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,266
This is the social lounge.

191
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,188
As you can see,
we hold cultural exhibitions

192
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,648
for the members to enjoy.

193
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,983
The theme for this exhibition
is self-portraits.

194
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,487
And this one
is our boss' work.

195
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,868
That's not a self-portrait.

196
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,246
It's an umbrella portrait.

197
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,706
But that's what he called it.

198
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,585
Whoa.

199
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,338
HESSE'S GARDEN

200
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,507
They eat and play
here every day,

201
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,968
so imagine how close everyone
would get once they join.

202
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,971
No wonder this is
the center of socializing.

203
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,142
But for our boss,
it's different.

204
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,938
Wow, you're so dashing.

205
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,443
You're my dream man.
Can I have your number?

206
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,871
"Regard women as mere rocks."
That's our boss' motto.

207
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,667
No wonder he's so vicious.

208
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,212
I guess he's the kind of man
who can't fit in in heaven.

209
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,505
Right.

210
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,677
I hope you can become someone

211
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,345
who fits in very well
at Chungdam Heaven.

212
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,014
I'm serious.

213
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,265
Don't worry.

214
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,934
I can change as fast as a frog.

215
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,020
-Go for it.
-Thanks.

216
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,235
Hello.

217
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,237
Oh, you must be new.

218
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,699
-Yes, she is.
-You just started?

219
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,993
I just came out of the oven,

220
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,912
-so I'm piping hot.
-She hasn't come out yet.

221
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,207
She needs more time in the oven.

222
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,541
Let's get back

223
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,584
into the flames.

224
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,710
Flames...

225
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,920
For your training.

226
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,720
Why is my honey and that woman
walking together like that,

227
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,180
as if they are a couple?

228
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,140
You could call this
the place of true education.

229
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,475
True education?

230
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,061
I mean,
the new employee told everyone

231
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,687
that she came here to marry up.

232
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,565
Mr. Moon said
he will crush her dream

233
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,691
and teach her a lesson.

234
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,945
Why would he go that far?

235
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,988
He was with
that woman last night, too.

236
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,784
He's giving her
special attention.

237
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,957
Why are we here?

238
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,084
Are you locking me
away in a tower?

239
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,628
You're not a princess.
You're an employee.

240
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,796
I'm doing this
so you can focus on work

241
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,172
and not get any wild ideas.

242
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,716
There's no need for that.

243
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,094
I never thought of
myself as a princess.

244
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,195
-Do you see this?
-Oh, yes.

245
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,824
You have great arms...
for doing laundry.

246
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:32,497
This is the job you'll be doing.

247
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,502
Instead of this cream color,
make them look bright white.

248
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,463
But I think cream
looks more pretty.

249
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,173
It's nice and warm.

250
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,800
Don't be silly.

251
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,219
Make sure they are
as white as the first snow.

252
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,014
This is handmade Venetian lace.

253
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,766
Handwash them carefully
to avoid loose threads.

254
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:56,187
It's going to take...
ages to handwash them all.

255
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,106
Well,

256
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,108
I bet you can finish
them before you grow too old.

257
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,902
Wash this, too.

258
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,952
Oh, boy.

259
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,336
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,007
Oh, I have to do some laundry.

261
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,135
I heard
you came here to marry up.

262
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,682
Wow, word sure travels fast.

263
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,935
I won't deny my dream.

264
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,605
If you wanted to marry up,
you shouldn't have come here.

265
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,940
You should've gone to Sowondang.

266
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,234
Sowondang?

267
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,744
-Yeong-bae.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,537
Are there
any more odd jobs

269
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,539
-to do here?
-Not really.

270
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,958
You're trying to give
Jae-rim more work, aren't you?

271
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,211
Oh, please don't do that.

272
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,506
Because you are
hazing the new employee,

273
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,049
we're not getting our chance.

274
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,343
You've never done this
before, so what changed?

275
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,553
I'm going to train her hard
the way I want to.

276
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,389
Cinderella's
evil stepmother

277
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,598
isn't at her home...

278
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,809
Don't mind me
and get back to work.

279
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,311
She's at her workplace.

280
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,873
SHIN JAE-RIM

281
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,250
LIKED VIDEOS / PLAY ALL

282
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,753
MUSIC TO MAKE
TIME FLY AT WORK

283
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,256
How can I

284
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,259
Not love you?

285
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,557
I don't know, what should I do
When I look into your eyes

286
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,019
Fall for you

287
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,815
You have plentiful charms

288
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,401
How can I

289
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,529
Not love you?

290
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,910
I don't know, what should I do
When I look into your eyes

291
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,789
Fall for you

292
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,292
What is she listening to...

293
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,754
to make working so fun?

294
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,063
You have plentiful charms

295
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,608
How can I

296
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,111
Not love you?

297
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,586
The two began to discover

298
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,507
each others' bodies,

299
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,425
by only touching
and listening,

300
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,552
and soon
their passionate breaths

301
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,931
filled the entire room.

302
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,351
Tom Black, not there.

303
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:34,864
Give that back.

304
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,616
Huh?

305
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,824
You, how dare you pounce on me!

306
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,033
That's not true.

307
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,744
It's not what you're imagining.

308
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,164
You're not a bride in white.

309
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,749
You're a black-hearted pervert.

310
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,834
What the...

311
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,302
I'm not a pervert.

312
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,179
This is an audiobook
my friend recorded,

313
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,639
and it was played by accident.

314
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,849
This isn't something I'm into.

315
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,518
Blaming it
on your friend is terrible.

316
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,312
You should be proud of
what you like. I'm fine with it.

317
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,605
But I'm serious.

318
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,109
My friend is a voice actor,

319
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,819
but she couldn't
make a living from it,

320
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,987
so she got into YouTube,

321
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,196
but that's not
working out either,

322
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,615
so I have to listen
to it for her now.

323
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,075
Could you click the like button?

324
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,494
Are you saying
I have to press like too?

325
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,204
Every single like counts.

326
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:10,460
Wow, it looks like
everyone's working hard,

327
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,586
including you.

328
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,796
Me?

329
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,881
You did it.

330
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,467
I was expecting you to give up.

331
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,470
I'm a pretty good worker.

332
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,724
So I was thinking,

333
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,935
could I start doing real work?

334
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,355
No. You'll get into trouble.

335
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,023
You're really weird
for letting me work here

336
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,025
even though
you don't like me at all.

337
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,324
Right, I am weird.

338
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,373
I'm not as dangerous
as you think.

339
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,708
I'm harmless.

340
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,684
That's what y-you think.
Not me.

341
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,936
Oh, what the heck?

342
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,604
Oh, wow.

343
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,648
He's so mean.

344
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,110
GETTING NAUGHTY WITH TOM BLACK

345
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,405
"Getting Naughty
with Tom Black."

346
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,073
Oh, my heart.

347
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,710
Do you...

348
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,879
have a crush on Shin Jae-rim?

349
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,423
What are you talking about?
I'm just her boss...

350
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,216
You're not the type to worry
about your business.

351
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:42,885
Why would I have a crush on her?

352
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,429
You're being extra mean to her.

353
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,555
Like a mischievous
boy having his first crush.

354
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,806
What?

355
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,559
A m-mischievous
boy's first crush?

356
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,561
Are you insane?

357
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,187
That woman is a total pervert.

358
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,398
You already know
that much about her?

359
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,566
Hey,

360
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,027
don't you dare blame me.

361
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,032
Then prove it to me.

362
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,202
How can I prove
to you how I feel?

363
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,121
Get her out of here

364
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,497
by making her a Cinderella.

365
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,292
That would make
everyone a winner

366
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,501
and keep things interesting.

367
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,963
-You don't want to?
-Just leave her alone.

368
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,090
I don't care what
that woman becomes.

369
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,593
Really?

370
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,553
Then be nice to me

371
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,221
so I won't explode.

372
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,769
You're like
the 9:00 p.m. o'clock news.

373
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:35,104
Does that mean

374
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,148
I've become
that important to you?

375
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,525
You cause unnecessary concerns.

376
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:40,985
Please leave.

377
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,203
I was locked up all day,
doing the laundry.

378
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,331
Had I known this would happen,

379
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,625
I would've gotten a job at
a gym in the financial district

380
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,126
or at a bar outside
the courthouse

381
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,294
to look for a man.

382
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,129
Ouch,

383
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,006
my legs hurt.

384
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,342
Ouch.

385
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,141
Are you happy now that you're
working at your dream job?

386
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,392
Is it electrifying?

387
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,894
I want to get married quick.

388
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,729
You haven't learned anything.

389
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,399
Tomorrow you will wipe
all the balls in the ball pit.

390
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,692
Let's work hard.

391
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,238
Boss, what kind of work
did you do today?

392
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,823
What is Chungdam Heaven?

393
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,658
It's a place of rest
where you eat and play.

394
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,285
When I eat and play here,
it becomes symbolic,

395
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,954
and it helps promote the place.

396
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,373
You play every day,
as if you're a human Pororo.

397
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,875
There's something I always say.

398
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,670
Follow your joy.

399
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,260
Why that little...
Ugh, I can't stand him.

400
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,137
Maybe I should quit!

401
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,018
SANG-CHEOL

402
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,187
I received
the money for this month.

403
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,523
Thank you for doing this.

404
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,234
I can't keep going like this.

405
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,411
HAVE A FLOWERY DAY

406
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,665
There's only one way.

407
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,626
Sowondang?

408
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,421
Angel Shin-hye from before
got her wish after going there.

409
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,381
It's famous for making
wishes come true.

410
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,467
And it only costs
$1,000 to make it happen.

411
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,847
$1,000 to change my life.

412
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,559
It's worth risking my life.

413
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,772
The ideas we get when
we're not quite ourselves,

414
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,941
as if we were bewitched,
are usually bad ideas.

415
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,610
So be cautious.

416
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,787
What are you doing here?

417
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:58,748
You should be
celebrating your new job

418
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,916
with fried chicken and beer.

419
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,001
I need to borrow some money.

420
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,337
I'll pay you back
when I get paid.

421
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,423
Lend me one million won.

422
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,925
What do you need it for?

423
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,969
I have to make a wish.

424
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,763
Why do you need
money to make a wish?

425
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,972
Did the gods of heaven
tell you to pay them

426
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,098
to have your wish come true?

427
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,267
No, but there's this psychic
who does it for you,

428
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,186
and mysteriously,
your wish comes true.

429
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,149
That's a scam, you moron.

430
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,692
But it really came true.

431
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,696
Someone I know told me so.

432
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,490
What is the wish
you're desperate enough

433
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,824
to spend money on?

434
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,035
Marrying up.

435
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,122
Have you been possessed?

436
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,832
Pull yourself together.

437
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,252
I have pulled myself together.

438
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,836
The only solution to my
miserable life is marriage.

439
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,673
Your ideas are what's
making your life miserable.

440
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,049
What else could I do?

441
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,175
Get education?

442
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,802
What can education do for me?

443
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,845
Could it get me a job?

444
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,974
Let's say I did get a job.
Could I buy a house?

445
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,685
These days,
you can't buy a house in Seoul

446
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,729
even if you win the lottery.
This is the kind of world

447
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,356
where you can't do anything

448
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,816
unless you're
from a rich family.

449
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,026
That's why I want
to find a rich husband

450
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,612
and climb up the ladder,
so why are you criticizing me?

451
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,698
The apple didn't fall
far from Mr. Shin's tree.

452
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,199
Is that how he brought you up?

453
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,038
You're right.

454
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,459
But the two of them
loved each other.

455
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,086
Isn't that enough?

456
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,715
And... I call your mom "Mom,"

457
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,591
so why do you still
call my dad "Mr. Shin"?

458
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,552
What else
could I call Mr. Shin

459
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,012
other than "Mr. Shin"?

460
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:39,348
Forget it.

461
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,600
I don't call you
my big sister either.

462
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,937
Oh, that little...

463
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,066
HAVE A FLOWERY DAY

464
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,569
SUNGJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

465
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,165
Why did you come back?
To take more money?

466
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,583
I'm broke, so stop.

467
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,710
I came to wipe
the sleep from your eyes.

468
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,088
Oh, boy.

469
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,381
The right one.

470
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,218
Don't you ever
wash your face? Ugh.

471
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,595
-Snot.
-Seriously.

472
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,222
Your dad's snot is
too gross for you? Huh?

473
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,558
I can't take anything
from my unemployed dad.

474
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,061
You don't work
anymore, just like me.

475
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,357
If you don't marry Dan-ah,
the cooperation won't last.

476
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,359
It will last.

477
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,778
You're here
because you worry too much.

478
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,697
My advice is worth
300 million dollars.

479
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,783
-Don't forget that.
-I won't.

480
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,118
So tell me one more time to
make sure I never ever forget.

481
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:45,122
Men like us must regard women
as nothing but mere rocks.

482
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,457
Do not let your eyes wander.

483
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,878
Women are rocks.

484
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,549
Mr. Moon Bu-hyeon,
are you feeling okay?

485
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,511
Now that you're
here, I think I am.

486
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:00,846
No, no, he's fine.

487
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,973
The doctor will see you
tomorrow morning.

488
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,141
I got it.

489
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,403
Buy me more books.

490
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,072
Thorns will grow in my mouth
if I go one day without reading.

491
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,158
Why bother? You're on the same
page you were on last month.

492
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,993
This is the third time
I'm reading this.

493
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,328
Buy me something in a series.

494
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:25,913
I'm leaving.

495
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:26,997
Something untranslated.

496
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,254
I can't stop daydreaming.

497
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,386
Su-jin might agree.

498
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:45,141
Would you like something?

499
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,059
I already had
three cups of coffee.

500
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,728
-Let's get coix seed tea.
-Coix seed tea.

501
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:50,896
Sis.

502
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,398
Jae-rim.

503
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,109
What brings you here?

504
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,153
Excuse me.

505
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,989
Yes? Yes.

506
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,199
Okay. Bye.

507
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,160
I have to go.

508
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,786
Jae-rim, I'll talk to you
later at home.

509
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,372
Okay.

510
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,207
Sister-in-law. What's up?

511
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,042
You can talk to me. I got time.

512
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,419
Who are you calling
your sister-in-law?

513
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,670
Don't talk to him, okay?

514
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,297
He's full of hot air. Bye.

515
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,220
Sister-in-law,

516
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,722
I know why you came here.

517
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,976
You came
to borrow money from her, right?

518
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,603
How did you know?

519
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,022
I'm a doctor. I can tell.

520
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,523
In your eyes,
I felt the kind of desperation

521
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,941
of someone who needs money.

522
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,528
I have so much money.

523
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,156
How much do you need?

524
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:43,657
$1,000.

525
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,078
How adorable. I could
just give you that amount.

526
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,330
-Whoa.
-I could,

527
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,499
but there's a condition.

528
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,802
I want Su-jin's ring size.

529
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,679
Would you help me?

530
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,225
I want to make your big
sister fall in love with me

531
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,393
with a big diamond ring.

532
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:13,604
Help me out, please.

533
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,610
I know I saw it here.

534
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,830
This is a classic win-win.

535
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,546
Sis, stop working so hard,
trying to be the breadwinner.

536
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,799
I am all for this marriage.

537
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,824
Nice. Let's ride
this lucky wave all the way

538
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,367
to my destination.

539
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,293
Oh, my heart.

540
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,044
Wow.

541
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,015
Okay,

542
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,017
this is scary.

543
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,486
Oh.

544
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,748
Someone at Chungdam Heaven
told me about this place,

545
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,833
-so I came to make a wish.
-Oh.

546
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,544
You came from
the land of desire?

547
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,588
So?

548
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,714
What's your wish?

549
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:09,053
I want to marry up

550
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,638
and change my life.

551
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,557
Oh, you've got desires.

552
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,268
Desire of daughter.

553
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,603
Desire...

554
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,897
Oh, it's in the wrong order.
Daughter of desire.

555
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,148
Yes.

556
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,941
I have nothing to offer, but...

557
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,403
I want to be loved.

558
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,864
Actually, I want to be

559
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,575
showered with love.

560
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,619
-Showered.
-Love shower.

561
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,496
-Yes.
-Love shower, yes.

562
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,374
I want every part of
my body to be cleaned,

563
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,668
drenched with love
provided by a man

564
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,419
who is way out of my league.

565
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,339
Could I ever be loved like that?

566
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,134
I thought I might be
able to be somebody

567
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,720
if I am loved
by somebody amazing,

568
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,931
even though I'm a nobody now...

569
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,560
-It's possible.
-Really?

570
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,480
Anyone and everyone can love.

571
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,774
Love doesn't pick and choose.

572
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,651
-Why is that?
-I mean...

573
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,780
Cupid must be
nearsighted or something

574
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,325
because he has bad aim.

575
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,536
Cupid?

576
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,802
The two began to discover

577
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:35,305
each others' bodies,

578
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,558
by only touching
and listening,

579
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,102
and soon
their passionate breaths

580
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,604
filled the entire room.

581
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,150
Tom Black, not there.

582
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,573
What the...

583
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,533
This is terrible.

584
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,619
Do you...

585
00:33:58,829 --> 00:33:59,997
have a crush on Shin Jae-rim?

586
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,460
Why would I,
unless I'm crazy? Huh?

587
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,295
She's not attractive at all.

588
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,807
SEXY, PROVOCATIVE

589
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,028
Shin Jae-rim.

590
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,530
She's dangerous.

591
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,199
She is.

592
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:42,456
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

593
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,458
So, did you get the money?

594
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,170
Stay out of it.

595
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,047
You didn't lend me any money.

596
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,840
Jae-rim, do you need money?

597
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,801
Since you're doing
the cooking in my place,

598
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,177
would you like
some spending money?

599
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,013
No, it's okay.

600
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,389
You should spend it on yourself.

601
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,766
Did anyone see my ring?

602
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,352
Is it gold?

603
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,853
Could I sell it?

604
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,730
No, it's a silver ring.

605
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,857
I didn't want it to get rusty,

606
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,567
but it's gone.

607
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,736
-Jae-rim.
-Yes?

608
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,405
What did you want
to talk about last night?

609
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:19,493
Oh!

610
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,746
It was nothing.

611
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,666
I should go get ready.
Enjoy your food.

612
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,547
Mom,
give me some spending money.

613
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,715
You're nuts.

614
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,607
Oh, boy,

615
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,818
did you come to work
this early to stir up trouble?

616
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,903
Stir up trouble?

617
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,030
I came early
to wipe all the balls.

618
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,949
I didn't want to get locked up
in a room all day again.

619
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,661
You can start
your regular duties today.

620
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,541
-Why all of a sudden?
-Just because

621
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,751
you want to marry up doesn't
mean it will actually happen.

622
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,045
I had no reason to be
concerned in the first place.

623
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,381
I doubt you can marry up.

624
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,302
You think I can't do it?

625
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,981
Our Prince Cha-min

626
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,568
has been fighting
his urges for so long

627
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,737
that even a minor
stimulation from Jae-rim

628
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,156
is turning him
into a mola mola.

629
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,997
Please stop, you know,

630
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,206
invading my personal space.

631
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,499
Well, I didn't,

632
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,460
I never really invaded
your personal space.

633
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,463
You smell.

634
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,219
Stay far away from me, please.

635
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,934
Why does she keep
invading my personal space?

636
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,021
Oh, seriously!

637
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,621
What's going on?

638
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,831
I can't smell anything.

639
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,502
Wait,

640
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,254
is it the smell of poverty

641
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,590
only the rich can smell?

642
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,011
Darn it.

643
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,315
Whoa,

644
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,275
this is the smell of wealth.

645
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,117
Darn it,

646
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,452
I do smell

647
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,621
like poverty.

648
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:18,839
What are you doing?

649
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,048
-Huh?
-Nosework training?

650
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,258
Do I smell?

651
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,678
-No, you don't.
-I don't?

652
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,100
-You didn't take a shower?
-I did.

653
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,226
You didn't.

654
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,728
-I did.
-You didn't.

655
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,895
I said I did.

656
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,272
Seriously.

657
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,485
I got mistreated
for smelling when I don't.

658
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,738
How can he be
so mean to a woman?

659
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,157
Bring your wish note with you

660
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,616
and read it whenever
you get the chance.

661
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,873
You need
to imprint it on your mind.

662
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,171
And that clear
goal will lead you

663
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,798
to the destiny you want.

664
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,815
A BIG MAN! BE IT
HIS HEIGHT OR WHATEVER,

665
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,985
I WANT HIM TO BE BIG...

666
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,739
The more vivid
the wish is, the better.

667
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,579
What kind of man do you want?

668
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,170
Picture your ideal man
in your head.

669
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,466
In order for me
to picture him,

670
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,512
it should be about
his appearance, right?

671
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,683
A big man.

672
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,311
Especially his height.

673
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:59,856
Why does my heart skip a beat
whenever I see a big man?

674
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,234
When I look up at a tall man,

675
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,985
I can stretch
and relieve my text neck.

676
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,029
It makes me so happy.

677
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,533
I wouldn't have
to ask who his father is

678
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,034
because his facial features

679
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,202
would be so sharp
that they say

680
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,538
they were sculpted
by Michelangelo.

681
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,172
And six-pack abs.

682
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,342
They say your core
muscles are important.

683
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,511
It is a topsy-turvy world,

684
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,722
so I'm going to hold onto him
tightly and never waver.

685
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,898
Cupid's reckless
shooting of arrows

686
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,693
leads to complicated
relationships.

687
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,657
But after twists and turns,

688
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,368
you will most certainly

689
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,621
find true love.
