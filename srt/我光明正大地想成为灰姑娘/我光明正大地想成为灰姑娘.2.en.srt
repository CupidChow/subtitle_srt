1
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,221
DREAMING OF FREAKING FAIRY TALE

2
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:19,061
All fairy-tale princes are
rich, handsome and sweet.

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,772
They are all very similar,

4
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,108
as if they were cloned
from one prince.

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,736
But being born
into a rich family

6
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,446
doesn't always guarantee

7
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,865
a sunny disposition
and a kind heart.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,658
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

9
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,786
who's the handsomest
of them all?

10
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,998
You are, of course, Prince.

11
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,880
If you're lying, I'll smash you.

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,758
There's also a gen Z,

13
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,553
8th-gen, conglomerate family
prince who's nuts.

14
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,513
Let's begin the romance story

15
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,058
of the 8th generation
conglomerate family prince.

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,394
I'm going to sue you.

17
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:05,816
For attempted murder.

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,988
"Attempted murder?"

19
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,330
Darn it.

20
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,170
What the heck is this?

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,513
You're after my money,
aren't you?

22
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,142
I, I don't even know
how much money you have.

23
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,519
It's immeasurable

24
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,438
because it's increasing
as we speak from interest.

25
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,606
So instead of using
dirty tricks like this,

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,483
just come out and ask for money.

27
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,109
Why would I?

28
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,570
I'm more scared of dying than
anything in the entire world.

29
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,571
There are so many things
to enjoy in life,

30
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,323
but if I'm dead,
I can't enjoy them.

31
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,449
He's crazy.

32
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:59,370
I shouldn't get mixed up
with him.

33
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,707
Okay, I am very sorry,
but it was an accident.

34
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,209
Let me have my shoe back.

35
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,211
I can't give you the evidence.

36
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:08,921
Why do you need evidence?

37
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,465
-I told you it wasn't so.
-I don't believe you.

38
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,133
A perfectly fine shoe came off

39
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,510
and fell right
on top of my head?

40
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,263
How can something like that
happen without intent?

41
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,722
You totally did it on purpose.

42
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,183
That's what people generally
call an unfortunate accident.

43
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,394
If bird poop
hits you on the street,

44
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,229
do you blame the bird
for holding a grudge?

45
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,815
I'm not that unlucky.

46
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,650
Luck is on my side.

47
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,694
You're not that lucky.

48
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,112
I said it was an accident.

49
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,572
Give me back my shoe.

50
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:35,948
Really?

51
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,950
Don't you have any manners?

52
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,660
I guess I don't.

53
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,745
So give it to me.

54
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,748
No, never.
I'm going to get this resolved.

55
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,084
No mercy.

56
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,005
If you keep this up,
it won't end well.

57
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,257
For me or for you?

58
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,550
For both of us.

59
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,844
I have the worst luck,
so if you mess with me,

60
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,596
my bad luck
will rub off on you, too.

61
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,264
Do you want to be miserable?

62
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:02,933
This is intent.

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,585
And this is good will.

64
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,297
I saved your life.

65
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,428
The hour hand met
the minute hand,

66
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,973
striking 12 o'clock,
as two strangers met,

67
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,684
the beginning of new magic.

68
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,773
How could he take a shoe

69
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,485
from someone who's
about to have a job interview?

70
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,031
But, Shin Jae-rim,

71
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,534
you need to be nice to the rude,
rich people from now on.

72
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,535
Relax.

73
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,373
I am an Angel Manager.

74
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,421
From this moment on, smile.

75
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,265
CEO MOON CHA-MIN

76
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,606
Wow.

77
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,109
What just walked in?

78
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,027
I thought you were
Satan without wings.

79
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,782
RESUME

80
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,534
Oh, you're here
for the interview.

81
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,576
I'm sorry,

82
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,787
but only a kind person
can be an angel.

83
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,206
The job involves
connecting people,

84
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,710
and a mean person
will make it fail.

85
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,466
Huh?

86
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,468
What's going on?

87
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,513
Why are you quiet?

88
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,390
You were quite chatty earlier.

89
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,644
If there's anything you
want to say, go ahead.

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,898
Does it feel good

91
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,067
to be the boss
and talk to me this way?

92
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,945
It's the best.
It's electrifying.

93
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:22,489
Then...

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,453
What if I prayed?

95
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,664
You said you're
scared of dying, right?

96
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,585
In what will be
a rather short life of yours,

97
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,171
I pray that you
will never be able to buy

98
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,758
any amount of happiness
with all that money you have.

99
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,555
I was really desperate
for this job.

100
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,598
So it wouldn't be fair

101
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,807
if you are the only one
who gets to be happy.

102
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,643
Then...

103
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,437
what do you want?

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,648
Lightning shall strike
the top of your head

105
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,484
and come out of your ass!

106
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,992
When an animal's life
is at stake,

107
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,869
they instinctively
put up a fight.

108
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,997
A zebra will kick a predator
with its hind legs,

109
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,210
A piglet will roar at a lion.

110
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,145
And at this moment, Jae-rim,
with her indomitable spirit,

111
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,815
gave Cha-min a verbal slap.

112
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,706
By the way, what's the deal
with that umbrella?

113
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,542
Is it like a security blanket?

114
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,253
He suffers from
the "watch your six" syndrome.

115
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,506
So he uses that umbrella to be
on alert and protect himself.

116
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,384
How can that protect him?

117
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,677
Who knows?

118
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,889
Maybe there's a weapon
hidden inside that umbrella.

119
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,019
How can the CEO be that young?

120
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:21,233
He's young and rich,
but I'm young and poor.

121
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:26,113
He's the weird one
for being rich when he's young.

122
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,739
It's unfair.

123
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,368
I'm young, so I should shine,

124
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,164
but I feel small and miserable
because I'm poor.

125
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,626
You've been good
and hard-working,

126
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,212
and one day you meet
the love of your life.

127
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,047
And he turns out to be rich.

128
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,218
I wonder if anything like this
could happen to us.

129
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,686
Even if you ran big data
analyses on our lives,

130
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,354
it wouldn't happen.

131
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,898
People like us have to fight

132
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,610
for chances like that
with all we got.

133
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,824
Oh, I can't stand that man.

134
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,994
Aren't they watching up
in heaven?

135
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,370
They should strike him

136
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,957
with lightning, rumble,
boom, bang!

137
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,667
Like this, you know?

138
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,423
Lightning shall strike
the top of your head

139
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,383
and come out of your ass!

140
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,057
Ugh, the trauma.

141
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,212
I saved your life.

142
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,930
Have you finally gone crazy?

143
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,098
What's wrong?

144
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,686
I met this woman, but...

145
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,188
it was very weird.

146
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,358
Wait, did she slap you?

147
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,985
My ears did feel numb.

148
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,863
When rich people like us
get slapped, we can't help

149
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:32,823
but fall for the girl.

150
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,659
Fall for the girl? Me?

151
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,494
Don't be ridiculous.

152
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,083
What? Fall for her?

153
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,964
There's no way
I can be attracted to her.

154
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,466
Peekaboo.

155
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:54,886
What are you doing?

156
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,479
No.

157
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,200
Go away.

158
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,577
Go away.

159
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,551
He told me to regard women
as nothing but rocks.

160
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,261
She's a rock, a rock.

161
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,140
Okay.

162
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,060
One.

163
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,229
Rock.

164
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,443
What rock? Jae-rim rock?

165
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,617
Oh, this is driving me crazy.

166
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,103
I must have lost my mind.

167
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,730
Why does she keep appearing?

168
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,788
Oh, this is nuts.

169
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,382
Oh, seriously.

170
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,675
Man.

171
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,180
Huh?

172
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:05,851
Oh, seriously.

173
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,686
Darn it.

174
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,274
Ugh.

175
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,453
She isn't much to look at.

176
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,872
What kind of trick
did she play on me?

177
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,874
Could it be...

178
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,169
hypnosis?

179
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,931
Cold brew, cold brew.

180
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,893
Turn into a delicious latte.

181
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,145
Ha!

182
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,238
Whoa! Magic.

183
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,324
This is nice.

184
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,544
HEALTH INSURANCE
PAYMENT PAST DUE

185
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,714
Paying for insurance
is killing me.

186
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,008
INFO ABOUT INTEREST

187
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,218
ON UNPAID STUDENT LOANS
AFTER FINDING A JOB

188
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,845
My part-time job pays peanuts,
and it's already gone.

189
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,158
Hello? Who is this?

190
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,577
This is Moon Cha-min,
CEO of Chungdam Heaven.

191
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,040
Why are you calling me
on such a fine morning?

192
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,001
So I can have you come early
to Chungdam Heaven.

193
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,962
Are you still at it?

194
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,339
It was a mistake,
and I apologized.

195
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,591
Are you a pervert
who enjoys hearing profanities?

196
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,676
Do I need to get warmed up?

197
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:09,599
Sure, do it in front of me,
face to face.

198
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,521
I don't want to get involved
with you ever again.

199
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,231
Oh, is that so?

200
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, that's unfortunate.

201
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,819
I was calling to tell you
that you got the job.

202
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:21,987
What?

203
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,323
What are you trying to do?

204
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,908
Are you planning
on torturing me?

205
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,661
I wouldn't dare, considering all
the curses you might put on me.

206
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,079
I almost thought
you were Jang Hui-bin.

207
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,456
If you really did,
why would you want me?

208
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,459
Because Jang Hui-bin
is interesting.

209
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,586
You're entertaining.

210
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,920
Unbelievable.

211
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,590
Who'd be willing to work
with such a nutcase...

212
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,593
people might wonder.

213
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,386
But I would.

214
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,599
UBCB, use barbarians
to control barbarians.

215
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,477
UNCN, use nutcases
to control nutcases.

216
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,564
You are so unpredictable.

217
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,734
You can predict you'll see me
at Chungdam Heaven today.

218
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,860
Okay, come quick.

219
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,528
I'll be expecting you.

220
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:06,865
Does this mean today
is our first day together?

221
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,744
Please make sure to pay me
for every day I'm there.

222
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,038
I have no intention
of offering you free labor,

223
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,456
not even for a minute.

224
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,042
I'll see you later.

225
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,344
Dad!

226
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,973
Dad!

227
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,610
Wow, I'm pretty
good-looking, yes.

228
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,154
Look at my jawline.

229
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,405
Ouch.

230
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,953
Why should I get dressed up
just for her?

231
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,876
Oh.

232
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,340
Women hate gold necklaces.

233
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,052
There you are.

234
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,221
Ugh.

235
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,682
Women hate tight pants.

236
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,981
How insane.
I make even these look good.

237
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,777
No, I should be humble.

238
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,580
Ugh, there's fur everywhere.

239
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,250
I have a stuffy nose.

240
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,216
This is what I call
a true man's combat uniform.

241
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:53,888
This isn't because I want
to make a good impression.

242
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,728
But what if she falls for me?
That would complicate things.

243
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,861
This would be perfect.

244
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,660
I think she's going to hate it.

245
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,135
Hello, sir.

246
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,472
Wow, I guess you can be polite
and reasonable sometimes.

247
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,515
When I have to make money,
I can be.

248
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,809
You respond well
to financial therapy.

249
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,770
Yes, I like money very much.

250
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,646
My character
is directly proportional

251
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,231
to my monthly salary.

252
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,733
That's not
what I expected from you.

253
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
My experience has taught me
to be afraid of money.

254
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,862
So I'm going to obey
and comply with capitalism.

255
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,864
So, what kind of work
do you need me to do?

256
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,199
A kind smile.

257
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,909
A capitalistic smile.

258
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,577
No, thank you.

259
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,704
If there's anything
you want to say, go ahead.

260
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,705
Don't hold back.

261
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,832
That's what I like about you.

262
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,501
Oh.

263
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,173
Can I really be honest?

264
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,425
Sure, go ahead.

265
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,766
Is that a chastity belt?

266
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,476
Chas...

267
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,562
How can this be a chastity belt?

268
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,397
Well, the design
may be different,

269
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,941
but it serves the same function.

270
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,069
When you have that belt on,
no woman would come near you,

271
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,070
so it is a chastity belt.

272
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,405
Oh, looking good.

273
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,242
"Oh, looking good"?

274
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,706
Why won't this come off?

275
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,166
Ugh, seriously.

276
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,216
Attention.

277
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,719
I was thinking about what I
can do to entertain myself

278
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,763
and recruited a talent.

279
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,766
Clap.

280
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,184
Hello.

281
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,647
She's a new hire.
So what should we do?

282
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,899
We must give
introductions, right?

283
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,252
Let us begin
the introduction game

284
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,962
Am I being pranked?

285
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,422
Skip a beat

286
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,590
This is for real.

287
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,968
You need to introduce yourself
by announcing what you wish for.

288
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,219
Skip two beats

289
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,220
This isn't a kindergarten,

290
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,471
so why would he play
this kind of game with adults?

291
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,723
Oh, just humor him.

292
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,226
Skip three beats,
and one, two, three, four

293
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,686
Eternal youth

294
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,688
Cryptocurrency jackpot

295
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,981
Anti-aging

296
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,649
Younger husband

297
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:52,984
Lease expiration

298
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:54,819
Cinderella

299
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:07,665
This is why what's on your
subconscious mind matters.

300
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,885
Because you always end up

301
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,261
blurting out
your hidden desires

302
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,348
and getting into trouble.

303
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,028
I thought she was interesting,

304
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,697
but she's one of those.

305
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,710
Your predecessor left
after she became a Cinderella,

306
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,338
so how could you say you wish
to become one on your first day?

307
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,007
I was caught off guard,

308
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,468
and I just blurted it out.

309
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,594
Wow,

310
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,888
so it really is your dream.

311
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,556
I don't believe it.

312
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,276
I had no clue.

313
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,029
You sure fooled me.

314
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,781
What do you mean?

315
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,866
I didn't fool you.

316
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,745
You're not desperate for a job.
You're desperate to get married.

317
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,038
Yes.

318
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,209
I applied for a job here
because I want to work hard

319
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,003
and find a good husband.

320
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,714
Don't people generally call
people like you materialistic?

321
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,091
I can't stand people like that.

322
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,134
I hate them.

323
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,553
I'm not materialistic.

324
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,555
I'm just tired of my situation.

325
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,266
Your situation is bad, I guess.

326
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,976
But I'm not a philanthropist.

327
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,354
You have too many problems
for me to work with you.

328
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,148
I told you
I won't offer you free labor,

329
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,525
not even for a minute, didn't I?

330
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,403
We agreed this would be
our first day together.

331
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,362
First day.

332
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,031
Let's do this.

333
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,785
We'll make a wager.

334
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,663
Have fate decide
if you should work here.

335
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,082
Having fun is the most
important thing in my life.

336
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,001
Follow your joy.

337
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
Nice.

338
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,590
Since we're both nutcases,

339
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,217
why not level the playing
field and play as equals?

340
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,427
Sure.

341
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,012
You can choose the game.

342
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,598
Oh, okay.

343
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,059
Follow me.

344
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,074
I smell trouble.

345
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,534
Trouble between
a man and a woman?

346
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,121
That kind of trouble starts

347
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:59,754
when two people's eyes meet,
causing a spark.

348
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,930
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

349
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,560
Who can drink more?

350
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,562
Sure.

351
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,815
But why here of all places?

352
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,942
Because how it tastes
still matters.

353
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,861
Does being at the Han River
make a difference?

354
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,530
Huh? When it's the same
factory-made product?

355
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,824
Everything tastes better
at the Han River.

356
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,158
Ramen tastes better
at the Han River,

357
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,159
and so does
fried chicken and beer.

358
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,328
It's a special benefit of Seoul.

359
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,540
Are you sure
you want to do this?

360
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,500
No making excuses later, okay?

361
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,668
Why?

362
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,253
Getting cold feet?

363
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,381
Do you want to back out again?

364
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,507
Why would I?

365
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,468
Do you know
how healthy my organs are?

366
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:50,221
I've been taking care of them
by always eating organic food.

367
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:55,393
When alcohol enters my body,
they break it down in a flash.

368
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,812
My diet consists mostly
of genetically modified food

369
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,772
with palm oil, high-fructose
corn syrup and gluten,

370
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,858
but maybe that's why my organs

371
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,318
are so strong that alcohol
doesn't affect them.

372
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,239
I see alcohol
as a healthy, God-given gift.

373
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,658
It's great for circulation.

374
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,871
EXCESSIVE DRINKING IS EXTREMELY
HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH

375
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,166
It's that nonsensical
syllogism again.

376
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,377
I won't go easy on you just
because you're a woman.

377
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,420
You're not getting a break.

378
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,423
I won't go easy on you
just because you're a man.

379
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:28,134
You have no idea
what kind of family I am from.

380
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,774
Oh, yes, oh, yes.

381
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,735
-You're off duty until when?
-Just today.

382
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,361
That's great.

383
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,905
Let's have a quick drink, sis.

384
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,782
Okay. We'll just have a sip.

385
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,619
It was really boring
without you at home.

386
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,706
Mom's pregnant, and Jae-rim
can't hold her liquor.

387
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,249
She's just a baby.

388
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,335
A baby? As if.

389
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,128
She's just reckless.

390
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,005
Oh, boy.

391
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,928
Okay, words don't mean a thing.

392
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,763
Let's get started.

393
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:22,688
Huh?

394
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,065
You can't even open it?

395
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,319
It's wet, so it's slippery.

396
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,320
I have a strong grip.

397
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,613
I'm sure you do.

398
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,366
If we arm wrestled,

399
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,702
I could beat a fragile man
like you in one go.

400
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,704
What? Fragile?

401
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,166
Do you want to try it?

402
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,376
Just to see how it goes?

403
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:45,753
Sure.

404
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,381
Fair and square.

405
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,177
Okay, bring it on.

406
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,221
Ready.

407
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,307
-Set.
-Go.

408
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,037
-Man.
-Fair and square.

409
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,082
What should we do?

410
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,544
You are strong,
but I'm stronger.

411
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,134
Huh? Oh, no.

412
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,513
I squeezed your hand too hard,
and your nail got smashed.

413
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,267
You didn't do this.
It's always been like this.

414
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,061
Oh, I was scared.

415
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,859
That must have hurt.

416
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,364
Ouch.

417
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,876
Don't worry about it. Let's just
drink.

418
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,711
I wish you luck.

419
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,088
I know I can beat you at this.

420
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,717
Let's get started
before it goes flat.

421
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,723
Bam.

422
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,479
Hey, hey.

423
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,125
Breaking news.

424
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,835
A human black hole

425
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,922
has appeared
near the Han River.

426
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,715
Please watch out.

427
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,974
WARNING A WILDLIFE-INFESTED AREA

428
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,940
Stop drinking, stop!

429
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:38,759
Finished.

430
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,146
Aw.

431
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,161
You can't be human.

432
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,288
It's called willpower.

433
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,039
What do you want to do now?

434
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,333
One more glass?

435
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:12,835
How can you call this a glass?

436
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,797
I can see you're
determined to win,

437
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,549
so let's just say you won.

438
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,759
You mean that?

439
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,139
You must guarantee
a full-time position.

440
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,348
And you can't fire me on a whim.

441
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,643
Sure. A promise is a promise.

442
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,686
I don't believe this.

443
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,397
Are you drunk?

444
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,733
No, I'm not drunk.

445
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,902
Let me see the contract.

446
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,072
You can't take it back
saying you were drunk.

447
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,407
Oh, boy.

448
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,744
How can this be so easy?

449
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:50,498
As I predicted,
hanging out with you is fun.

450
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,584
Imagine how much more fun
it would be

451
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,628
if we see each other every day.

452
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,756
Fine.

453
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,051
I'm going to make you miserable,
so brace yourself.

454
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,637
Oh, seriously,
getting paid to be picked on?

455
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,639
I love it. Thank you.

456
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:11,602
CONTRACT DATE: NOVEMBER 7TH
2023 / CEO MOON CHA-MIN

457
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,610
How naive of you.

458
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,111
You dream of becoming
a Cinderella?

459
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,781
That was a joke, right?

460
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,699
I wish it was,

461
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,952
but that's my life's goal.

462
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:34,833
If I were you,
I would lie about it.

463
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,878
I know what I want
is archaic and old-fashioned.

464
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,839
But outside marriage,

465
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,425
there's no way I can escape
from my current situation.

466
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,177
Really?

467
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,430
What is it you want to do
after getting married?

468
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:52,101
I will live a happy life
being loved and giving love.

469
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,061
I don't believe
in such abstract things.

470
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,771
It makes you
a good target for scams.

471
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,356
My goodness,

472
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,984
you've never been in love,
have you?

473
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,821
That's too bad.

474
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,951
I believe every living being
deserves to be loved.

475
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,661
A natural right to be loved.

476
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,959
A right to be loved...

477
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,130
But there aren't many people
who enjoy that right.

478
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,007
But I love myself.

479
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,301
I'm self-sufficient.

480
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,262
I don't need to date
or get married.

481
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,723
I'm already rich in love.

482
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,183
Good for you.

483
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,023
But doesn't that make you
feel lonely and bored?

484
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,070
That must be
why I'm doing this with you.

485
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,534
Romantic relationships are
so profound and mysterious

486
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:51,744
that you can never know

487
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,955
what kind of person
you'll fall for.

488
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,583
It feels like god wrote
some invisible code

489
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,209
to determine compatibility.

490
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,003
Come here.

491
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,588
Just for a second.

492
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,342
Beep. Oh, we're compatible.

493
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:09,261
Beep, beep!
We're not compatible.

494
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,601
Anyway, what's taking
the boss so long?

495
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,358
I will start tomorrow, then.

496
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:26,278
Hey, your boss
is still drinking.

497
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,914
Talking here is pretty good.

498
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,001
The Han River is really nice.

499
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,713
I need to use the restroom,

500
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,467
but my jerk boss
doesn't want to leave.

501
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,097
Let me have a sip.

502
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,481
We're out of beer.

503
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,108
Shall we go?

504
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,859
Oh, seriously.

505
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,536
I'm in trouble.

506
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,622
What's wrong?

507
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,041
You said we should go,
but you're not moving.

508
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,587
-Restroom.
-Huh?

509
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,423
Restroom.

510
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,385
I need to use the restroom.

511
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,720
But you're supposed
to be an adult.

512
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,433
I guess we did drink a lot.

513
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,268
Is there a restroom nearby?

514
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,519
No.

515
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,938
It's really far away.

516
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:48,235
ROUTE 1 - ROUTE 2

517
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,737
IT IS TOTALLY FAR AWAY

518
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,240
IT IS TOTALLY, TOTALLY FAR AWAY

519
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,492
Why didn't you plan better, huh?

520
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,452
Instead of focusing
only on the input,

521
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,411
you should've thought
about the output

522
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,370
and chosen a place
with a restroom.

523
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,664
Why did you have
to talk so much?

524
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:01,832
You talked a lot, too.

525
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,667
Oh, no...

526
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,128
What do I do?
I really have to go.

527
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,588
What do I do?

528
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,339
Oh, seriously.

529
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,176
Ugh...

530
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,013
What was that?

531
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,724
Are you crying?

532
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,436
Did you wet your pants?

533
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,607
I'm trying to shed some tears.

534
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,442
Tears are liquid, too.

535
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,152
I can't believe you.

536
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:31,862
Ugh...

537
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,490
Would you like me
to keep watching?

538
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,699
Do you want to go
into those bushes?

539
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,867
No.

540
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,369
I'm a civilized person.

541
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,288
Heaven is watching,

542
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,831
so I'd rather jump
into the river.

543
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,008
Would you like
to cover yourself?

544
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,927
Would you like to borrow this?

545
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,846
Just leave, please.

546
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,892
If I have to go,
I will take care of it,

547
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,227
so please leave.

548
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,854
How could I just leave when
there's a civilian in trouble?

549
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,733
Unless you can pee in my place,
I don't want you to be here,

550
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,568
so please just go.

551
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:49,022
Well, then, clean that up
before you leave.

552
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,319
The sky is clear,
and so is my mind.

553
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,613
If only it was raining,

554
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,950
and if only I was
completely drunk...

555
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,378
Try your best to hold it.

556
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,756
I will try my best, too.

557
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,693
Am I being saved?

558
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,038
Don't relax, okay?

559
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,206
If you pee on me, I'll kill you.

560
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,834
Sweetheart, run faster.

561
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:51,960
You're delirious.

562
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,046
Pull yourself together!

563
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,465
Where is it, darn it?

564
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:01,845
The arrogant Prince Cha-min
has turned into a loyal

565
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,681
and strong servant for now.

566
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,475
How nice.

567
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,894
Sphincters, try to hold on
a little longer!

568
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,814
TOILET

569
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:24,785
The last part is up to you.

570
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:28,372
Thank you. I will not give up.

571
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:43,053
TOILET

572
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,721
Why is he still here?

573
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,309
How am I supposed
to face him again?

574
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:01,965
It was rather nice,

575
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,971
if it weren't for the situation,

576
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,932
and if it weren't for me.

577
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,684
Just for him.

578
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,566
Maybe he's a good guy.

579
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:24,863
Oh, boy.

580
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,036
Hey, whoa.

581
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,706
What's going on?
Why are you walking like that?

582
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,709
This is me being embarrassed.

583
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,795
I don't know what to do

584
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,631
now that I've shown
such an embarrassing side of me

585
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,800
to my future boss.

586
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,928
Right.

587
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,514
I don't know
who actually won the game.

588
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,391
That'd be me because I'll be
the one making money.

589
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,193
Honey.

590
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,034
Dan-ah.

591
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,836
You weren't at Chungdam Heaven,

592
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,547
and you wouldn't answer
your phone.

593
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,175
I had to use the couple app
to locate my fiancé.

594
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,972
Fiancé?

595
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,437
"Honey"?

596
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,859
He told me he didn't need
to date or be in love,

597
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,485
but he's engaged?

598
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:50,282
What the heck?
Why would he lie to me?

599
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,909
Is he a bad guy?

600
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,624
When you finally find a job
after a long, hard search,

601
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,836
you will find a weird,
difficult boss.

602
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,923
Rooting for all job seekers
and holders,

603
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,135
until next time!
