00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,221
DREAMING
OF FREAKING FAIRYTALE

2
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,265
EPISODIO 5

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,851
A kiss, a symbol
of happy endings.

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,316
Why does it only take
a single kiss

5
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,318
to wrap everything up
in fairy tales?

6
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,075
When things aren't that simple
in real life?

7
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:39,874
Kissing is just the beginning.

8
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,044
EFECTOS DE MARIPOSA
ROMÁNTICOS

9
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,964
Look what you did!

10
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,137
How could you do this to me?

11
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,363
Have her clean this up
and let it go.

12
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:12,990
It looked like a mistake.

13
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,117
Her life is miserable
because she makes mistakes

14
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,410
like this.

15
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,113
How can you make
a mistake like this?

16
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,829
When mistakes like this pile up,
they lead to trouble.

17
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,709
I love...

18
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,297
mint chocolate.

19
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,789
Why did you just sit there?

20
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,666
You should've acted
like you do with me.

21
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,171
Well, a part of it was my fault,

22
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,089
and I'm an employee here.

23
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,633
Exactly.

24
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,928
Only I can be hard
on my employees, not outsiders.

25
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,142
By the way, is your cheek okay?

26
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,810
Oh...

27
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,731
My impacted wisdom tooth
right here...

28
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,024
I think it flew out.

29
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,695
Her swing didn't seem
that strong.

30
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,280
She's no Shohei Otani.

31
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,032
Then why did you ask?

32
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,533
Because I felt bad.

33
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,246
Uh...

34
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,582
you should go to your fiancée.

35
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,334
She looked really mad.

36
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,919
She has anger management issues.

37
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,588
Nobody can predict
when she'll lash out.

38
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,590
She's like a rage booby trap.

39
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,428
Well, maybe she didn't like
my outfit.

40
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,186
She probably left

41
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,604
because she felt embarrassed
after slapping me.

42
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,689
I know.

43
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,358
She felt embarrassed,

44
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,070
so you should find out why
and check if she's okay now.

45
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,656
She's your fiancée, after all.

46
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,202
You should go. I really am fine.

47
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,135
She is my fiancée,

48
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,680
but we're not in love
with each other.

49
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,936
I'm not responsible
for her emotions.

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,735
It's like a business deal.

51
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:19,987
You know
that I don't really care

52
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:20,946
about my company.

53
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:25,951
I...

54
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,085
Only care about whether or not
you're okay.

55
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,091
So wash that stain away
and come out.

56
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,386
Oh...

57
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,556
That outfit looks great on you.

58
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,865
Why is he treating me this way?

59
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,293
I need to talk to you.

60
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,215
Why did you do that?

61
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,050
I couldn't stand
watching you care

62
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,093
about someone else.

63
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,886
Then stop coming here

64
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:27,763
because I plan
to continue caring

65
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:28,722
about that woman.

66
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,349
Do you want me to slap you
on your right cheek, too?

67
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,683
You said we should help her
become a Cinderella

68
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:32,643
and have her leave.

69
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,021
I'm gonna be
her stupid fairy godmother.

70
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,358
Crazy bastard.

71
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,486
Why would you do that?

72
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,241
A crazy bastard needs no reason.

73
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,034
He does it because he's crazy.

74
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,953
Is that so?

75
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,498
I get crazy very often,
too, so that's great.

76
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,874
By the way,

77
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,418
why do you keep overreacting
to what I do?

78
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,170
It makes me uncomfortable.

79
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,756
Then you...

80
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,051
better not try
to look for reasons

81
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,344
in a crazy bitch like me.

82
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,221
Dan-ah,

83
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,015
you're not a Chihuahua, are you?

84
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,852
You can't bite and attack
everyone who annoys you.

85
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,033
Wow.

86
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,871
I wonder if I can take her
to see Mr. Kang Hyung-wook.

87
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,551
Lucky you.

88
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,055
You can run your business
any way you want.

89
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,350
I've never seen
an upper class social club

90
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,227
where protecting
their employees' morale

91
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,979
comes first.

92
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,773
It's only natural
to protect my people.

93
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,319
Is there any other reason?

94
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,737
Should there be?

95
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,948
Men like us

96
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,618
shouldn't get involved
with women like her.

97
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,871
Because instead of it being
a relationship,

98
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,748
it becomes a struggle

99
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,625
that goes against
the social order.

100
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,878
Why do you think
that would be difficult for me?

101
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,923
You look like a delicate flower
in a greenhouse.

102
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,217
Do I?

103
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,552
Thank you.

104
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,846
You're saying
I have delicate features.

105
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,848
Do you think I'm joking?

106
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,601
Someone told me

107
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,103
that being too serious
is a problem.

108
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,272
Do you have feelings for her?

109
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,984
Before that,

110
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,280
why are you doing this,
Mr. Baek Do-hong?

111
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,452
You don't...

112
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,084
have feelings for me, do you?

113
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,763
Don't think about me, okay?

114
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,893
You and I are very different.

115
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,826
You're embarrassed about me,
aren't you?

116
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,494
That's not what I'm saying!

117
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,954
Yes, it is!

118
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,331
I said you shouldn't waste
your time on a nobody like him.

119
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,837
Hey, Min-ji.

120
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,674
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Seong-jae.

121
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,603
I won't lose again.

122
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,113
I was in shock earlier.

123
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,907
I am sorry
for ruining your night.

124
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,118
I will pay you for your outfit.

125
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,329
That's okay.
Why would you apologize?

126
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,915
It happened
because I pushed you.

127
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:30,213
Saying you're sorry
when it wasn't your fault

128
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,382
is what poor people do.

129
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,926
As if being born poor
is a crime,

130
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,803
they apologize out of habit.

131
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,348
Powerful people don't do that.

132
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,307
Look at me.

133
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,059
I'm standing tall,
even after doing something mean.

134
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,982
Apologizing won't change
my self-worth,

135
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,901
so it's okay.

136
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:52,736
True.

137
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,531
Your self-worth
will remain subpar always.

138
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,950
No matter what you do,
it won't change much.

139
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,954
So don't get any ideas
about Baek Do-hong.

140
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,623
I'll tear you apart.

141
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:08,919
Director Baek.

142
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,487
I guess I'm the kind of person
who can't meet anyone successful

143
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,532
or change my life
for the better.

144
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,327
Is this all I'm getting?

145
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,330
A subpar life

146
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,874
where I get looked down on?

147
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,466
What's wrong?

148
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,009
Did something happen?

149
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,596
I can't explode,

150
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,723
so I'm holding it in.

151
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,143
Holding it in
comes with the job.

152
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,769
Compensation for being
humiliated is included

153
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:08,728
in my pay, isn't it?

154
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,480
I never paid you such money.

155
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:11,857
Don't hold it in.

156
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,609
You're an important person, too.

157
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,570
It's okay.

158
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,196
Who was it? Come.

159
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,079
This place,

160
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,002
this world is so unfair.

161
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,883
Since I was born anyway,

162
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,845
I wanted to live a decent life
like other people do.

163
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,097
I wanted to escape
from my miserable life

164
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,557
where everyone is welcome

165
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,476
to step all over me,

166
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,896
so I tried to overstep
and reach for the stars,

167
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,651
but the world keeps telling me
to stay where I am.

168
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,446
Men like us

169
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,406
shouldn't get involved
with women like her.

170
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,658
Because instead of it being
a relationship,

171
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,410
it becomes a struggle

172
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,329
that goes against
the social order.

173
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,041
I thought things
would be different

174
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,709
if I got a job here
at Chungdam Heaven,

175
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,755
but it's the same.

176
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,176
I will change it for you.

177
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
If you want me to,
close your eyes.

178
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,317
Your self-worth
will remain subpar always.

179
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,903
No matter what you do,
it won't change much.

180
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,325
Do something, anything.

181
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,461
What in the world
could kissing change?

182
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,260
You're the one who changed.

183
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,514
You hated my dream.

184
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,143
So why are you helping me?

185
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,522
Because I don't hate you.

186
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,444
Make your dream come true
and be loved,

187
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,404
but from someone else.

188
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,409
You told me that everyone has
the right to be loved.

189
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,704
I will help you find love

190
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,917
so you won't be heartbroken
anymore.

191
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,716
Oh, so you're saying

192
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,344
you felt really sorry for me?

193
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,595
You told me
to do something, anything.

194
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,222
I didn't mean you could kiss me.

195
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,225
You didn't know
I was gonna do that?

196
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,394
I thought you would fake it.

197
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,522
How could you do it for real,
as if we're involved?

198
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,440
You did it for real,
and I only responded.

199
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,527
You were so very eager.

200
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,904
Don't be ridiculous. I wasn't.

201
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,781
That's uncalled for.

202
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,616
It's not like
I can turn back time.

203
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,788
Shall we try?

204
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,044
Stop fooling around.

205
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,839
How am I gonna face
the members now?

206
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,259
Earlier I had
a brief mental breakdown,

207
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,719
so I wasn't myself.

208
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,637
I was perfectly fine
in both mind and body.

209
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,264
It was all intentional

210
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,141
so you would become
this amazing woman

211
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,934
who captured the heart
of the aloof CEO.

212
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,770
Don't you think other men
would feel attracted to you?

213
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,272
Oh, is that right?

214
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,733
I am ever so grateful.

215
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,359
Nope.

216
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,403
Isn't it more like ecstatic?

217
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,449
I am way too ecstatic.

218
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,494
Seriously.

219
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,289
Where are you going?
I'll drop you off.

220
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,666
Forget it. I can manage.

221
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,461
You have the company
credit card, don't you?

222
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,795
Take a deluxe taxi.

223
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,089
I'll take
the most expensive one!

224
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,302
DELUXE

225
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,808
Pull yourself together.

226
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,477
Don't be so happy.

227
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,649
I feel like my lips
have a heart.

228
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,359
Are you all right, Miss?

229
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,572
Yes, I'm fine.

230
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,995
Huh? Huh? Oh?

231
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,458
Did you ever... drive a van?

232
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,794
I've only ever driven
a deluxe taxi.

233
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,923
Could I ask you something?

234
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,509
What do you think about a man

235
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,469
who kisses a woman
he's not interested in?

236
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,055
Should I kill him?

237
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,724
A jerk who's a constant flirt

238
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,895
should get run over
by a sturdy taxi like this one.

239
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,147
No, he's not that bad.

240
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,026
But the kiss was nice.

241
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,611
I bet he is handsome

242
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,238
like me.

243
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,715
I am a man
of extraordinary patience

244
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,134
who regards women
as nothing but rocks.

245
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,889
Do something, anything.

246
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,944
Man, seriously.

247
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,613
Get out of my body,
lustful thoughts!

248
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,741
GOD'S GREAT LOVE

249
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,210
May your confused

250
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,964
And chaotic heart

251
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,386
Be filled

252
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:43,349
With God's great love

253
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,101
Amen.

254
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:46,853
Hallelujah.

255
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,945
He's filled
with a different love.

256
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,579
Will I be able

257
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,708
to let you be with another man?

258
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,849
You need to get out.

259
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,059
Why are you sitting
in that seat?

260
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,687
Did you call
for a substitute driver?

261
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,655
Looks yummy, no?

262
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,031
If you enjoy it,
it's 0 calories.

263
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,079
Dan-ah, you're home.

264
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,999
We're having a midnight snack.

265
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,084
You want some?

266
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,502
You eat it all.

267
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,382
How can you eat that right now?

268
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,010
That doesn't mean
to stop eating!

269
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,137
Seriously.

270
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,479
I am in so much pain right now,

271
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,315
but you're eating sweet
and sour pork?

272
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,238
We're cleaning up, look.

273
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,739
We're finished,
so this is trash.

274
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,116
That's right.

275
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:24,158
Wait...

276
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,619
Oh, boy.

277
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,038
I didn't even get a bite.

278
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,207
It's okay.

279
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,002
When we were out in the field,

280
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,295
we used to get dispatched

281
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,214
whenever we ordered
Chinese food.

282
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,883
You're making it sound
like we did honest work,

283
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,218
when all we did
was beat people up.

284
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,095
But!

285
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,848
Now we're being beaten up
by Dan-ah.

286
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,932
What's up with that?

287
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,059
We did kinda get soft.

288
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,894
Anyway,

289
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,272
I think we need to find out
what happened to her

290
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,024
and take care of it.

291
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,442
Yes, sir.

292
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,569
Oh, what a waste.

293
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,237
Whoa, man,
the sweet and sour pork

294
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,238
is buried underneath, moron.

295
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,489
It looks like dog food.

296
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,242
Let's not waste this.

297
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,618
Hasn't anyone told you
that you look

298
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,786
like Cho Jung-seok?

299
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,372
Mom, I like Cho Jung-seok.

300
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,331
-So do I.
-Me too.

301
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm home.

302
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,334
Jae-rim, you're home.

303
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,129
Jae-rim, he's Su-jin's coworker
at the hospital,

304
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:22,050
and he has a crush on her.

305
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,555
Hello, my name is Koo Nam-hoon.

306
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,016
Please call me Dr. Koo.

307
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,811
Okay... hello.

308
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,857
Look at these.

309
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,861
I wasn't going to accept
any presents,

310
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,614
but these are so thoughtful.

311
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,784
I'm only accepting them
because you like them, Mom.

312
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,452
Wow, I can tell you two have

313
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,120
a great mother-daughter
relationship.

314
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,830
And I think that's possible

315
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,373
because you are such
a wonderful mother.

316
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,794
Use this body oil
to massage your body every day

317
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,545
to help ease
the poor circulation brought on

318
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,047
by your pregnancy.

319
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,802
A massage is most effective
when someone else

320
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,803
gives it to you.

321
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,812
I will massage you from now on.

322
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,106
Why should you?

323
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,193
A person with good grip strength
should give massages.

324
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,444
I'll do it for you, Mom.

325
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,530
Why don't you use that strength
to work at a slaughterhouse?

326
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,117
I'd prefer to slaughter you
with them first.

327
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,701
-Whatever.
-Jae-rim,

328
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,036
would you like a midnight snack?

329
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,871
Dr. Koo brought some beef.

330
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:37,708
He said a pregnant woman needs
quality protein and iron.

331
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,504
But it wasn't domestic beef,

332
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,923
so there's some left.

333
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,344
Here.

334
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,943
One more round.

335
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,237
Hey, hey,

336
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,364
pushing your body to the limit
just because you're stressed out

337
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,907
can only make things worse.

338
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,576
You think exercising
is good for you, right?

339
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,246
But our cartilage, our knees,
there's no refilling them.

340
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,582
What's going on?

341
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,083
Tell me.

342
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,254
-Why you little...
-Ouch. Ouch!

343
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,673
I won't let go
until you tell me.

344
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,387
I have feelings for someone.

345
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,346
Yes?

346
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,723
But I'm not gonna fall for her.

347
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,517
-Ouch.
-Why not?

348
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,353
Is she married?

349
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,438
No.

350
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,982
Her dream is to become
a Cinderella

351
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,150
and have a better life.

352
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,985
That's not good.

353
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,196
My mom was like that.

354
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,492
She is so much like my mom.

355
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,875
My mom ended up
getting a divorce and went away

356
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,419
with a fortune,
and I can understand that, okay?

357
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,129
It's okay to move on
to look for money and love

358
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,548
and have a better life, but...

359
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,761
my dad had
a really difficult time.

360
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:15,806
I...

361
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,686
don't want to live like my dad.

362
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,982
But you take after your father.

363
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,442
No.

364
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,946
I'm gonna personally help her
find the man of her dreams.

365
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,490
Is that a new kind of fetish?

366
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,243
It's better to let her go
and miss her

367
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,162
than to be dumped
and resent her.

368
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,084
I call that a win-win situation.

369
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,171
One more round.

370
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,965
Oh, boy.

371
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:01,644
He should let
his heart guide him

372
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,521
instead of wasting his energy
like this.

373
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:04,730
That energy!

374
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,818
Use that
to fall in love instead.

375
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:42,768
What is it?

376
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,855
When you see someone,
shouldn't you say hello?

377
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,066
Are you still angry at me?

378
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,027
No.

379
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,322
I'm not angry. I'm just...

380
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,200
a little embarrassed.

381
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,747
Are you okay?

382
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,541
Huh? Well...

383
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,502
as you know, I'm always relaxed.

384
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,504
I don't dwell on stuff
like that.

385
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,885
Don't worry too much
about it and take it easy,

386
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,636
as you normally do.

387
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,222
Oh, I see.

388
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,974
I'm not worried about it either.

389
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,143
My life is so hectic
that I don't have the energy

390
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:25,728
to focus on stuff like that.

391
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm just gonna pretend
that I ate a big spoon worm.

392
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,362
Spoon... spoon worm?

393
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,908
It wasn't really like...
a spoon worm, was it?

394
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,118
Why? Spoon worms
from Jeju Island are meaty

395
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,703
and delicious. I love them.

396
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,788
Really?

397
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,248
So, I...

398
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,334
was that rare spoon worm
for you?

399
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,003
Um... no.

400
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,548
There was no nutritional value
in it.

401
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,055
Nutritional...

402
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,817
SPOON WORM

403
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,198
I can't believe my first kiss
was compared to a spoon worm.

404
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,418
We just got this.

405
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:31,752
It's perfect for a groom
with a figure

406
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,045
as beautiful as his.

407
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:36,382
How do I look?

408
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,092
Cha-min,

409
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,682
we only had one kiss,
so don't get clingy.

410
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,731
Your kiss sucked.

411
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,036
Mr. Groom, Mr. Groom?

412
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,872
Would you like to go
with this tuxedo?

413
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,081
No, thank you!

414
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,168
You need to alter this!
It's giving me a wedgie!

415
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,643
He didn't seem like he cared.

416
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,230
I was the only one
who couldn't even sleep.

417
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:40,905
Well...

418
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,324
last night...

419
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,910
the party had a closing event

420
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,578
that none of the employees
knew about.

421
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:49,747
Oh,

422
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,668
I didn't know about it either,
being an employee myself.

423
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:55,711
Oh...

424
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,131
Did anything else
happen afterwards?

425
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,009
No, nothing happened.

426
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,762
Huh? How weird.

427
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,431
Were tongues involved?

428
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,227
Well...

429
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,772
My mind went blank
at that moment, so I'm not sure.

430
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,358
You felt swept away.

431
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,652
There are rumors
about your secret romance.

432
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,736
Are they true?

433
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:21,737
No, they're not.

434
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,531
What about last night's
incident?

435
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,616
Ms. Shin Jae-rim's goal
is becoming a Cinderella,

436
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,618
but she wasn't getting anywhere,
so I tried to help her.

437
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,119
But you're not that kind of man.

438
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,038
Don't you think
you went too far?

439
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,623
I didn't think so at the time.

440
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,124
I am truly sorry.

441
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,752
Are you... obsessed
with appearing cool?

442
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,129
I never thought
I was obsessed about it.

443
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,215
However, I had had a few drinks.

444
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,009
That is not an extenuating
circumstance.

445
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,720
In vino veritas, perhaps?

446
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,430
I wasn't that drunk.

447
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:49,890
Oh, something's off!

448
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,308
Are you having
a mental breakdown?

449
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,270
I will get tested for it.

450
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,607
-It's true.
-One hundred percent.

451
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,150
How long has our 8th generation
conglomerate family member

452
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,821
Prince Cha-min
been this pitiful?

453
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,197
Stop filming me.

454
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,288
You don't understand women
at all.

455
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,544
What should I do?

456
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,838
If you want to capture
a woman's heart...

457
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,216
You need spicy rice cakes.

458
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,384
Spice rice cakes?

459
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,139
These days, even fancy places
offer spicy rice cakes.

460
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,766
Chungdam Heaven should have
spicy rice cakes

461
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,143
on the menu, too.

462
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:35,811
Try it.

463
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,062
Okay.

464
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:46,864
Wow, I know I made this,
but it's really good.

465
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,616
Just like kisses,

466
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,702
isn't this a dish
that has no nutritional value?

467
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,496
What?

468
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:58,167
Kisses and spicy rice cakes
are food for the soul.

469
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,169
When you eat it,
your soul feels full.

470
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,671
That can't be true.

471
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,975
It's too spicy.

472
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:20,898
Jae-rim,

473
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,941
hello.

474
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,783
Uh... hello.

475
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,785
Would you like me
to introduce you

476
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,244
to the members over there?

477
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,830
Or I can give you a cup of tea.

478
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,918
I'm here to talk to you today.

479
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,628
Ouch.

480
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,712
Are you all right?

481
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,881
I only spilled a little bit.
I'm fine.

482
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,716
Let me have some ice water.

483
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,468
Sure.

484
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,595
It's a little hot
in here, right?

485
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,401
I'm fine.

486
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,027
It's turning red.

487
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,406
You need to ice it right away.

488
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,034
By the way...

489
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,787
what's going on between you
and Mr. Moon Cha-min?

490
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,378
He's my boss,
and I'm his employee.

491
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:28,048
What about last night?

492
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,050
What was that?

493
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,261
Was that harassment?

494
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,680
He was drunk.

495
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:40,269
When he gets drunk,
he becomes indecent.

496
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,353
Indecent?

497
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,354
Yes.

498
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,314
I heard...

499
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,653
when he gets drunk,
he goes around Chungdam-dong

500
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,030
and finds utility poles
and kisses them.

501
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,241
He's a total nuisance.

502
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,503
You're dry, aren't you?

503
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,297
Didn't you put on any lip balm?

504
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,758
How cute.

505
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,218
You're wearing a hairband.

506
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,013
UTILITY POLE COLLECTOR

507
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,139
Wow.

508
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,477
Did you come to ask me that?

509
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,438
No. I have other questions.

510
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,315
About what?

511
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,525
About you.

512
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:33,697
I want to get to know you.

513
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,576
So next time, instead of here,

514
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,328
how about coming to my office?

515
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,125
Why would I go to your office?

516
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,294
There's something
I want to show you there.

517
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,683
This is my invitation.

518
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:03,435
Wear it when you come.

519
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,677
Last night you broke the order
I told you about.

520
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,929
Why should I help maintain
your order?

521
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:40,806
Right.

522
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,394
So I'm gonna have fun, too,
crossing the line and all.

523
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,020
Oh...

524
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,605
how fun.

525
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,776
Was it fun
to kiss Ms. Shin Jae-rim?

526
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,445
Oh, don't pry, okay?

527
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:56,947
You'll get hurt.

528
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:57,948
You too.

529
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,204
Don't ever do anything
like that again.

530
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,418
Who are you to say that to me?

531
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:12,754
Wait and see

532
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,841
who I will turn out to be.

533
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,056
I'm not sure what I will see,

534
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,641
but so far...

535
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,478
I am very happy
with what I'm seeing.

536
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,317
You fell hook,
line and sinker for it.

537
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,902
This is all part
of my grand plan.

538
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,987
But how could you fall
for my trap so easily?

539
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,280
You think the woman I kissed
is special?

540
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,448
Of course you do.

541
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,325
Everything is going
as I planned.

542
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:42,910
Baek Do-hong, you're an idiot.

543
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,329
To be honest,

544
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,289
I can't tell which one
is the idiot.

545
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:12,481
Why is Baek Do-hong interested
in me all of a sudden?

546
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,026
Is my wish still valid?

547
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,362
Or...

548
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,949
was it... the kiss?

549
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:32,751
Jae-rim!

550
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,712
What are you thinking about
so seriously?

551
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,714
No, I'm not thinking
about anything.

552
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,842
Jae-rim, what are you
gonna do now?

553
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:41,843
What do you mean?

554
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,847
I think Mr. Moon has
a crush on you.

555
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,351
It's all part of his plan
to get me out of here.

556
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,645
He's uncomfortable about
kicking me out,

557
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,854
so he's trying to find
a better way.

558
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,189
I don't think so.

559
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,566
He gets way too sensitive
and unpredictable

560
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,734
when you're involved.

561
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,695
I mean, he never used to be
like that.

562
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,279
He was always a total nutcase.

563
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,991
So you're saying
he was like a sweet bully

564
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,867
or an innocent pervert,

565
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,745
like a unicorn, so to speak.

566
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,331
Should we go and summon
that unicorn one more time?

567
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,501
Let's test him!

568
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:20,048
Have a snack, sir.

569
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,677
What's with that hairpin?

570
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,054
Did you bring it when you
defected to South Korea?

571
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,305
Oh,

572
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,766
Mr. Baek Do-hong gave it to me.

573
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,518
No wonder.

574
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,980
So, what did you talk about
with Baek-Dumb?

575
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,314
Baek-Dumb?

576
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,109
Baek... What?

577
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,402
Say Baek Do-hong really fast.

578
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,445
Baek Do-hong, Baek Do-hong,
Baek-Dumb,

579
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,030
Baek-Dumb, Baek-Dumb,
Baek-Dumb,

580
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,449
Dumb, Dumb, Baek-Dumb. See?

581
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,908
Oh, boy.

582
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,326
Baek Do-hong.

583
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,413
Baek Do-hong, Baek Do-hong,
Baek-Dumb, Baek-Dumb...

584
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,543
Don't make fun of his cute name.

585
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,587
You're so mean.

586
00:38:59,004 --> 00:38:59,921
Fine.

587
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,341
What did Mr. Baek Do-hong
with a cute name say to you?

588
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,552
You want to hear it?

589
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,724
Yes.

590
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,480
It looks like
your impulsive action worked.

591
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:21,485
He... invited me to his office.

592
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,279
H-His office? Why his office?

593
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,989
What is he gonna do there
with you?

594
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,201
Well... I wouldn't know.

595
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:30,243
Hmm...

596
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,496
You're... gonna act all naive

597
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:33,914
and innocent and go there,
aren't you?

598
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:34,873
I have to.

599
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,627
I'm gonna pretend
I am clueless and go there.

600
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,468
Isn't that what you wanted me
to do?

601
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,726
Everything happened
because the kiss you gave me

602
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,977
did its job.

603
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:58,814
But...

604
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,024
I think there's a side effect.

605
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,484
What side effect?

606
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,694
Take responsibility.

607
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,364
Responsibility for what?

608
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,537
Let us...

609
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,708
have one more kiss.

610
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,671
Before I go to his office,

611
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,549
I want to figure out something.

612
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,300
Why?

613
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:28,927
What is it?

614
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,179
Why, why a kiss?

615
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,349
Because it felt so weird.

616
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,354
It felt so weird

617
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,315
that I want to feel it again.

618
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,280
Then I think I'll figure it out.

619
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,409
Are you serious?

620
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:53,869
Of course.

621
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,997
It's just the two of us,

622
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,376
so let's do it right.

623
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,297
Are you sure
you won't regret it?

624
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,423
Yes.

625
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,554
If you want to, close your eyes.
