DREAMING OF FREAKING FAIRY TALE

2
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,142
Why a Cinderella story
in the 21st century,

3
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,811
the metaverse era, you ask?

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,939
-That is because...
-Giddy-up!

5
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,316
...there is a pitiful woman

6
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:28,654
who seems to be destined
to become a Cinderella.

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:29,947
Yay!

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,950
But there's something special
about this girl.

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,494
But before I show you
what that is...

10
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,582
This drama
isn't for sweet little kids.

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,918
Adults who want to reach
for the stars, gather around.

HANYANG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

13
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:48,424
Shall we begin
a brand new Cinderella story?

14
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,513
Excuse me.

15
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,736
Dad.

16
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,655
If you leave like this,
I'll kill you!

17
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,824
Don't worry.

18
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,829
l won't leave like this.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,373
Good. Don't.

20
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,709
If you do, it would be
totally unconscionable.

21
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,152
Dad.

22
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,532
Dad?

23
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,576
Dad.

24
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,705
Dad!

25
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,545
With her dad gone,

26
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,964
she is left with her stepmom
and stepsisters.

27
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,179
Honey.

28
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:21,433
Is this the beginning
of her life as a Cinderella?

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,979
How many tears will she shed?

30
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,774
Don't cry, Shin Jae-rim.

31
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,193
Living is harder than dying.

32
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,820
If you cry now,
there'll be no hope.

33
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,159
Her dad watching in heaven
is so heartbroken...

34
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,789
that he rose.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,001
Rise!

36
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,379
Rise.

37
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,965
Rise!

38
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,427
Rise!

39
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:59,263
TWENTY YEARS AGO

40
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,604
Rise.

41
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,732
Ik, rise.

42
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:26,248
MANLIEST MAN

43
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,311
With her dad, Cinderella moved
into her stepmom's apartment.

44
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,646
Oh, how adorable.

45
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,399
Welcome, Jae-rim.

46
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,234
A rib!

47
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,987
Oh, yum.

48
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,365
Intimidated by everyone else,

49
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,866
she never enjoyed
a decent meal.

50
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,119
-Try it.
-Oh, it's so delicious.

51
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,578
-Here's some "japchae."
-Thanks.

52
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:52,918
With her dad gone, imagine how
much worse it will be for her.

53
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,718
Mom, you need to eat.

54
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,804
You haven't eaten in days.

55
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,850
She can eat with no trouble,
so why can't you?

56
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,228
Why should I eat?

57
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,274
I wanted to look beautiful
for him in his last hours

58
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,403
and got Botox and everything,

59
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,071
but he passed away
that very day...

60
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,367
What am I going to do now?

61
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,952
Eating will give you
the strength to go on, okay?

62
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,995
Eat.

63
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,621
Mom, have some salted fish.

64
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,706
Here.

65
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,876
What was that?

66
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,544
Are you sick?

67
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:39,089
Would you like to get
a medical check-up?

68
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,759
That's not what I need.

69
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,219
It's just that I can't live
without him.

70
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,847
How am I supposed
to fill the emptiness

71
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,931
now that he's gone?

72
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:51,602
My stepmom loved my dad
with all her heart.

73
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,271
But since I was like a package
deal to her, so to speak,

74
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:55,606
I'll have to pull
myself together

75
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,691
and move out
as quickly as possible.

76
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:18,295
I left something...

77
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,131
for you...

78
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,804
in the second drawer.

don't take the long way

Take the shortcut.

Get a job here

In the heart of Cheongdam-dong

96
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,881
lives Prince Cha-min,
who has a mind

97
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,010
that is as white
and pure as snow.

98
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,446
Sir, Chungdam Heaven's net
profit for this month

99
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,947
is a whopping 200 percent!

100
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,282
Oh, really?

101
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,284
Negative 200 percent.

102
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,787
At this rate, you might have
to close down the business.

103
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,206
Great.

104
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,415
It's going according to plan.

105
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,499
How do you mean?

106
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,001
What does it mean to be
a conglomerate family?

107
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,419
It means having
money to burn, right?

108
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,754
But if a conglomerate
family dwells on money

109
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,880
and suffers because of it,

110
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,923
are they truly be
a conglomerate family?

111
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,341
No, they are
the slaves to money.

112
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,425
Oh, right.

113
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,551
You're not a member

114
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,386
of a 3rd generation conglomerate
family but a carefree member

115
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,429
of an 8th generation
conglomerate family, right?

116
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,847
Of course.

117
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,766
Since I was lucky enough
to be born into such a family,

118
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,892
I should make the most of it.

119
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,561
So instead of dwell on money,

120
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,939
I'm going to do
what my soul tells me to do.

121
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,690
You should do what
your employees tell you to do.

122
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,694
The rich are dying to join,
so why won't you accept them?

123
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,488
This is a business, too,
isn't it?

124
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,697
Sh, sh.

125
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,742
My soul is talking to me.

126
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,744
Right?
You think so, too, don't you?

127
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,621
He says not to accept
just anyone.

128
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,831
This is a dangerous world
with all kinds of weirdos.

129
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:00,958
We have to be careful.

130
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,252
Still, we should try
to make money.

131
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,129
As for my employees' salaries,

132
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:09,299
since the business
isn't doing well...

133
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,634
A 10 percent increase!

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,761
You mean that?

135
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:13,971
Work should be enjoyable.

136
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,307
There's only one thing you
must remember in life.

137
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,559
Follow your joy.

138
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,230
Ah.

139
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,439
Ah.

140
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,037
Ugh, that's what he left you?

141
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,039
Tsk, you can never get a break,
can you?

142
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,375
Drink up. It's on me.

143
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,177
After reading his letter,

144
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,306
I felt like a fool
for feeling sad.

145
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,516
I mean, my dad
didn't do much for me,

146
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,810
but I would've been
okay with something

147
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,854
as small as "I'm sorry"
or "I love you."

148
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,022
So why did he have to tell me

149
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,316
that I could never be successful
on my own before he died?

150
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,067
I can't even call him my dad.

151
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,486
He was more like armpit hair.
He had no use.

152
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,531
Didn't you hear
that a Chungdam Heaven employee

153
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,701
is marrying into
a conglomerate family?

154
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,912
Stuff like that still happens,
I guess.

155
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,414
But I wouldn't count
on that happening to me.

156
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,999
No member of a conglomerate
family would be crazy enough.

157
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,167
Who knows?

158
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,879
Right, who knows.

159
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,007
I didn't know
my insufferable dad

160
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,593
would pass away like that.

161
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,849
I won't need to take care
of him when he's old!

162
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,394
Yum.

163
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,106
If you're sad, just say so.

164
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,318
Why would I be sad?

165
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,153
Everything costs money.

166
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,529
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

167
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,241
-Spirits.
-Up.

168
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,121
Oh, boy.

169
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,318
Become a Cinderella?

170
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,028
What kind of dad are you?

171
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,696
What kind of dad
tells his daughter that?

172
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,327
My daughter,

173
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,914
a sense of shame
can't help you in life.

174
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,667
The courage to overcome
the sense of shame

175
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,127
is what puts food on the table.

176
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm not a beggar.

177
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,090
Why did you die on me?

178
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,968
What am I supposed
to do by myself?

179
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,930
My daughter,
don't worry about a thing.

180
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,349
There's something else
I left for you.

181
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,196
What the heck is this?

182
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,531
Dad!

183
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,199
Dad!

184
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,369
Help me. Help me!

185
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,080
Oh, help me!

186
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,835
Darn it.

187
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:37,132
PUMPKIN DREAM INTERPRETATION

188
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:42,721
"Fortune and happiness
will fill your life."

189
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,523
Hey, Seon-jeong, I just had
a dream about a pumpkin...

190
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,442
Hey, hey, they're
holding a wedding

191
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,611
at Chungdam Heaven today.
We should go.

192
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,154
Chungdam Heaven?

193
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,447
How?

194
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,742
A member of Chungdam Heaven
goes to my church

195
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,285
and told me about a couple who
are holding their wedding there

196
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,661
because they met there.

197
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,539
Okay, let's go

198
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:13,668
and see what
Chungdam Heaven is like.

199
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,652
Hello.

200
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,741
Sir, you brought
Chairman Ko here again?

201
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,786
There's no need to protect
yourself at a wedding, is there?

202
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,789
I should be extra careful
with more people around, no?

203
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,832
People are more dangerous
than anything.

204
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,584
Then you shouldn't have
come to the wedding.

205
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,086
But I had to.

206
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,463
It's being held
at Chungdam Heaven,

207
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,591
although I'm not
really happy for them.

208
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,651
That's dangerous.

209
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,528
Don't you get tired
of always being on guard?

210
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,738
Wouldn't you get suspicious
of a man who brings flowers

211
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,615
to a wedding covered in flowers?

212
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,244
Smile. One, two, three.
Let me take one more shot.

213
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,121
-Congratulations, Ha-jin.
-Thank you.

214
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,163
-One, two.
-You look beautiful.

215
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,336
How can love change?

216
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,171
You're not getting married.

217
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,341
Before I hand out pictures
from your past to everyone here,

218
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,801
come with me.

219
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,307
There's no downside
to feeling suspicious.

220
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,225
Safety first.

221
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,061
Who are you?

222
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,814
Get lost before I get physical.

223
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,608
Who says I don't want that?

224
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,526
Darn it.

225
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,446
Darn it!

226
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,379
Whoa.

227
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,090
Going this far for a fantasy
called love.

228
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:26,885
Thank you.

229
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,263
Smile.

230
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,682
My goodness, Prince Cha-min
is quite athletic.

231
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,892
He's like a prince.

232
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,144
Bride, enter.

233
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,952
By the way,

234
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,328
why does she have
to walk down the aisle

235
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,579
holding her dad's hand?

236
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,456
It's not like she
can't walk by herself.

237
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,626
It's an outdated tradition.

238
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,630
Still, I'm jealous of her

239
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,633
for being able to meet
her other half in her twenties

240
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,468
and starting
round two of her life

241
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,095
in such a nice place as this.

242
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,264
Round two?

243
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,057
Life isn't a game.

244
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,308
It sure is a game.

245
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,060
Round one is a game
of random chance.

246
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,437
Whether you have
rich parents or not.

247
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,980
Round two
is a game of selection.

248
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,607
Whether you select
a rich spouse or not.

249
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,736
You mean I have to get married

250
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,070
if I want to finish
this miserable round?

251
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,823
I guess you could work hard
and pave your own way

252
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,867
to finish the game,

253
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,160
but life is lonely,

254
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,746
so wouldn't it be nice
to have a partner

255
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,164
to play this long game with you?

256
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,293
I just want to log out.

257
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,669
Game over.

258
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,380
You look gorgeous.

259
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,757
Congratulations.

260
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,803
Wow, she's really beautiful.

261
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,974
-Sir.
-What is it?

262
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,059
-Look at your three o'clock.
-It's three o'clock?

263
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,187
I mean your three o'clock.

264
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,524
You're right.

265
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,693
She looks like

266
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,487
smooth marble.

267
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,654
Ah.

268
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,260
There are lots of rocks.

269
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:18,640
MOTTO: REGARD WOMEN
AS MERE ROCKS

270
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,187
This is
a beautiful show of love.

271
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,356
-I'm jealous.
-Welcome to the wedding...

272
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,357
She's pretty.

273
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,276
...of Park Byeong-hun
and Lee Ha-jin.

274
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,488
They go so well together,
like pizza and cheese.

275
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,447
They do.

276
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,075
I hope their life
together is a party.

277
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:44,082
That pumpkin kick
was for this pumpkin cake?

278
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,250
Are you kidding me?

279
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,546
You look so unappetizing.

280
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,340
You're so ugly.

281
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,676
I'll see you outside.

282
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,514
Mm, so pretty.

283
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,976
You're all I need, okay?

284
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,196
I guess I don't want it.

285
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,585
What's this?

286
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,299
Hermès?

287
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,641
Is this what they meant
by fortune?

288
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,767
No.

289
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:50,231
That pumpkin dream brought
something far more shocking.

290
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,733
You're pregnant?

291
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,612
It was a baby dream?

292
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,822
It happened the day
he gave me this ring.

293
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,285
We promised to love each other
eternally once again.

294
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,663
He didn't have any money,
so I don't know how he did it,

295
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,666
but he did anything
and everything for me.

296
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,711
He even borrowed money
to do anything and everything,

297
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,839
giving only love
until he died.

298
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,306
I was sure
he was going to pull through.

299
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,891
But he couldn't.

300
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:28,811
By the way...

301
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,730
uh...

302
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,360
he borrowed
a bit of money from me.

303
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,618
I WIRED 20 MILLION WON

304
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,702
CHECK YOUR ACCOUNT
AND LET ME KNOW

305
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,037
SHIN GWANG-SU: THANK YOU SO MUCH

306
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,080
I JUST CHECKED

307
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,505
I'll pay you back,
a little at a time.

308
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,719
Dad left me nothing but debt
after he passed away.

309
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,013
And in addition
to a little sibling,

310
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,059
that unbelievable man
lost the apartment.

311
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,854
Sir, stop placing
those stickers!

312
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,022
Darn it!

313
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,816
I'm going to beat you up,
Mr. Shin!

314
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:19,112
When I see you,
I'll tear you to pieces!

315
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,239
He's already dead, so too bad.

316
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,950
Ugh!
Mr. Shin's daughter, get lost.

317
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,744
Oh, seriously.

318
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,246
Hey, stop it.

319
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,081
Oh, seriously!

320
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,710
-How annoying.
-"Don't hit with a flower.

321
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,878
-I'm so annoyed.
-Punch with your fist"

322
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:36,963
is her motto,

323
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,507
but with the man
she wants to punch gone,

324
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,719
her surplus hissy-fit-energy
grew mightier.

325
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,863
2015: ALL ACCEPTED
IN EARLY ADMISSION

326
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,413
2015: ALL ACCEPTED
IN EARLY ADMISSION

327
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,336
SHIN JAE-RIM

328
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,796
The door is open.

329
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,089
-Hello.
-Hello.

330
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,591
-Mom.
-Your lunch.

331
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,763
I was starving.

332
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,765
-I bet you were.
-Yes.

333
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,434
One, two, three, tada.

334
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,686
That's my favorite.

335
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,483
-Is it good?
-Yes, really good.

336
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,942
The best.

337
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,152
Rolled omelet.

338
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,653
Ah.

339
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:49,577
Your food is the best
in the world, Mom.

340
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:00,171
2015: ALL ACCEPTED
IN EARLY ADMISSION

341
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,464
I'm sorry,

342
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,634
but the summer vacation course
is 1 million won.

343
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,010
What?

344
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,136
Oh...

345
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,597
I worked really hard
to earn money

346
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,516
so I could take
the summer course.

347
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,142
It's really expensive here.

348
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:17,688
Have you talked
to your parents about it?

349
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,693
If I had more money back then,

350
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,533
could I have found what I'm
good at and gotten a job?

351
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:32,703
No.

352
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,872
If I had what it takes,

353
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,332
I would've made it
by now somehow.

354
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,921
Why did Mr. Shin use
our apartment as collateral?

355
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,173
Why do I have to suffer
because of him?

356
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,759
Jae-rim should take
full responsibility.

357
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:47,718
It was my fault.

358
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,011
Why was that your fault?

359
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,430
Do you love him enough
to take the fault?

360
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,684
He co-signed
a loan for your aunt!

361
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,978
I didn't want to
even though she's family,

362
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,354
so he went ahead and did it,

363
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,856
hoping me and my big sister
wouldn't grow apart.

364
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,149
Did auntie go bankrupt?

365
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,233
Yes!

366
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,609
I wasn't going to tell you

367
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,028
so you could still enjoy
her kimchi, but whatever!

368
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:11,826
And even if he hadn't done it,
I would have in the end.

369
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,458
To be honest, I have no place
in this family either,

370
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,044
but I'm tagging along anyway.

371
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,174
Isn't there someplace I can go?

372
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,634
Oh.

373
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,263
Someplace where they
would love to have me.

374
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,433
How about Chungdam Heaven,

375
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,645
where bubbles and grumpiness
are floating all around?

376
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,066
Darn it.

377
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,863
Why don't you smoke instead?

378
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,448
You're making
the floor slippery.

379
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,368
I can't smoke
just because I'm stressed out.

380
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,329
Not when I'm the icon
of self-control.

381
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:57,788
A prince who smokes.

382
00:24:58,456 --> 00:24:59,707
I guess that looks weird.

383
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,709
Then do it outside.

384
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,419
No bubbles indoors.

385
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,422
I feel like

386
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,299
one of my employees
getting hitched

387
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,052
with one of the members
behind my back

388
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,428
has tarnished my reputation.

389
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,430
Why would that affect
your reputation?

390
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,435
You have no idea
what kind of agony I'm in.

391
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,604
Prince Cha-min has no idea

392
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:25,358
how agonizing
it is to be penniless.

393
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,171
The countless new Cinderellas
of this day and age

394
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,383
who are neither homeowners
nor rich,

395
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,551
keep your chins up.

396
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,859
I'm taking the bed,
so you sleep on the floor.

397
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,238
I can't sleep on the floor,
so you do it.

398
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,282
You already have a built-in
sleeping bag on your body.

399
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,617
You want me
to knock you out every night?

400
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,120
That way we wouldn't need
to discuss this.

401
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,668
I can't believe I have
to share this room

402
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:26,877
with her indefinitely.

403
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,463
Sosik, you were cold,
weren't you?

404
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,590
The housing cost in Seoul...

405
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,345
is crazier than this nutcase,
so I can't handle it.

406
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:40,558
Seoul's housing cost forced
Jae-rim to tolerate a nutcase

407
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:44,520
and this pregnant woman
to keep on working hard.

408
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,232
Teacher, is it okay
for you to do this

409
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,358
when you're pregnant?

410
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:50,943
Of course.

411
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,112
This isn't the kind of world
where a pregnant woman

412
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,113
can stay home and rest.

413
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,741
I have to work as long as I can.

414
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,453
Everybody, let's do this!

415
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,543
Nice.

416
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,420
Take your time.

417
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,006
To the back.

418
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,008
Look cute.

419
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:18,137
Shake your body
until your belly becomes flat.

420
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,263
Harder, harder!

421
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,348
Shake it hard!

422
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,641
Yes, keep going! Your belly...

423
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,452
You must have been worried sick.

424
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:45,081
Mom and the baby are all okay.

425
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,457
Just stay with her.

426
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,042
That will help her
feel reassured.

427
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,711
Okay.

428
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,854
Jae-rim,

429
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,731
-you didn't...
-Okay.

430
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,900
...have to rush over here.

431
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,611
I thought you were in trouble.

432
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,323
Getting pregnant
at such an old age...

433
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,783
I'm a nuisance, aren't I?

434
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,830
Though your dad's gone,

435
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,624
I'll be good to you.

436
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,503
I think Dad knew.

437
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:40,052
He appeared in my dream
and gave me a pumpkin.

438
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:43,180
I think it was a baby dream.

439
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,307
He gave you a pumpkin?

440
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,561
In your dream?

441
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,146
Yes.

442
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,357
So don't worry too much.

443
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,945
He gave you a pumpkin.

444
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,200
Thank you, Jae-rim.

445
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,827
I need to be there

446
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,079
for this sweet and kind woman
from now on, but...

447
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,498
Oh, how could I?

448
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,924
Oh, sweetie.

449
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,010
Oh, you must be hungry.

450
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,803
I'll get you some formula.

451
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,346
Hold on.

452
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,558
Can you hand me the formula?

453
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,060
Hey.

454
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,146
How can you eat
the baby's formula?

455
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,147
NAMYUNG POWDERED MILK

456
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,940
But I'm hungry!

457
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,066
Hwa-jin,

458
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,236
brush it back in.

459
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,407
I'm hungry.

460
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,121
We'll all end up
starving to death.

461
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,372
What do I do?

462
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,920
Start a business?

463
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,005
Ugh, but I don't have any money.

464
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,175
Get a job?

465
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,054
Without any experience,
my resume will get tossed out.

466
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,056
I'm getting older,

467
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,226
and my responsibilities
are increasing.

468
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:15,564
What can I do in this situation?

469
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,248
Oh, no!

470
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,335
Try just one last time.

471
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,382
These machines aren't beatable,
and I don't need any dolls.

472
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,098
Dad doesn't know anything.

473
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:01,485
See?

474
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,153
When it comes to life,
you never know.

475
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,822
You have to go all the way.

476
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,490
Jae-rim...

477
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:08,909
life...

478
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,370
is a gamble.

479
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,386
SOCIAL CLUB HEAVEN:
HIRING ANGEL MANAGER

480
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,846
Round two
is a game of selection.

481
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,640
Whether you select
a rich spouse or not.

482
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,645
Yes, let's give it a try.

483
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,105
Let's roll the dice

484
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,108
and see if I can change
my life through marriage.

485
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,653
Chungdam Heaven.

486
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,032
I can do this.

487
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:55,164
Did I gain weight?

488
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,756
She was the kind of girl
who was good at utilizing

489
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,425
the things available
around her.

490
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,676
Oh, seriously.

491
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,721
Being a country that has
a national exercise routine,

492
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:15,392
the parks here are equipped
with free exercise machines.

493
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,271
So, instead of paying
for a personal trainer,

494
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:20,856
she picked up
secret techniques

495
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,067
from the village masters.

496
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,494
Bye-bye.

497
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,620
Bye.

498
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,583
It fits, it fits.

499
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,670
Whoa, I guess exercising worked.

500
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,049
Well, I could be a model.

501
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,265
What the heck?

502
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,934
Did I exercise too much?

503
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,355
My shoulders look nice, but...

504
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,819
Shin Jae-rim,
it's time for a fast.

505
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,077
Fasting.

506
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,001
It's the poisoned chalice
the people often choose

507
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,794
when they go on a diet.

508
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,303
That's life.

509
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,223
You end up in a situation
where you must do it

510
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,268
even though it's bad for you.

511
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,364
Wow.

512
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,249
You're stinking up
the room. Eat outside.

513
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,919
You get out.
This is my room, too.

514
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,295
Oh, seriously.

515
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,633
And you stink, too.

516
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:53,801
Why?

517
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,010
You farted.

518
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,262
Stop stuffing your face!

519
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:02,059
Is my vegetarian diet making
me feel hungry all the time?

520
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:06,522
Like how herbivores are
always chewing on something,

521
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,567
Hwa-jin, who's
on a vegetarian diet,

522
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:14,696
kept on eating because
she felt hungry all the time.

523
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,626
Sports drink.

524
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,169
I need more of the sports drink.

525
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,048
Sports...

526
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,310
What's that sound?

527
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,191
What are you doing?

528
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,242
Are you nuts?

529
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,120
You said
you weren't going to eat!

530
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,705
You said
you were going vegetarian!

531
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:05,998
Hey.

532
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,791
You can't eat like this!

533
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,126
Why not?

534
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:11,545
Let's mix them up.

535
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,881
Excellent suggestion!

536
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,173
Yes!

537
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,635
I'm going to dump
all the ham in there.

538
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,304
-Do it now.
-I'm dumping them all in.

539
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,722
I'm so excited.

540
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,475
Your aunt's kimchi.

541
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,022
Should I put it in?

542
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:31,732
Get that out of my sight.

543
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,363
Let's get rid of it
by eating it,

544
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,157
since I can't stand
the sight of it.

545
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:43,201
Yes, get rid of it by shoving
it down our throats.

546
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,454
-Nice.
-Let's eat, let's eat. Eat up.

547
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,622
Sometimes in life,

548
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,833
today's happiness
brings tomorrow's misery.

549
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,461
-I think I'm going to cry.
-Isn't it beyond delicious?

550
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:56,089
However, our leading lady
is undeterred.

551
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,179
My face is so puffy.

552
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,514
It's okay, I can fix it.

553
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,477
Dab away, keep dabbing hard.

554
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,020
Oh!

555
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,856
Yes, the swelling is going down.

556
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,524
Do you want me to pat for you?

557
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,694
I have a strong punch, so I bet
it'll work better on your skin.

558
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,364
I can't believe what I did
with you last night.

559
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,783
My face looks so swollen.

560
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,326
You were going to be
either a dried squid

561
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,286
or a semi-dried squid.
Same difference.

562
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,166
I can fix this.

563
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:35,337
I can use makeup to paint
my dream on my face.

564
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,340
I am... not a squid!

565
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:44,054
I'm an octopus,
a dreaming octopus

566
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:57,818
Huh?

567
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,363
Oh!

568
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,531
Now that I'm swollen,

569
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,991
I can fit into Su-jin's
luxury brand heels.

570
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,075
Lucky me.

571
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,913
Take me to a nice place,
Su-jin's heels.

572
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:19,840
This peculiar girl who may
or may not be a Cinderella

573
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,592
is making her way
into her destiny.

574
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,602
Be it ash-covered Cinderella
or dirt-covered broke girl,

575
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,355
she needs to look fabulous

576
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,984
if she wants magic
in her life.

577
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,752
Here is the list of candidates
for the interview.

578
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,253
CHUNGDAM HEAVEN CLUB
INTERVIEW CANDIDATES

579
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,672
I'm hiring
someone who will last.

580
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,050
I'm jealous of Shin-hye.

581
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,843
Who knew she would get married
and leave so quickly?

582
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,553
Is that the power of love?

583
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,263
Do you think that's true love?

584
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,307
I'm sure she did
the math in her head.

585
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,518
Love is something
your head has no control over.

586
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,437
It's controlled by your heart.

587
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:19,441
Actually, it's controlled
by your brain, okay?

588
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,110
It's only an interaction
of pointless sex hormones.

589
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,279
Why are sex hormones pointless?

590
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,782
When they are used well,
they can improve a person.

591
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,575
It makes you want
to be more attractive,

592
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,243
and that can lead to having
a more attractive kid.

593
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,661
I already have many kids.

594
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,788
What?

595
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,122
Oh, I knew it.

596
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,166
Since you're
a rich 8th-gen heir...

597
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,459
Kids out of wedlock?

598
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:42,839
Look.

599
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:44,633
Yawu.

600
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,844
Qwami.

601
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,555
Kuekuya.

602
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,934
I'm sponsoring lots of children.

603
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,895
Wow, I had no idea.

604
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,689
I'm like the deep sea,
don't you think?

605
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,068
I have depth and I'm very pure.

606
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,278
Are you sure
it's not for tax benefits?

607
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,158
It breaks my heart
to hear you twist

608
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:13,620
a rich man's
good will like that.

609
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,665
Get out.

610
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,083
Excuse me.

611
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,925
I miss you.

612
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,975
INTERVIEW ROOM

613
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,027
"I'm glad you applied.

614
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,864
You need to test
your luck for success!

615
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,782
Once you make it
into Chungdam Heaven,

616
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,702
start tossing glass slippers
around and see."

617
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,037
Glass slippers...

618
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,419
Did I get lucky already?

619
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,632
Father, are you finally
helping me out?

620
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,885
I'm going to sue you.

621
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,094
Why?

622
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,138
Did I steal your heart
or something?

623
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,098
Do you want my number?

624
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,102
What are you talking about?

625
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,482
Attempted murder.

626
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,487
"Attempted murder?"

627
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,283
How tragic.

628
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,994
Shaba, shaba, oh, eff it.

629
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,165
Let's wait and see
what happens to them.

630
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,875
Until next time.

631
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,628
Kidults everywhere, goodbye.
