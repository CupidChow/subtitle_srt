1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:12,221
DREAMING OF FREAKING FAIRY TALE

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,141
Finding my soulmate.

3
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,354
There is a prince
born to be a king...

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,070
and a man with six-pack abs.

5
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:33,200
A man who has enjoyed
an affluent lifestyle

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,496
and a man who worked hard
and became successful.

7
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,833
Which of these two
would you like to be with?

8
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,084
Personally,

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,211
I'd go with the one
who's good to me.

10
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,142
My goodness,

11
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,602
is this really happening?

12
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,315
BIG MAN!

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,691
"Big man"?

14
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,027
No, don't.

15
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:14,992
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,122
I checked it, wondering why
you threw yourself to catch it,

17
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,041
but I guess I shouldn't have.

18
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,002
-"Big man"?
-It's not what you're thinking.

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,463
In that case,
could I see it again?

20
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,382
No.

21
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,802
Just kidding.

22
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,430
You looked embarrassed,
so I wanted to tease you.

23
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:38,557
Please excuse my behavior.

24
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,397
But what should
we do about the button?

25
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,153
It's okay. I can sew it back on.

26
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:54,156
He's a very polite, rich man.

27
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,835
Who knew men like him existed?

28
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,557
He's magnificent yet cute.

29
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,020
He's both rough and demure.

30
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,316
An extraordinary man who makes
disharmony appear harmonious.

31
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,530
Mission possible boy!

32
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,917
Perhaps he is

33
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,795
my dream man sent from heaven.

34
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,592
This must be your first visit.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,926
Let me show you inside.

36
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,179
Ouch.

37
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,891
Please give us a minute.

38
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,938
Yeong-bae, I'll do it.

39
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,274
Mr. Moon won't
let you consult a man.

40
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:12,985
He said I could now.

41
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,278
-Really?
-Yes.

42
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,823
I don't believe you.

43
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,783
Did you grow up
being conned by everyone?

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,494
Do you want to get beaten up?
I have permission.

45
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,094
Boss.

46
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,763
Boss?

47
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,432
You want to consult him?

48
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,226
Have Yeong-bae do it.

49
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,522
You're changing your mind again?

50
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,399
You said I could start
on my regular duties today.

51
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,234
I'd like to talk to this lady.

52
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,905
We've already become acquainted.

53
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,078
Does he also...

54
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,455
think I am his destiny?

55
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,631
But...

56
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,426
he looks way too young.

57
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,303
Will he be
my little bridegroom?

58
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,393
But he's too big
to be a little bridegroom.

59
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,902
Why are you staring
at me like that?

60
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,321
May I ask how old you are?

61
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,865
I turned 30 this year.

62
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,366
I thought
you were 20 years old.

63
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,786
Looking young is
a strength these days,

64
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,288
so how do you do it?

65
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,459
I drink and smoke.

66
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,546
I think all my hormones go
to my body instead of my face.

67
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,757
You must have
very smart hormones.

68
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,717
Being a movie director,

69
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,594
I had a pretty tough life.

70
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,345
You're a movie director?

71
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,764
Yes.

72
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,475
I'm Director Baek Do-hong.

73
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,268
Director Baek Do-hong?

74
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,187
The youngest winner of
the White Dragon Film Festival's

75
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,605
Best Director award?

76
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,856
So you know me.

77
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,110
You must be into movies.

78
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,154
I totally love movies!

79
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,074
I'm trying to take a break,

80
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,159
and I heard
this is just the place.

81
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,452
That's true.

82
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,831
But I heard
it's really hard to join.

83
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,626
We accepted
resort membership holders

84
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,710
when we first opened,

85
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,879
and we haven't been
accepting new members.

86
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,632
Or if you have a VIP invitation,

87
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,425
you can join
under special conditions.

88
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,136
Since I don't have
an invitation,

89
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,596
I should ask to be
put on the waitlist.

90
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,973
R-Right.

91
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,561
Since I'm not good
at waiting with no deadline,

92
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,355
I should look for another place.

93
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,857
Oh, wait.

94
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,443
I will make
your special membership happen.

95
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,695
Because you are

96
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,698
my very important person.

97
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,119
My wish paper

98
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,745
is your invitation!

99
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,916
I noticed that you put Jae-rim
on regular duties today.

100
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,544
I told you
I'm not attracted to her.

101
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,837
That's great.

102
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,046
I'll have a front-row seat

103
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,840
to witness her Cinderella
dream come true.

104
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,803
Are you gonna keep
showing up at my work?

105
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,054
You have to stop.

106
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,105
-Hello.
-Hi.

107
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,023
If it's not important,
come back later.

108
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,817
It's okay. You can go ahead.

109
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,280
Please offer a membership

110
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,198
to Mr. Baek Do-hong,
who just came,

111
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,786
And if I say no?
I don't accept just anyone.

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,079
Put him on the waiting list.

113
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,165
But he's not just anyone.

114
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,750
He's a really
famous movie director.

115
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,836
Chungdam Heaven
is a cultural society,

116
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,671
so who could be better suited?

117
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,673
I agree. A movie director
would be a great addition.

118
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,803
Jae-rim, are you so eager

119
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,890
because you really like the guy?

120
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,311
Yes.

121
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,480
If I let him leave,

122
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,649
I will wake up crying,
eat while crying,

123
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,986
and cry nonstop
every day in front of you.

124
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,782
We need to talk about
business. You should go.

125
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,160
Okay, since my honey

126
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,287
and I have come to an agreement,

127
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,956
I will go.

128
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,594
Why should I accept him?

129
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,971
And why are you acting this way?
Are you sick?

130
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,598
You told me earlier

131
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,351
that even if I tried,
I could never be a Cinderella.

132
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,772
Stop dismissing me for no reason

133
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,398
and give me a chance.

134
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,484
Let's see if I can pull it off.

135
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,739
You really...

136
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,116
don't feel any shame for your
materialistic nature, do you?

137
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,451
Now that you've shown me
your true colors,

138
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,328
-you're going all out?
-I am ashamed.

139
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,623
I would love to be
graceful and all,

140
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,375
but if I did that, I wouldn't be
able to get anything

141
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,501
or anywhere.

142
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,798
You pester me too much.

143
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,093
You can do whatever you want,

144
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,845
but please,

145
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:14,972
please leave me alone.

146
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,349
Are you giving me
your permission?

147
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,144
Yes, I will let him join,

148
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,230
so take him
and get out of my sight.

149
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,026
Thank you.

150
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,168
Oh, my goodness...

151
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,840
-Are you okay?
-Women in romantic stories

152
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,342
would trip on flat,
stoneless ground

153
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,761
and fall into
the arms a man like him.

154
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,515
But my legs are strong.

155
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,768
If only something
would happen.

156
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,231
-Did you register him?
-Yes.

157
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,442
I finished up before
you change your mind,

158
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,068
and he is leaving now.

159
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,448
Thank you for letting me join.

160
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,288
If you're finished,
you should get going.

161
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,060
Why did you follow us out here?

162
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,521
Hey, Shin Jae-rim,
I told you that you smell.

163
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,690
-Get away from me.
-Oh, no.

164
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,620
Jae-rim, you smell nice.

165
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,083
-Excuse me?
-Why would you eat your hair?

166
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,636
"Why would you eat your hair?"

167
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,891
Jae-rim,

168
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,228
eat this instead of your hair.

169
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,232
I was able to join
thanks to you,

170
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,193
so I'll buy you
more in the future.

171
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,449
This isn't candy but love.

172
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,037
She's getting
ahead of herself.

173
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,499
I'll see you
at the welcoming party.

174
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,168
See you at the party.

175
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,429
See you at the party.

176
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,474
No, you won't be able to.

177
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,644
Why not? The welcoming party
will need the Angel Manager.

178
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,479
You have to put your personal
needs aside when you work.

179
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,022
You think you can
take advantage of me?

180
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,482
I'm saying

181
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,193
I will work very hard,
wholeheartedly.

182
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,029
Before you start
working, tie your hair.

183
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,739
You look like a virgin ghost.

184
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,243
I almost became one,

185
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,494
if it hadn't been for you.

186
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,204
Unbelievable.

187
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,887
Prince Cha-min,
who used to regard women

188
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,305
as nothing but rocks,

189
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,476
has become Prince Mola Mola,

190
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,979
whose heart skips a beat
whenever he sees Jae-rim.

191
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,066
Hey, hurry up.

192
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,238
There's something
you need to do before the party.

193
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,032
Huh?

194
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,246
Cover this wall
with new paintings.

195
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,915
Commission them yourself.

196
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,542
He's like an evil stepmother.

197
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,004
It's a party, so why
do you need paintings?

198
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,756
Baek Do-hong
isn't special enough

199
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,716
to throw a welcoming party.

200
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,552
But you always hold
one for new members.

201
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,388
It's up to me.

202
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,224
This time I'm also
holding a themed exhibition.

203
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,808
What kind of theme?

204
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,188
Mismatched.

205
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,109
Okay, I will help you.

206
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,486
What should I do?

207
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,613
Help? No, you're in charge.

208
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,365
It's a party for the man

209
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,533
you made me accept
because you like him.

210
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,536
So if you fail
to get new paintings,

211
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,746
you can't attend the party.

212
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,123
What?

213
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,333
I will introduce you
to the artist.

214
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,877
That should make it easier.

215
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,507
Mr. Moon,

216
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,219
art isn't something you can
produce at the snap of a finger.

217
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,720
You know that, don't you?

218
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,723
Hey, seriously,

219
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,725
you should just do
what I tell you.

220
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,652
How can he just leave
carrying his umbrella like that?

221
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,237
Think of your credit card
bills and hang in there.

222
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,655
It's that umbrella.

223
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,658
Hey, do you want to steal
that umbrella with me?

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,328
That would be terrible.

225
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,290
It's not just an umbrella.
It's Chairman Ko.

226
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,125
Chairman Ko?

227
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,377
Could it be...

228
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,009
I now bestow the family's
lucky umbrella unto you.

229
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,595
The lucky one always wins.

230
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,432
Thank you.

231
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,394
The rich family's
lucky heirloom.

232
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,062
Should I borrow it?

233
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,230
You think he'll let you?

234
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,740
Seriously.

235
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,744
But Mr. Moon

236
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,204
has never accepted
a new member this quickly.

237
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,789
I wonder what he's thinking.

238
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,042
Him giving Jae-rim a job
was weird in the first place.

239
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,420
I don't care what he's thinking.

240
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,631
The issue here is how
to put together the exhibition

241
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,132
within the deadline.

242
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,010
When Mr. Moon
isn't here, we'll help you.

243
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,845
Contact that artist first.

244
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,722
-You mean that?
-Yes.

245
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,684
I've never been surrounded
by such helpful people before.

246
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,144
I will take you out someday.

247
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:37,479
Jae-rim,

248
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,398
do you think empty
promises will work here?

249
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,485
-Huh?
-Hmm, let me see, hmm...

250
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,197
Pizza! I want pizza.

251
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,199
Let's get pizza first
and then have a meeting, okay?

252
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,453
Margherita, margherita,

253
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,746
one margherita and,

254
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,915
for me, triple cheese bomb

255
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,249
plus extra cheese.

256
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,501
Okay.

257
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,169
Enjoy.

258
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,173
Oh, it's ready.

259
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,426
Yeong-bae,
we should all eat together.

260
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,011
I'm gonna eat on the way.

261
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,013
I can hold it with one hand as
I eat, so it's very convenient.

262
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,223
How long is that?

263
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,974
It's huge for one portion.

264
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,477
-Here.
-Whoa.

265
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,646
And none for you.

266
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,606
Wow, this looks good.

267
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,488
Their pizza is really good.

268
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,701
What is wrong with people?

269
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,953
They aren't mindful or cautious.

270
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,663
In a world where even
your oldest friends betray you,

271
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,373
how can you fall
for someone you just met?

272
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,419
Who is the man talking
to himself, full of anger?

273
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,756
The 108 earthly
desires come from within.

274
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,273
Finally, he is seeing things.

275
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,234
Everything is
created in the mind!

276
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,873
You're all talk.

277
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,628
I am your teacher.

278
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,719
You picked a good one.

279
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,847
Oh.

280
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:38,808
Hello.

281
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,310
Who schedules
a last minute meeting

282
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,895
like it's a guerilla attack?

283
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
It is a guerilla attack.

284
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm very sorry,
but this is an emergency.

285
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,197
And we need a large number.

286
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,492
Since I'm a new artist,
I must comply?

287
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,787
Isn't it upsetting?

288
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,956
Use this exhibition
to make your name known.

289
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,708
We can pay you a lot.

290
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,003
But, uh, do you think
you can handle it by yourself?

291
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,379
Of course.

292
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,839
Because I'm a genius.

293
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,382
-A genius.
-A genius.

294
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,468
He's a genius.

295
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,310
What's going on?

296
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,062
Why is everyone
sitting with her?

297
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,024
You know how you run
into things or people in life

298
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,360
you think are badly
matched, don't you?

299
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,237
Like buldak noodles?

300
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,989
You suffer when
you eat it, but you can't stop.

301
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,407
Mint chocolate is a bad match.

302
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,534
MINT CHOCOLATE

303
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,077
You can't call that art.

304
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,538
I can't do that kind of art.

305
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,623
There's no right
answer in art, is there?

306
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,209
Let's not agonize over it.

307
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,544
Just do it.

308
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,962
You're a genius,

309
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,880
so you should be able to, right?

310
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,550
If I tell her to cancel it...

311
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,135
Oh, what should I...

312
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,319
BAN DAN-AH, ANSWER

313
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,821
I'll come to your house.

314
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,531
Let's finish our conversation.

315
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,782
I'm not home right now.

316
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,158
I'm going somewhere
to get some rest.

317
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,160
Where? Namyangju?

318
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,287
Or Kyoto?

319
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,040
Somewhere very old
you don't know about.

320
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,968
MISMATCHED

321
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,264
Oh, boy.

322
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,607
My name is Baek Do-hong.

323
00:19:55,987 --> 00:20:00,158
Dad, I think I just
might get my wish.

324
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,994
This has never happened before,

325
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,665
but I guess it might be because
someone is praying for me.

326
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,216
Insane.

327
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,801
She's communicating
with a stuffed animal.

328
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,473
She's weird, isn't she, Sosik?

329
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,060
Don't eat your hair.
Eat this instead.

330
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,523
Hey, how...
how could you eat that?

331
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,442
Do you know what
kind of candy that is?

332
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,818
A candy is a candy.

333
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,446
It's not even that good.

334
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,325
That's no ordinary candy!

335
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,827
How could
you eat that, you jerk!

336
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,496
What? Jerk?

337
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,956
You come here.

338
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,791
Let me show you
what a jerk can do.

339
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,501
You ate my candy,

340
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,503
-you jerk!
-Come here!

341
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,099
Please be careful.

342
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,147
Thank you.

343
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,150
Wow.

344
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,030
There wasn't much time,
but it came out pretty nice.

345
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,079
Oh, nice.

346
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,165
Where is
our mother-in-law of a boss?

347
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,959
Did he lose Chairman Ko?

348
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,293
He said he didn't
feel like coming in today.

349
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,962
Huh?

350
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,046
It's nice.

351
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,054
Being the boss, he can
slack off whenever he wants.

352
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,852
How can he not show up

353
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,353
after giving me so much work?

354
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,400
He told me I smell

355
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,402
and belittled me, saying
I could never be a Cinderella.

356
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,653
How can he be so rude to me?

357
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,405
I'm still a woman, am I not?

358
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,407
I can't believe that woman.

359
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,908
She treats me like a doormat.

360
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,077
Do I look that weak?
Does she think I'm a joke?

361
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,537
He doesn't think
about what he says.

362
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,998
He's fine one minute,
but he disappears the next.

363
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,624
He said I was fun to be with,

364
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,001
but I'm not just
a toy, you know.

365
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,419
I'm not gonna let
his whims sway me.

366
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,755
Her heart is so easily swayed.

367
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,214
She falls for a man she just met

368
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,841
and demanded
I offer him a membership.

369
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,009
She just has to get her way.

370
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,177
Just because he's the boss.

371
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,845
Maybe she should be the boss.

372
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,347
I can't take this anymore,

373
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,141
so I'm gonna get out
of here as soon as I can.

374
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,601
Oh, whatever.

375
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,269
I hope she leaves
as soon as possible.

376
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,690
ONCE MORE, EVEN IF IT HURTS

377
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,941
My goodness.

378
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,068
Hey!

379
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,277
She caught them.

380
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,071
You bastard! You bastard!

381
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,489
My goodness.

382
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,326
When I'm dead, you'll be
able to do anything you want.

383
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,911
How can he say that?

384
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,456
You can meet anyone
you want when I'm gone.

385
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,208
-Unbelievable.
-What?

386
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,376
This is my last chance.

387
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,504
I'm...

388
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,963
He's gonna pass out.

389
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,007
He's dying. Oh, poor thing.
I think he's gonna die.

390
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,009
I'll spend
my time left loving.

391
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,180
So just let us
love each other!

392
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,266
My goodness.

393
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,024
Oh, my!

394
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,442
Both of them?

395
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,321
Hooray for being single.

396
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,949
No, when you marry a few times,

397
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,492
one might turn out good.

398
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,035
It's not easy to get it
right the first time.

399
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,621
KOO NAM-HOON

400
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,960
My future sister-in-law,

401
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,545
she turned me down.

402
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,089
Should I have gotten
a diamond the size of a grape?

403
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,049
The size probably
had nothing to do with it.

404
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,677
Su-jin doesn't
care for stuff like that.

405
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,346
What should I do now?

406
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,307
How would I know?

407
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,976
If she said no, that's it.

408
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:57,854
Are you serious?

409
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,022
If you switch sides now,
you'll be sorry.

410
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,108
Do you want to pay me back now?

411
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,943
Don't be so cheap.

412
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,404
Hey, sis.

413
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,198
-I'm home.
-Come in.

414
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,786
Please tell me
what your big sister likes.

415
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,246
Did you eat?

416
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,706
No.

417
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,249
Oh, I'm hungry.

418
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,751
What do you feel like having?

419
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:21,961
My big sister

420
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,755
loves Mom the most.

421
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,259
So be good to our mom.

422
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,730
I can't believe I had
almost forgotten this face.

423
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,112
I see a resemblance...

424
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:32,615
with Shin Jae-rim.

425
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,041
Now I understand...

426
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,464
why I felt fond of her...

427
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,261
and why I can't stand her.

428
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,952
Her life may be
full of danger,

429
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,121
but there's a man
who is protecting her.

430
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,455
Huh?

431
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,252
Do-hong?

432
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,129
Don't climb down.

433
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:37,513
My goodness, he didn't
have to carry her down.

434
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,810
Romance sometimes
requires going overboard.

435
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,114
Jae-rim.

436
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,907
-Yes?
-Are you okay?

437
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,075
Yes.

438
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,285
I'll clean this up.

439
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,578
Okay.

440
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,166
He carried me.

441
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,918
Is he really my dream man?

442
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,172
Maybe you're
working too hard for the party.

443
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,424
It's your party, so I must.

444
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,634
Still, you should take it easy.

445
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:16,886
Should I?

446
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,556
In that case...
how about a drink?

447
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,183
Sure.

448
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,936
Let's get a mojito
and have a toast, to you.

449
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,855
You can have two.

450
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,067
Please excuse me.

451
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,705
I can't do this anymore.
Sorry.

452
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,416
Why now when things
are going so great...

453
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,094
Where did he go?

454
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,178
Where did he...

455
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,181
That bastard.

456
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,016
He knew this
would happen, didn't he?

457
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:15,653
Oh.

458
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,828
-Hey.
-Whoa.

459
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:24,995
Whoa.

460
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,122
Don't come any closer.

461
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:27,998
I just want to talk.

462
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,000
Leave me alone.

463
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,379
An artist needs
his time alone in his hole!

464
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,172
If you don't come out
of that hole this instant,

465
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,674
it'll be your grave, okay?

466
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,300
Hey!

467
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,635
You little jerk. Hey!

468
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:40,970
Hey!

469
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,180
-Hey!
-Darn it.

470
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:44,682
I said stop!

471
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,267
Oh, seriously...

472
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,896
When I see someone running away,

473
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,607
I get this urge to catch him,
like I'm a dog.

474
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,776
When I catch you,
I will bite you!

475
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,112
Swoosh!

476
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,891
Ouch.

477
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,018
She used
a special tool to catch him.

478
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,604
I asked you to talk.

479
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,522
Now my feet hurt.

480
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,024
Ouch.

481
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,487
Painting what I wanted
to paint was better.

482
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,075
Getting paid to paint
what the client wants...

483
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,243
I hate it now.

484
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,745
I'm gonna quit!

485
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,747
You shouldn't do that.

486
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,208
You shouldn't
give up what you love.

487
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,293
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

488
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,503
Speaking from experience?

489
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,297
Yes.

490
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,800
So no matter how hard,
don't give up what you love.

491
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,011
I really hate this.

492
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,387
This world sucks.

493
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,224
Yes, just pour it
all out and keep going!

494
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,309
Do whatever it takes
to become successful

495
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,727
in this miserable world
and live freely

496
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,729
like a bird afterwards, okay?

497
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,272
Wouldn't that be nice?

498
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,774
Like a bird, my ass.

499
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,275
You sound like an old woman.

500
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:23,197
Forget it.

501
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,699
Tonight

502
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,118
I will burn
the midnight oil, not you.

503
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,755
Whoa,

504
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,967
I'm a bit out of practice,
but it's not bad.

505
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,052
Maybe I shouldn't have given up.

506
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:52,434
Still, my other dream is about
to come true, so it's okay.

507
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,270
Whatever happens,

508
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,063
I'm gonna become happy.

509
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,588
How did you get here?

510
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,216
I came because
I have something to tell you.

511
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,344
What made you so fearless?

512
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,638
How dare you come here?

513
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,852
Why should I be afraid of you?

514
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:37,980
Huh?

515
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,905
I've been going easy on you.

516
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,950
I've been trying
to control myself,

517
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,368
trying very hard.

518
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,496
Why should you do that?

519
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,583
I don't like your dream,

520
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,878
I don't like
you seeing Baek Do-hong,

521
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,341
and I don't like you.

522
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,384
Then what should I do?

523
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,095
Should I disappear?

524
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,684
Why can't you just
admit that you like me?

525
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,230
Would you like me to help you?

526
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,886
That was a dream?

527
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,615
What I meant
by mismatched wasn't this.

528
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,785
Really?

529
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,789
Give me an example,
even though it's too late.

530
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,083
Even though it's too late,

531
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,543
Hmm...

532
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,463
you and me.

533
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,890
Why did you work so hard?

534
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,769
Was it because of that guy?
Or is this who you are?

535
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,774
I'm not the kind of person
who works really hard.

536
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,192
Are you stupid?

537
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,528
You did all this.

538
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:51,822
You should've used this energy
to try to make something

539
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:52,990
of yourself,

540
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,367
instead of getting a job
here for an unsavory goal.

541
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,497
Okay.

542
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,832
A promise is a promise,

543
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,667
so you can attend the party.

544
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,797
And reach your unsavory goal
as quickly as you can and leave.

545
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:09,965
I will.

546
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,594
By the way,

547
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,430
are you rooting for me

548
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,808
or do you just hate me?

549
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,990
Take this off before you go.

550
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,535
If you stay here,

551
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,329
I don't think I can
continue to control myself.

552
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,919
I mean you might as well
wear something pretty.

553
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,796
The party starts at night.

554
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,007
Oh.

555
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,685
The mismatched party
has begun.

556
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,521
BULDAK AND LARGE INTESTINES

557
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,190
This place
is full of problems.

558
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,025
CHOCOLATE AND CHICKEN

559
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,903
What's potent
has become more potent,

560
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,697
and likes and dislikes
have been taken to extremes.

561
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:20,202
But that can actually end up
attracting more people

562
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,037
who are crazy about it.

563
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,497
MISMATCHED

564
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,584
I let her come,
but she doesn't show up.

565
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,545
What is she doing?

566
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,383
The slave is here!

567
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,887
Whoa,

568
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,974
even the slave
looks stunning dressed up.

569
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,978
I can't tell
who the slave is anymore.

570
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:53,318
I don't know, what should I do
When I look into your eyes

571
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:57,155
Fall for you

572
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,577
When you look at me

573
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,288
When you smile at me

574
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,582
Fall in love

575
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,753
When I rest in your arms

576
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,590
Because of your warmth

577
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,759
Feel at ease

578
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,805
You have plentiful charms

579
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,891
How can I

580
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,769
Not love you?

581
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,023
I found him.

582
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,819
My man.

583
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,803
The exhibition was rushed.

584
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,389
They all look
a little off, don't they?

585
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,645
Fearless, wild genius.

586
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,397
I love how raw they are.

587
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,025
Especially this one.

588
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,902
I can feel something.

589
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,238
Let me tell you a secret.

590
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,325
I painted this one.

591
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,124
Let me tell you a secret.

592
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,585
Next time, paint me.

593
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,886
Is this how it feels

594
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,514
to have my dream come true?

595
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,185
Director Baek Do-hong,
the man of the hour.

596
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:51,687
My name is Lina.

597
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,147
Her family owns
Hyuseong Electronics.

598
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,067
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

599
00:37:57,234 --> 00:38:01,029
It's great to be in Chungdam
Heaven with you, Director Baek.

600
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,781
Who invited you?

601
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,074
It wasn't by invitation.

602
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,660
He joined thanks to the new
manager's recommendation.

603
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,081
She begged to let him join.

604
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,334
Oh, I didn't know
that was possible.

605
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,712
Are you two close?

606
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,879
No.

607
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,883
I met her here,
but she worked so hard for me,

608
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,218
so I'm very grateful.

609
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,803
Oh.

610
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:26,930
I wonder why you did that.

611
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,392
You don't have
a secret motive, do you?

612
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,396
Hoping in vain that you might be
able to become a Cinderella

613
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,981
like the former manager.

614
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,738
Why not?

615
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:45,574
I don't get people
like that at all.

616
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,035
If they need money,
they should come to my house

617
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,327
and work for me.

618
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,413
I can pay you a lot.

619
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,165
Would you like
to come work for me?

620
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,087
No.

621
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,590
I'm going to focus
on my job here.

622
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:03,842
Really?

623
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,595
Then bring me a drink.

624
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,223
Of course.

625
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,024
I'm embarrassed of my dream.

626
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,943
But without my dream,

627
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,945
I'll be stuck with this life.

628
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:26,740
All right.

629
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,617
I just need to focus
on Baek Do-hong.

630
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,627
Here is your drink.

631
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,964
Who asked for mint chocolate?

632
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,759
I hate that stuff.

633
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,470
It's an instinct

634
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,639
to reach out and grab
something when you're falling,

635
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,683
so who can blame her?

636
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,522
Look what you did!

637
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,861
How could you do this to me?

638
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,698
I'm sorry,

639
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,033
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,536
Oh, seriously.

641
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,179
Have her clean up
here and let it go.

642
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,182
It looked like a mistake.

643
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,854
Her life is miserable because
she makes mistakes like this.

644
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,363
I can't believe
I mistook him to be my destiny

645
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,492
when I'm destined

646
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:54,911
to be hopeless.

647
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,114
How can you make
a mistake like this?

648
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,829
When mistakes like this
pile up, they lead to trouble.

649
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,335
I love...

650
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:48,048
mint chocolate.

651
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,928
My goodness, was that...

652
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,930
a profession of love?

653
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,377
Prince Cha-min got slapped

654
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,629
for confessing his love
to the wrong person.

655
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:35,136
What will happen to Prince
Cha-min and New-derella now?

656
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,683
You'll find out next time.
