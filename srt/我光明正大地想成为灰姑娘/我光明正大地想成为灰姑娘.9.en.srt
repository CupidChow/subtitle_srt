(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,439
- You trust me, right? - Yes.

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,320
Even the fear inside you...

4
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,199
depends on how you tame it.

5
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,758
(Shall we go on a walk?)

6
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,719
How about a walk after a sausage?

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,280
So don't run away.

8
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,199
Try to face your fear.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,840
(Episode 9: An Unpredictable Magical Cave)

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,840
Simply believing in love will help you greatly.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,799
And I want to help you.

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,879
Help you take another step forward.

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,920
Cha Min?

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,400
I'll listen to your story until the end, at least.

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
That will make me feel more at ease.

16
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,759
One more time.

17
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Can you give me a hug?

18
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,560
It was tough, right?

19
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,879
Yes.

20
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,960
But it was nice.

21
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Thanks.

22
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,759
Shin Jae Rim.

23
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,080
(Chungdam Heaven)

24
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,039
Meeting my mom made me happy.

25
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,599
But I'm not sure if I can forgive her.

26
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
How come?

27
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,120
My dad was in total misery.

28
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,360
I felt bad for your mother than him.

29
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,879
She was looked down upon before her son.

30
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,919
True.

31
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,560
Despite hearing all that, has your dream not changed?

32
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,120
No, it hasn't.

33
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,280
But why?

34
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,400
To be honest,

35
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,159
my parents didn't raise me with love when I was a child.

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,280
It made it hard for me to tell them what I wanted.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,680
So, I even gave up on my dream.

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,920
- You did? - Yes.

39
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,800
What was your dream?

40
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,560
It wasn't the wacko in the corner.

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
I wanted to become an acknowledged artist.

42
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,120
I see.

43
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,639
Try giving it another shot now.

44
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,879
It's too late.

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,730
But thanks to that past,

46
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,279
I am shamelessly...

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,199
dreaming of becoming Cinderella.

48
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,399
I will live a happy life, showered by the love I didn't receive.

49
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,800
That was why you dreamed of the impossible. What was it?

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,199
Oh, Prince Charming, was it?

51
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,730
How is that impossible?

52
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,959
It doesn't suit you.

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,560
You're looking down on me again, aren't you?

54
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,639
You're very strong.

55
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,050
I'm not strong.

56
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,198
I have nothing.

57
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,920
And yet, you're confident. That's amazing.

58
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,638
Is it because I'm like a bulldozer?

59
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,040
You know your place.

60
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,039
But I dream of an absurd love.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,519
No matter what others say, you follow your heart.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,839
I'm not that pretty, either.

63
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,639
You're crazy beautiful.

64
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,079
Are you drunk?

65
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,639
No, I'm sober.

66
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Why are you showering me with compliments?

67
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,600
Because you seem to not know much about yourself.

68
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,879
You're a cool person.

69
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,120
I know myself well, okay?

70
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,279
I'm not that cool.

71
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,240
But I think you are. Okay?

72
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,279
Seriously, what is wrong with you today?

73
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,920
Hey, listen.

74
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,879
Back then, you said there were lots you wanted to know about me.

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,959
What were those?

76
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,800
What do you want to know about me?

77
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,439
Everything.

78
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
Everything about you makes me curious.

79
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
From this point on is Shin Jae Rim's delusion.

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,759
I'll tell you...

81
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,120
every single thing about me.

82
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,920
What's this? Why are you blushing?

83
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,959
What is it? I want to know. Tell me.

84
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,720
- You have to tell me. Come on. - No.

85
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
We're here.

86
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,600
You can leave now.

87
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
I will after I see you go inside.

88
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,079
Gosh. You're making the taximeter go up.

89
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,519
Let it go up.

90
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,160
Stop it. Leave already.

91
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,519
Go inside first.

92
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,319
I'm really heading inside, okay?

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,399
Why aren't you leaving?

94
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,959
To see you three more times like this.

95
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
We'll see each other again tomorrow.

96
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,959
But that's still a long way ahead.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Come on. It'll be tomorrow...

98
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,079
after a good sleep.

99
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,000
So hurry home and go to bed.

100
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,399
All right. I'll make sure to sleep well.

101
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Goodnight.

102
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Bye.

103
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,960
Really, how stubborn of you.

104
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,450
I still need to see you one more time.

105
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,679
You should really leave.

106
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,279
Okay.

107
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,840
See you tomorrow.

108
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,450
Goodnight.

109
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,480
Goodnight.

110
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,999
Like earlier, start the straightener from your roots.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,209
Draw a big circle upwards,

112
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,090
and then twist it like this in the end.

113
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,919
You're crazy beautiful.

114
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,480
I could smell something burning, like a squid.

115
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,329
What are you doing?

116
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll show him what crazy beautiful is.

117
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,559
That will only make you into a grilled ugly squid.

118
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,210
But I would still look better than you, a giant octopus. No?

119
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,330
How about I turn you bald like an octopus?

120
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,558
What is wrong with you? Let me go!

121
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,089
- No, I won't. - The fight between an octopus...

122
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,119
- and a squid has begun. - I won't let go.

123
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,240
- I told you to let go! - And...

124
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,209
- Hey. Let go. - it's a losing move if you...

125
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,839
- grab your opponent by the hair... - Together, okay?

126
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,759
In 3, 2, 1.

127
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,679
- when they grab yours first. - Let go already!

128
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,240
It took great effort to do my hair!

129
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,919
What was that? Come here.

130
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,840
No. Wait.

131
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,679
It's right before I head to work.

132
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,039
Let's talk after I come home.

133
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,210
I'll get us some beer and squid on my way back. And peanuts, too.

134
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,000
Since you're already at it, why don't you...

135
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,120
curl them tightly?

136
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,240
No way.

137
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,878
Making it look effortlessly pretty.

138
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,519
That's what pros do.

139
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,120
Making it look effortlessly pretty.

140
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,330
Not bad.

141
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,639
Not cool.

142
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Bye.

143
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,080
Gosh.

144
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,279
What will I do if Jae Rim falls in love with me again?

145
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
It's okay now.

146
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,320
Follow your joy.

147
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,279
Really, love makes people crazy.

148
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,519
Good morning.

149
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,879
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

150
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,279
Take this! Bang, bang!

151
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,720
My gosh, how cool.

152
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,799
This is nothing.

153
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
Chairman Ko is so cool.

154
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,519
How is it Chairman Ko that's cool?

155
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,038
It's my quickness, gentleness,

156
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,639
and mightiness that is cool.

157
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,840
Then you'll be totally fine without Chairman Ko from now on, right?

158
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,159
Of course.

159
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,559
Then give it to me.

160
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
You can live without it, right?

161
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,200
Carrying it around and putting your guard up will only stress you out.

162
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,120
You're already strong,

163
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,080
quick, and smart.

164
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,639
In short, you're perfect.

165
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,960
You don't need Chairman Ko.

166
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
Give it to me.

167
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm giving it to you because you're the one asking.

168
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Take good care of it.

169
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,279
Really?

170
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,879
Gosh.

171
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,639
To even give me your favorite umbrella.

172
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,479
You're all grown up now, Cha Min.

173
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,399
Great job.

174
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,720
Good boy.

175
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,159
Great.

176
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,440
She'll hug me again in return, right?

177
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,279
Cha Min.

178
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,559
What are all of those?

179
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,559
As you've said, I have feelings for Jae Rim.

180
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,679
I'm really happy that you've come...

181
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
to like someone.

182
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,559
You now have a precious weakness.

183
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
I will not let you go that easily.

184
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,039
Burying her alive or ostracizing her from society.

185
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,798
I'll make one of them happen for sure.

186
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,879
How will you do that?

187
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,720
I did a background check on her just in case.

188
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,159
It looked really easy to bring her family down.

189
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,639
Well, that should be the case for all poor families.

190
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,919
Ban Dan A.

191
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,558
I can do both. Bring her family down and bury them alive.

192
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,919
I'm more than capable of doing those.

193
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
I won't let you do as you want.

194
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,720
But you won't make it on time.

195
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,720
You can't lock her up her whole life.

196
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,919
What will you do if I get rid of her without a trace?

197
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,399
I was worried sick.

198
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,879
Give it your best to protect her, Cha Min.

199
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
Defending is...

200
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,919
much harder than attacking.

201
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Wait.

202
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,879
Just wait.

203
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
Tell me what I should do.

204
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,320
(Chungdam Heaven)

205
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,759
Are you okay?

206
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,039
- I'm sorry. - I'm all right. My apologies.

207
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,480
- I'm sorry. - You should've been careful.

208
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,519
Oh, no.

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
- Wipe it with this. - Okay.

210
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,679
This is bad. Really bad.

211
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,440
We need to hold another wedding at Chungdam Heaven.

212
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,000
Cancel all weekend reservations.

213
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,639
We're hosting another wedding?

214
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,720
Is it for one of our members?

215
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,799
It's for me.

216
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,879
I don't like anything time-consuming or complicated,

217
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,080
so we're holding a simple one here.

218
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,719
Well then.

219
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,890
I leave our wedding preparations to you, Jae Rim.

220
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,240
Let us talk in private.

221
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Stop being fooled by Moon Cha Min's tricks.

222
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,920
Don't get hurt by him, either.

223
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,839
(Deutsch Air)

224
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,839
Quit this place and leave with me.

225
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,319
"Leave?"

226
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,200
I was invited to a film festival in Berlin.

227
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,039
Expand your horizons while staying there for a month with me.

228
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,359
Start an official career.

229
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,720
Why are you going this far for me?

230
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,559
From now on,

231
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,410
I will simply do as my heart tells me to.

232
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,599
Come to me after settling things.

233
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,410
I'll be waiting.

234
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,279
(Deutsch Air)

235
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,410
Am I an idiot?

236
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,359
Moon Cha Min and I had nothing going on.

237
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,890
Honey?

238
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,890
Give us a minute.

239
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,079
I told you to do as planned and keep your promise.

240
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,000
That's why I'm here.

241
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,119
What more must I do?

242
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,038
The least you can do...

243
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,410
is choose which dress is better when I try one on.

244
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,170
Should I clap like a seal or what?

245
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,279
Do it.

246
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,559
If we're marrying because you broke your promise, give it your all!

247
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,519
Did you expect us to be lovey-dovey?

248
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,959
That will never happen, so wake up.

249
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,200
That's my line.

250
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,649
Had you not liked Shin Jae Rim, this wouldn't have happened.

251
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,759
Why did you do this to me?

252
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,650
So aren't I making all your wishes come true?

253
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,650
You think this is what I want?

254
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,279
Then focus solely on me.

255
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,559
Stop making that pitiful face. Put on a happy smile.

256
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,890
What can I do? I don't feel like smiling.

257
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,000
Is that so?

258
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,000
That means I can act out on a whim, too, right?

259
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,799
I hate it all!

260
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,839
What's with all of these?

261
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,480
Enough, or you'll hurt your feet.

262
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Dan A.

263
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Look.

264
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,890
You're pretty.

265
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,960
Behaving like that is a waste.

266
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,759
Moon Cha Min.

267
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,440
You jerk.

268
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,558
Give it to me if you can't do it.

269
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,440
No, I'll do it. The garlic is just very spicy, okay?

270
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:34,170
Jae Rim. It's my first time seeing you cry. You're bawling.

271
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,559
Let me do it.

272
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,799
It's okay. I'll do it.

273
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,039
I asked for non-spicy garlic because I was pregnant.

274
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,318
I came home early because I heard...

275
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,758
- we were making kimchi today. - Oh, my.

276
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,079
Hello.

277
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
Why did you bring that jerk home?

278
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:57,240
He's not a jerk. There was a misunderstanding.

279
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Is that so? I knew it. I totally did.

280
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,079
He looked like he was good-natured.

281
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,160
Were my punches not painful enough?

282
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,799
How dare you come here again?

283
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
I don't mind being beaten up again...

284
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,720
for my loving Soo Jin.

285
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:19,439
Isn't beating up your brother-in-law going too far?

286
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,679
How about I slap you with some kimchi this time?

287
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,039
- With what? - With kimchi.

288
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
I've always wanted to try it.

289
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
Stop.

290
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,118
Open up. Here goes the kimchi.

291
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,160
What?

292
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,680
How is it?

293
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,759
It's good. Do you have some rice?

294
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,200
No. You should work for what you've had, right?

295
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,279
Of course.

296
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,119
- Your mouth. - I'm okay.

297
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,519
All right. I'm going to Berlin.

298
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,359
I'll lead a happy life.

299
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,960
I hate people like Moon Cha Min, who blows hot and cold.

300
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:10,920
Marriage life would be miserable with such a guy.

301
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,200
What do I do, Dad?

302
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,359
It's like my feelings are much deeper than his.

303
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,319
But this isn't right, is it?

304
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,160
Help me out here.

305
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,720
Can I come in?

306
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,920
How about some suyuk?

307
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,240
I'm good.

308
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,118
It's the front limb of an antibiotic-free pork.

309
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,440
Cooked thoroughly with a steamer,

310
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,239
it's firm yet moist.

311
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,960
Imagine eating it with some kimchi wrapped around it.

312
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,720
Come out after ten minutes. They're playing cards outside.

313
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,759
It's amazing.

314
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,318
I thought things wouldn't work out between you and Soo Jin.

315
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,599
But you're here with us right now.

316
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,519
Same here. Today has deeply moved me.

317
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,039
What was your secret to success?

318
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
"Secret to success?"

319
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,960
Let's see.

320
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,119
She was my dream.

321
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:33,599
And for that dream, I poured my everything into it.

322
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,759
I got mugged.

323
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,839
I got beaten up.

324
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,279
I even got exploited.

325
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
You had it hard for that to be your secret to success.

326
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,240
But above all,

327
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,920
I knew...

328
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,960
I was...

329
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,319
a great person.

330
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,400
Or something like that.

331
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,279
Come out in ten minutes, okay?

332
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,519
Welcome home.

333
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,160
Because of the news of your marriage,

334
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,559
I no longer have an upset stomach.

335
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,759
What...

336
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,680
Dad. Are you happy that I'm getting married?

337
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
What is it?

338
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,799
Is marriage of convenience a big no for you?

339
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,839
I had serious feelings for Moon Cha Min.

340
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,640
But I don't like what we have right now.

341
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,358
Someone as beautiful as me...

342
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,079
shouldn't be treated like this her whole life.

343
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,119
I'm a princess, aren't I?

344
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,720
You're right. My sweetheart is the prettiest princess.

345
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,719
From now on,

346
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,880
I will date someone who loves me.

347
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,960
- Dad... - I'm right here.

348
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,798
It's okay.

349
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,200
(Chungdam Heaven)

350
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,400
(Chungdam Heaven)

351
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,599
Why are you all out here?

352
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,519
The door is locked.

353
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,400
Have you contacted Mr. Moon?

354
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,839
He's doing that right now.

355
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,598
We're on a sudden vacation.

356
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,680
Jeez.

357
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,960
Why would he tell us that only now?

358
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,160
He's really spoiled.

359
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,559
This place is an extendable pop-up store, isn't it?

360
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
For the time being, we're on paid leave.

361
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,920
He's even sending us a vacation bonus.

362
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
Mr. Moon must be busy preparing for the sudden wedding.

363
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,959
I guess he woke us up early so we'd enjoy...

364
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,400
our vacation to the fullest.

365
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,759
How considerate of him.

366
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,799
Now then, shall we go?

367
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,518
Go enjoy our vacation?

368
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,519
Let's go.

369
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,319
Jae Rim.

370
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,039
It feels strange, right?

371
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,680
Go meet him in person...

372
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,039
before it's too late.

373
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,359
Wait for me!

374
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,559
He's right.

375
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,279
Things can be turned back to how it was.

376
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,920
(Turn with Caution)

377
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,960
I went on about Cinderella being my dream every day.

378
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,039
So I can't tell...

379
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,720
Mr. Moon now that...

380
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,799
I have feelings for him,

381
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,480
right?

382
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,240
But I've come this far. Let's give it a shot.

383
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,960
I can do it.

384
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,680
Did you get hurt?

385
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,400
It's none of your business.

386
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,279
What brought you here?

387
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:55,839
Well...

388
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,000
A vacation out of the blue is absurd.

389
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,440
That's why I came out of the blue like this.

390
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,680
Do you feel unwell?

391
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,839
I'm simply tired. Skip to the end, and then leave.

392
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,839
Tell him not to get married to Dan A.

393
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,039
Stop him.

394
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,839
Tell him you like him. Stop him.

395
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,680
Your place is warm.

396
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,319
Gosh.

397
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,039
What is it that you want to say?

398
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,480
Until when's our vacation?

399
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,079
I don't know. Why do you ask?

400
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,640
Do Hong asked me...

401
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,160
to quit Chungdam Heaven and go to Berlin with him.

402
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,839
That's great. Go.

403
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,519
Are you serious?

404
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,920
Isn't this what we wanted?

405
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,359
In the end, Chungdam Heaven was your stepping stone.

406
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,960
Stop humoring a weirdo...

407
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,279
like me. Live a happy life.

408
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,079
What's stopping you?

409
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,559
So you were hoping things would work out between me and Do Hong...

410
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,480
and I would quit Chungdam Heaven?

411
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
That's right.

412
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,119
Was that why you were nice to me?

413
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes.

414
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,119
Say that Do Hong and I start dating.

415
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,519
Are you really fine with that?

416
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Yes, I am.

417
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,119
Unbelievable.

418
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,960
You were never serious, were you?

419
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,640
The materialistic one playing the fool with me was you.

420
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,200
I was always sincere when it came to you.

421
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,839
Watching...

422
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,480
how I treated you must've been fun.

423
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,519
"Fun?"

424
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,799
Do you really think so?

425
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,359
I don't care anymore.

426
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,039
Either way, you were never sincere to me.

427
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,960
And we will never meet again anyway.

428
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,680
Learn before you go.

429
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,640
Look straight into my eyes.

430
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,119
This is what a player is.

431
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,119
You wacko.

432
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,799
You can't treat me like this.

433
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,720
(Chungdam Heaven)

434
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,518
Tear the place down.

435
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,519
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

436
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,799
Destroy everything!

437
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:12,519
How dare you make my daughter cry?

438
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,039
Consider yourself lucky.

439
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,719
I would've done worse if Dan A hadn't liked you.

440
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:57,400
Didn't I tell you not to look for love?

441
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,360
Why shouldn't I?

442
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,000
Mom loved us.

443
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,999
And you were happy back then, no?

444
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,159
Did you meet your mom?

445
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,559
Is that why you've lost it?

446
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't get fooled.

447
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,289
That's enough, Dad.

448
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,360
I can't live on like this.

449
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,679
Is that so?

450
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,119
Then, let's cut ties.

451
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,399
Close Chungdam Heaven.

452
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Go to her without a penny. I wonder if she'll still love you.

453
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,000
You'll end up getting thrown away.

454
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,960
No one in this world loves you now.

455
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,159
Not a single person.

456
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,559
I'm sorry, Jae Rim.

457
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,039
I don't despise you.

458
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,360
I'll live despising myself.

459
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,559
Please...

460
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,239
be happy.

461
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,960
Because of my stupid dream,

462
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,329
I couldn't be honest with him.

463
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,559
Nor did he treat me with sincerity.

464
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:19,769
I must be someone who can't be loved.

465
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:46,960
Ms. Shin Jae Rim?

466
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,679
Are you home, Ms. Shin?

467
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,360
Are you Ms. Shin Jae Rim?

468
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,769
- Yes. - Here.

469
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,239
Thank you.

470
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:25,960
(To: Shin Jae Rim, 1-23, Gangbuk 3-gil, Seoul)

471
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:50,119
It's freezing cold.

472
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,199
Hurry up with the packing.

473
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:54,119
I am, okay?

474
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,960
I leave it to you.

475
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,360
I was being earnest when I said you were no Cinderella.

476
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,679
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

477
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
A warrior suits you better than Cinderella.

478
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:54,440
A brave warrior who can go wherever she wants.

479
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,599
You must've known as a kid that...

480
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,920
you were much cooler and stronger than you thought.
