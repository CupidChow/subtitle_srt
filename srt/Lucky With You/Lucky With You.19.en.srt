I don't know if it's the right time to say this,

but I have to tell you.

105
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,759
You're indeed not Qian Qian's type.

106

So...

107
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,240
no matter who she chose, it would still be the same.

108

She won't choose you.

109

Is it the same?

It's not the same.

If they were really a good match, then I'd accept it.

But this man...

114

Right? They're not suitable.

115
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,600
He really doesn't suit her.

Have you seen him?

117
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,399
But I really regret seeing this person.

118

Who am I compared to this man?

119
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,639
I'm like a blade of grass.

120
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,360
Monkey, sometimes, I am even...

121
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,240
I am even embarrassed for myself.

122
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,799
You're killing the conversation here.

123
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,600
I told you to try your best, but you're so dispirited.

124
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,080
You have to pull yourself together at times like this.

125
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,120
You have to pull yourself together.

126
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,080
If you really can't swallow this,

127
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,440
after we finish this glass,

128
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,799
I'll take you to find that jerk.

129
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,600
Who is he to do this to my friend?

130
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,399
If you want to do what's best for me,

131
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,080
let's not find...

132
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,120
this jerk.

133
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Hai Xing, you've said so much,

134
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,399
but who exactly is this person?

135
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,759
This...

136
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,960
Who is it?

137
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
He's a bad man.

138
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,879
He's terrible.

139
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:50,919
Look at you.

140
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,879
We've been talking for so long.

141
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,279
We've been friends for years.

142
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,080
You can't let something like this get you down, all right?

143
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,759
There are only two key points.

144
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,120
We must have guts...

145
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,519
and we can't be cowards.

146
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,639
You haven't learned any of those things.

147
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,879
You can't give up on yourself.

148
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,600
We have to work hard.

149
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Hard work can help you achieve anything.

150
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,960
It's not a serious matter.

151
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
It's just dating.

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,120
Monkey.

153
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,399
Do I not try my best?

154
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,879
No matter how hard I try,

155
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,960
I can't compare to that man at all.

156
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,440
Shi Yi, when I was an employee,

157
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,399
I worked from 5am to 8pm.

158
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,200
Now I own a restaurant. You know this.

159
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
I wake up early in the morning and sleep late at night.

160
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Even sleeping for five hours is a luxury.

161
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,320
I own a restaurant,

162
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,200
but I can't even bear to eat any of my own food.

163
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,559
What can I do?

164
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,759
You know, in my card,

165
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,240
there's only 100,000 yuan at most.

166
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
I've never had more than 100,000 yuan.

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,519
But then I thought,

168
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,759
it's okay.

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,039
It's our fate, right?

170
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,240
It's fine as long as I'm happy.

171
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Unfortunately,

172
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
I just had to fall in love...

173
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,440
with a woman I'll never be good enough for.

174
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,600
Hou Jue. Ms. Shi Yi.

175
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,200
What's wrong with my boss?

176
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,480
Your boss...

177
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,559
This...

178
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,120
What happened to him?

179
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,240
Is he drunk?

180
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
- Be careful. - Take it slowly.

181
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
Be careful.

182
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,879
My goodness.

183
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,679
- Be careful. - Be careful.

184
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,840
I'm fine. I'm not drunk.

185
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,200
- Get up. - I'm not drunk.

186
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,559
Get up.

187
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,840
- All right. - I'm not drunk.

188
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,559
Hou Jue and Ms. Shi Yi, just leave him to me.

189
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,600
I'll take care of him.

190
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,399
Come on.

191
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,519
This won't do. Let's do it together.

192
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,919
- He's so heavy. - Come on.

193
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,080
Be careful.

194
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,480
You don't have enough strength.

195
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,759
You can't carry your boss.

196
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,799
No, after I came to the city,

197
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,120
I became spoiled.

198
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,440
I used to be really strong when I lived in the countryside.

199
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,879
I even carried a pig once.

200
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,120
What have you carried?

201
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,639
He's too heavy.

202
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,639
Take it slow.

203
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,120
Be careful.

204
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,600
All right.

205
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
All right.

206
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,399
I'm so tired.

207
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,679
He's so heavy.

208
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
What are you doing?

209
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm still here.

210
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,840
No, I want him to take off his clothes.

211
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
He can sleep more comfortably that way.

212
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Comfortable?

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
He wouldn't even know if you beat him up.

214
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,320
Comfort? Do you even see any reaction from him? Look.

215
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,799
That's true.

216
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,679
Come on, Hou Jue. Help me out.

217
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,080
Be careful.

218
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,440
My gosh.

219
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,399
Okay, thank you, Hou Jue.

220
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,960
Leaving him to you...

221
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,879
honestly has me quite worried.

222
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,440
Why are you worried?

223
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,799
My dad loves to drink too.

224
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,200
I have so much experience...

225
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
with taking care of alcoholics.

226
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm just worried that you're too experienced.

227
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,519
Take good care of him.

228
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,080
All right. I won't see you out.

229
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,600
Deal with him. We're leaving.

230
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,039
Be careful.

231
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,559
Just close the door. I'll lock it myself later.

232
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,039
Okay, bye.

233
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,039
You can't sleep like this.

234
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,279
That's right.

235
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,410
Okay. Cover yourself up.

236
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,599
What should I do?

237
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,599
I'll do anything you say.

238
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:32,839
But why can't I do anything right?

239
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:37,039
I just like you.

240
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,720
Why don't you like me?

241
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,650
It's good as long as you're doing well.

242
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,440
As long as you're fine.

243
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,519
I'm in love too.

244
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,240
A crush is a romance too.

245
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:09,240
A crush is love too.

246
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,920
Unrequited love is also love.

247
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,680
I've been calling you my boss all this time.

248
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,410
But you're someone who's the least like a boss...

249
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
in this world.

250
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,960
You are so nice...

251
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,650
to all of your employees.

252
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,279
After coming from the countryside,

253
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,359
you were the first person who was nice to me.

254
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,000
You provided me with food and a place to live.

255
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,680
You even taught me a lot of things I didn't know.

256
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,279
Seeing you like this...

257
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
makes me really sad.

258
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,240
There are so many pretty girls in this world.

259
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,650
Why do you have to like her?

260
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,480
Sometimes, I wonder...

261
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,410
why it can't be me.

262
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,960
Maybe...

263
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,119
I'm not as chic as the girls in the city.

264
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,319
I'm not as pretty or good at dressing up.

265
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,559
But I really like you.

266
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,839
I really want...

267
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,559
to live a steady life with you.

268
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,519
Don't get lured away by those witches out there.

269
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,079
Mr. Hou.

270
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,559
What do you think of these three proposals?

271
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,279
I want to hear your opinion.

272
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,440
To be honest, I think Xiao Han's design is really good.

273
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,170
Moreover, compared to his last draft,

274
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,920
it's very different indeed.

275
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,680
But I think...

276
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,960
Hou Jue's advice played a crucial role in this.

277
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,799
He's the one who gave this design its soul.

278
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,480
You and I are on the same page.

279
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,200
If we don't force them,

280
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,170
they have no idea how much potential they have.

281
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,440
You sure have good ideas.

282
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,680
We'll use Bao Xiao Han's proposal for the bid.

283
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Okay.

284
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,839
I'll ask him to do the budget now.

285
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,839
Okay.

286
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,079
Come back.

287
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,559
Why don't we...

288
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,319
wait a bit longer?

289
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,000
Then how about...

290
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,960
we let Hou Jue take a look at it first?

291
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,359
What if he comes up with a better idea?

292
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,480
If he can make the foundation of this proposal more complete,

293
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,039
that's a good thing, of course.

294
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,240
Also, tell Hou Jue...

295
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,599
that if he comes up with any new ideas,

296
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,839
don't communicate with anyone else.

297
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,319
Tell him to come to me directly.

298
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,279
This proposal is already very valuable.

299
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,519
Keep this confidential.

300
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:06,519
Don't let anyone else in the company know.

301
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,039
Don't worry. I understand.

302
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,519
Okay.

303
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,000
This design is really good.

304
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,079
Let me take a good look.

305
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,039
Bao Xiao Han sure put all of his energy...

306
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,440
into this design this time.

307
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,079
Without the revision suggestions you gave him,

308
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:40,319
he wouldn't have been able to release all of that energy.

309
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,119
This draft wouldn't even exist.

310
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,799
I only gave him...

311
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,279
a really tiny piece of advice.

312
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,480
This wouldn't be possible without his creation.

313
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,759
You...

314
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,839
You're too modest.

315
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,799
That's why you improve faster than anyone else.

316
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,799
All right.

317
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,279
Your dad said...

318
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,279
to leave this proposal with you.

319
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,599
Don't show it to anyone.

320
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,960
It must be kept confidential.

321
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,839
Mr. Hou Junior.

322
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,039
Mr. Ma is here too.

323
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,319
What's the matter?

324
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,319
It's like this.

325
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,440
I think these two areas still need some tweaking.

326
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,160
- I want you to take a look at it. - Mr. Hou Junior,

327
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,480
do you keep the design drafts in this cabinet?

328
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,839
- Yes. - Okay.

329
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,400
I don't think we can change this material.

330
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,720
We definitely can't change it. It will cause a problem.

331
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,680

We can't neglect that.

Okay, I'll look into it more.

I didn't.

When I left,

452
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,719
didn't I put it in your cabinet?

453
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,360
I even left the key on your desk...

454
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,920
and reminded you to take it.

455
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,329
The design director wanted to see it just now.

456
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,039
When I opened the cabinet, it was gone.

457
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,199
It's gone?

458
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,289
Mr. Hou, here you are.

459
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,440
All the security footage for that period of time...

460
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,559
is here, right?

461
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,559
Yes.

462
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,360
I've made a copy of all the footage.

463
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,960
You may leave.

464
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,480
In that time period,

465
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,639
only Hai Xing and Bao Xiao Han were in there.

466
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,039
It can't be Hai Xing.

467
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,039
Hai Xing doesn't know anything about the company.

468
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,039
Besides, he doesn't even know I have a proposal.

469
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,809
Shi Yi, isn't that right?

470
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,000
Mr. Hou Junior is absolutely right.

471
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,920
Hai Xing has no motive to do this.

472
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,719
So if Hai Xing doesn't have a motive,

473
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,809
then all that's left is Bao Xiao Han.

474
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,840
It's even more impossible that it's Bao Xiao Han.

475
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,239
He's the one who came up with the proposal.

476
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,880
Why would he steal his own proposal?

477
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,769
Why do you think?

478
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,119
For money.

479
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,599
How did Bao Xiao Han end up in our company?

480
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:20,840
I don't have to repeat the story, do I?

481
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,440
Isn't that right?

482
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,639
He values fame and fortune very much.

483
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,840
Yes.

484
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:31,400
Ma Yong.

485
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Ask Bao Xiao Han to go to the meeting room.

486
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,239
I want to talk to him later.

487
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,599
Okay.

488
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Don't talk to him directly, Dad.

489
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,199
We'll just call the police.

490
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,960
The police will get to the bottom of everything.

491
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,000
We don't have to keep guessing.

492
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,719
The proposal has already been leaked.

493
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,480
It doesn't hold any value anymore.

494
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,840
The police's involvement won't do any good.

495
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,329
If the police investigate,

496
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:53,039
they will help you find the real culprit, right?

497
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,239
Secondly, they will help us find out...

498
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,960
which company the information was leaked to.

499
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:00,119
But right now, the fewer people who know, the better it is.

500
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,519
That's right. Go.

501
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,639
Why didn't you say anything?

502
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,000
Isn't this your expertise?

503
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,119
There's not enough evidence.

504
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,599
I can't make any conclusions yet.

505
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,199
When I said it wasn't Hai Xing just now,

506
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,329
I saw your expression.

507
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:30,719
What's the matter? Do you not believe it?

508
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,000
The truth hasn't come out yet.

509
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,400
Anything is possible.

510
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,599
Even if anything is possible,

511
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,809
it still can't be Hai Xing.

512
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:37,880
I'm telling you.

513
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,360
It can't be Hai Xing.

514
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,840
Excuse me.

515
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,360
I'd like to order.

516
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,719
Boss is back.

517
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:48,880
Put the bag down.

518
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,159
It's okay. Get back to work.

519
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
What would you like to eat?

520
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,809
We have fried rice, stir-fried noodles,

521
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,559
and our special Hai Xing Fried Rice.

522
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,769
Mr. Hou.

523
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:03,239
- Bao Xiao Han. - Are you looking for me?

524
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,559
Where did you go at noon?

525
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,599
What did you do?

526
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,920
Noon?

527
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,159
This afternoon.

528
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,480
Mr. Hou, why are you asking this?

529
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
A problem occurred in the company today.

530
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,039
Mr. Hou just wants to know more.

531
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,329
This afternoon,

532
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,440
I was with Mr. Hou Junior...

533
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,480
working on our design proposal.

534
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,159
Later, Mr. Hou Junior went for lunch.

535
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,769
I just finished up our work...

536
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,599
and then I went back to my desk to sleep.

537
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,599
Who can prove it?

538
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,960
Was anyone there?

539
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,159
Mr. Ma,

540
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,480
why do I need someone to prove that I was sleeping?

541
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,840
Xiao Han.

542
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:03,840
Mr. Hou values your talent a lot.

543
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,329
When we met back then,

544
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:08,880
he immediately approved...

545
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,719
and said we must offer a large sum to poach you.

546
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,329
He gave you such a great platform in the company...

547
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:15,769
to exhibit your talent.

548
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,769
This project is five times bigger than the Haicheng Project...

549
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:21,329
and he even lets you handle it.

550
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:22,809
Think about it.

551
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,880
A chance like this...

552
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,880
is what so many designers would kill for.

553
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,400
You should know better...

554
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,599
than to let Mr. Hou down.

555
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,960
Isn't that right?

556
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,289
Of course.

557
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,159
I'm so grateful.

558
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:40,960
Bao Xiao Han, you're a smart person.

559
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,289
There's no need to feign ignorance, all right?

560
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,809
Mr. Hou.

561
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,329
Now you're making me confused.

562
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,119
Why don't we just be frank with each other?

563
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,440
Okay, let's get to the point then.

564
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,360
Someone stole your proposal from Hou Jue's office.

565
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,119
It happened at noon today.

566
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,079
How is that possible?

567
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,960
What should we do then?

568
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,960
Mr. Hou. Mr. Ma.

569
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:19,039
You don't suspect me, do you?

570
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,519
I'm asking you now, aren't I?

571
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,360
There are only four people who know that your proposal...

572
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,960
was in Hou Jue's office.

573
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,000
Hou Jue, Wu Shi Yi, Ma Yong,

574
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,329
- and you. - I don't...

575
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,039
Yes, I do know.

576
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,920
But just because I know,

577
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,039
that doesn't mean I did it.

578
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,599
The three of them were never in the office alone.

579
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,719
The security camera footage shows...

580
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,440
that you were the only one in the office.

581
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,119
Moreover, you left by yourself.

582
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,809
How will you prove your innocence to us now?

583
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,360
I indeed stayed there for a while,

584
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,239
but I went back to rest shortly after.

585
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,289
And I didn't take it.

586
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,719
I took a nap afterward.

587
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,440
How do you prove you didn't do it?

588
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,289
Wait a minute.

589
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,159
The thing is...

590
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,639
why do I have to prove something I didn't even do?

591
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,400
Then why are you in such a panic?

592
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,769
No, that isn't the point.

593
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:20,400
Mr. Hou is more anxious than you about the proposal being leaked.

594
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,920
Xiao Han, calm down first.

595
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,809
This is just a routine investigation.

596
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,400
It's a necessary procedure, isn't that right?

597
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,480
You tell me.

598
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,599
No, this isn't a routine interrogation.

599
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,639
You're obviously suspecting me.
