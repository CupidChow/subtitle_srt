5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,719
Hello, Mr. Hou Junior.

6
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,680
I'm not Mr. Hou Junior now.

7
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm just an employee now.

8
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,090
What have you been up to?

9
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,199
Have you left the company?

10
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,370
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,479
If you're here to persuade me on behalf of Hou Zhi Rong,

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,400
I don't think that's necessary.

13
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,039
I don't have time for that.

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
Don't you know I've moved out?

15
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm working at Hedgehog Factory now.

16
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,199
It's quite nice here.

17
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,960
They're working...

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
on a proposal for the Ruiji Bid.

19
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,810
That's great. Congratulations.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,530
Hurry and work on it then.

21
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,159
Why are you still looking for me?

22
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm planning to go on a trip to clear my head now.

23
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,759
You can go on a trip anytime.

24
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,039
Are you not willing to help me?

25
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,719
Hurry up. I'm waiting for you.

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
I'll send you the address right away.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm hanging up. Bye.

28
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,599
But I'm already on the bus...

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,280
Hello?

30
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,120
Gosh. You're just like your dad.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,159
Doesn't it go like this?

32
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,039
All right. Everyone, get off.

33
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,039
Wake up.

34
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,680
Come out one by one.

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,759
Don't forget anything.

36
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,879
All right, let's go.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
We're all here.

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,599
Let's go to the front.

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Don't forget your belongings.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,319
All right. It's just up ahead.

41
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,159
- You startled me. - You're finally here.

42
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,560
I knew I could count on you.

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
I knew you'd come.

44
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,840
Is this Hedgehog Factory?

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,080
How is it? Not bad, right?

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,919
Now this is what you call a place...

47
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,280
where designers can create.

48
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,680
Sit here. I'll get you something to drink.

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Okay.

50
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,280
What would you like to drink?

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
Anything is fine.

52
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
By the way, Hou Jue,

53
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,050
you asked me to help you over the phone just now.

54
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,800
If I'm not mistaken,

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,050
do you mean...

56
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,439
you want me to be your leader?

57
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,759
You understood it...

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,730
exactly right.

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,199
It'll be a collaboration design.

60
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,279
You're the boss.

61
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
I'm the boss?

62
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,170
But you've already worked here for quite some time.

63
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,399
Why am I calling the shots?

64
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:45,050
I'm having a mental block.

65
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,439
I can't manage this alone, so I need your help.

66
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,519
I'm telling you.

67
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,759
Although Hedgehog Factory...

68
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,730
is a small company,

69
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,610
I believe we can help it...

70
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,079
at least get noticed...

71
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,439
and recognized in the market.

72
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,680
There are many big companies now.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
Take my dad's company for example.

74
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,730
Zhirong is indeed a very big company now,

75
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,120
but they have weaknesses.

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,730
They're under more pressure the bigger they get.

77
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,279
Moreover, their thinking is too entrenched.

78
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,639
They restrict their designers to only think inside the box.

79
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,920
They can't innovate,

80
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,199
make modifications, and create new things.

81
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,439
We're different.

82
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,759
Their era of entrenched thinking is already over.

83
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,240
We are new blood.

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,120
We represent the start of a new era.

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Isn't that right?

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
I agree.

87
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,399
Then stay.

88
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,680
Tell me.

89
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,120
What requests do you have for your salary? I'll ask for you.

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,040
Hou Jue.

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm extremely petty...

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,279
with people and companies that are also petty.

93
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,560
But you're completely different. You're not that kind of person.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
So we don't need to discuss this kind of stuff.

95
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,319
I already thought about it on my way here.

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,720
No matter how much you're getting,

97
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,360
I'll only take half of your salary.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,199
No more, no less.

99
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
You have to agree.

100
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,199
You have no other choice.

101
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,279
All right, let's not talk about this.

102
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,120
We're tight on time and we have an important mission.

103
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,439
Hurry up and show me your design proposal.

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
You're so reliable.

105
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,079
Ms. Shi Yi, what are you eating for dinner?

106
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,399
I don't know. I won't eat if I'm not hungry.

107
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,399
Ms. Shi Yi, we're going back to our room then.

108
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,040
- Okay, bye. - Bye, Ms. Shi Yi.

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,839
Shi Yi.

110
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,720
I'm glad I caught you.

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,319
My villa has been cleaned.

112
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,519
Your parents will be there soon.

113
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,639
Let's go together.

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,439
I already told them not to come.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,439
Are you stupid?

116
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,600
Do you not want them to get back together?

117
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,439
I do.

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,199
But they still need to have feelings for each other.

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,560
Otherwise, we can't force them to be together.

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,680
You need to create opportunities...

121
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
for feelings to develop.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,199
They're old now, so they're too embarrassed.

123
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,680
We'll just have to take action for them then.

124
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,879
Let's go, my bodyguard.

125
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,120
I'll get changed.

126
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
Wait for me downstairs.

127
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Go. Hurry up.

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
All right, everyone.

129
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Let me introduce you.

130
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,639
This is the famous designer,

131
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,759
Bao Xiao Han.

132
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,319
You guys know about Haicheng No. 8, right?

133
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,439
He designed it.

134
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,040
- Welcome. - Welcome.

135
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,160
This is Mr. Xiao.

136
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,360
- Hello, Mr. Xiao. - Just call me Zi Heng. Have a seat.

137
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,439
No, that's not appropriate.

138
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,160
Hurry up and sit. Don't be shy.

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,399
Here, have some water.

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,480
Chao Ren, you're here too.

141
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,519
I came here a long time ago. You came late.

142
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,199
Xiao Han, I've heard a lot about you.

143
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
I didn't expect you to be so much more handsome in person.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I saw your Haicheng No. 8 Project. It's awesome.

145
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,000
I've seen a lot of your designs.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,279
You're my idol.

147
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
You guys sound so fake.

148
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,959
Is he your fake idol?

149
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,959
In terms of looks, there's no way he's more handsome than me.

150
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,639
Gosh. It's obvious he goes for a decadent look, right?

151
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,079
All right.

152
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,600
Don't praise me too much.

153
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm afraid I'll be arrogant.

154
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,199
But...

155
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
thank you so much for acknowledging me.

156
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,639
I mean it.

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Hou Jue.

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,040
This feeling is so great.

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,199
It was worth coming here, right?

160
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,480
I told you that you won't regret it if you work with me.

161
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,519
Everyone knows him now, right?

162
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,759
I won't introduce the rest to you now.

163
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,439
You guys introduce yourselves at lunch later.

164
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,439
If I introduce too many people to you at once,

165
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,439
I'm afraid you won't be able to take it.

166
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,439
Okay.

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,439
Then on behalf of Hedgehog Factory,

168
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,279
I formally extend a warm welcome...

169
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,519
to Mr. Bao Xiao Han.

170
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,519
You've played this game before.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,450
Let's welcome Bao Xiao Han again.

172
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,919
- Welcome. - Thank you.

173
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,039
It's this way. Come.

174
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,120
The neighborhood is pretty nice, right?

175
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,519
It's pretty good.

176
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,159
- Is it in here? - Yes, it's this building.

177
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,360
- Shi Yi, you're here. - Dad.

178
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,399
What happened to your leg?

179
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,450
I sprained my ankle. It's nothing serious.

180
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,519
Lan Qi insisted on giving me a wheelchair.

181
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
How is it? Are you getting used to it?

182
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,330
Yes, it's easy to use.

183
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,450
In a few days,

184
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,279
I'll be able to play wheelchair basketball.

185
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,210
Did you drink again?

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
I drank too much.

187
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,639
Luckily, your mom brought me home.

188
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,399
Did my mom go to pick you up?

189
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,450
You just started a new job.

190
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,799
I didn't want to disturb you from your work,

191
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,090
so I didn't tell you.

192
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,559
You should've seen it yourself.

193
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,000
Your dad was completely wasted that night.

194
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,519
I even hurt my back.

195
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,120
I have no idea how you used to carry him back home.

196
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,559
I've already quit drinking.

197
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,879
I didn't even drink a drop of alcohol this afternoon.

198
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,000
You'd better quit.

199
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,279
Enough of that. Let's go inside.

200
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,399
Here, I'll push you.

201
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,210
- I'll do it. - Come on, Mr. Wu.

202
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,159
I don't really know how to push this.

203
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Shi Yi.

204
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,759
Lan Qi took us around here.

205
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,759
It's really nice here.

206
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,600
It would be great if we could have a big dog here.

207
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,919
You're even thinking of big dogs now. Gosh.

208
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,039
Here, Mr. Wu and Ms. Zhang.

209
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,399
I ordered food from the hotel,

210
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,720
so it's going to be a while.

211
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,000
- Let's eat some fruit first. - Okay. There's no rush.

212
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,210
Here, Mr. Wu.

213
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,360
Since we happen to have some time now,

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,879
why don't we battle it out in the backyard?

215
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,279
Chess? Let's go.

216
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,399
Let's go.

217
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,330
Let's go and play chess.

218
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,519
Let the girls have their girl talk.

219
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,759
Let's go.

220
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,919
Be careful.

221
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,450
Shi Yi.

222
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,450
Hurry up. Come here.

223
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,919
I'll bring it closer to you.

224
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,330
How is it?

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
What?

226
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,960
Is work going well?

227
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,679
Yes.

228
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,600
It's going a little too well.

229
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,759
What do you mean?

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,240
It's such a well-paid and relaxing job.

231
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,759
Lan Qi is also always taking care of me.

232
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
He has given me so much.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
I feel anxious.

234
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,120
What's there to be anxious about?

235
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,919
This is a reward you deserve.

236
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,480
Shi Yi.

237
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,559
Having someone sincerely treat you well...

238
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
is really hard to come by.

239
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,279
I know.

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,559
I know he's good to me.

241
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,879
He's also good to you.

242
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,519
But every time you accept his kindness,

243
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,320
I feel pressured.

244
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,679
I know what he's thinking.

245
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,639
I also know what you two are thinking.

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,080
But in terms of relationships,

247
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,480
you can't force it.

248
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,320
You can't use moral coercion either.

249
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,480
I have to decide for myself, right?

250
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,240
My baby.

251
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,639
Do you know how important a woman's marriage is?

252
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,360
It's like your second life.

253
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,919
So many girls...

254
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,080
regret not listening to their parents...

255
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,919
after suffering.

256
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,679
We love you and are responsible for you.

257
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,960
We don't want you to regret it later.

258
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,600
We can clearly tell that Lan Qi...

259
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,799
You and Lan Qi will have a bright future together.

260
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,799
Even if we have to tie you up,

261
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,960
we have to drag you onto this path, understand?

262
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,039
Mom.

263
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,799
Even if you tie us together,

264
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,240
that doesn't mean we'll be happy.

265
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,440
Take you and Dad for example.

266
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,600
Why did you get a divorce back then?

267
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,879
Why did you go back to work after retirement?

268
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,519
Isn't it because you followed your heart?

269
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,519
I also want to be like you...

270
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,200
and follow what my heart tells me to do.

271
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't want to rely on other people...

272
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,720
for my own happiness.

273
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
I got your genes.

274
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Here.

275
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,399
You could've gotten any of my other genes,

276
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,720
but you just had to get my stubbornness.

277
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
Silly girl.

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,519
Boss, you usually have to walk a lot in the restaurant.

279
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,960
Espadrilles won't scrape your feet.

280
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,000
It really is nice to have elders at home.

281
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,960
Having elders around...

282
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,679
really makes it feel like a home.

283
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Thank you, Shi Yi.

284
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,840
I have a goal to strive for now.

285
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,720
Don't do this again.

286
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,879
Stop doing this.

287
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,240
I know what you're thinking.

288
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,639
But from my experience,

289
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,919
nothing good in this world...

290
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,399
just happens naturally.

291
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,120
The chance is right there.

292
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,840
It will go to someone else if you don't fight for it.

293
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
Going step by step according to plan...

294
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
is not a bad thing.

295
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,960
Not everything can proceed...

296
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,519
step by step according to plan.

297
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,120
Like relationships, for example.

298
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,279
By the way,

299
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,200
I didn't want to ask Mr. Wu directly,

300
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,759
so I asked your mom.

301
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,960
There's still 860,000 yuan left in Mr. Wu's debt, right?

302
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,799
Why do you ask?

303
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,039
Although I'm not from a rich family,

304
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,519
I've been working in upper management these past two years.

305
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,840
My pay is pretty good.

306
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,600
Plus, I've been managing my finances,

307
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
so I have some savings.

308
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,799
I don't usually spend money.

309
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
The money is just a bunch of numbers if I don't use it.

310
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,279
I want it to be of use...

311
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,240
and pay off your dad's debt.

312
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,279
It'll be easier on you too.

313
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,879
Thank you.

314
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
But...

315
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,840
I can take care of my dad's matters myself.

316
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,799
It'll take at least two years if you rely on yourself.

317
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,320
It's good to get out as soon as possible.

318
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,679
Most importantly, you should help your dad...

319
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,879
stand tall again sooner.

320
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,240
Lan Qi.

321
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,080
You've already done enough for our family.

322
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,639
I really appreciate it.

323
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,639
But don't get involved with the debt.

324
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,440
I really can't afford to owe you such a big favor.

325
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,920
Besides,

326
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,240
it will make me feel bad.

327
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,200
I can't accept it.

328
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,890
You always say you owe me.

329
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,799
Actually, as long as you ask and as long as you're willing,

330
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,799
what's mine is yours.

331
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,039
Come in.

332
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,200
Do you want to go to the hospital?

333
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,000
It's okay. There's no need.

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,240
I'll just use this.

335
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,440
What's the matter?

336
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,200
I heard...

337
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,039
Great King Company hired a new design team,

338
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,680
called Hedgehog Factory.

339
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,799
It's a new company run by a group of young people.

340
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,519
Hedgehog Factory?

341
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,410
How can a new company compete with us?

342
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,079
Great King Company...

343
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,519
What the heck is Great King?

344
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,200
Does he think he's playing chess?

345
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,039
King and Queen?

346
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,079
All right. You can go now.

347
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,480
Look. We have one less competitor now.

348
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,200
That should boost your confidence.

349
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,720
So don't be too anxious.

350
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,799
Okay.

351
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Okay.

352
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,170
Hello, we're looking for Hou Zhi Rong.

353
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,319
Who are you?

354
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,599
We're from the municipal Economic Crime Investigation Division.

355
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,890
Mr. Hou's office is over there.

356
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,000
Okay, thank you.

357
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Hello, Mr. Ma.

358
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,519
Who are those two men looking for?

359
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,559
They're two police officers...

360
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,559
from the municipal Economic Crime Investigation Division.

361
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,650
They want to see Mr. Hou.

362
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,410
After we received the report,

363
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,799
we tracked the missing fund...

364
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,039
of 20 million yuan.

365
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,920
After the money was transferred from your account,

366
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,039
it went to an overseas account.

367
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,960
The transfer was done on an offshore server.

368
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,519
When it was transferred back,

369
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,799
a local ID was used.

370
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,319
Do you have a suspect?

371
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,890
We found the ID that used this account.

372
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,240
It was at an internet café.

373
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
Internet café?

374
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,319
We took some photos from the infrared camera.

375
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,890
The suspect knows very well how to avoid being tracked.

376
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,119
He put on a disguise.

377
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,480
Take a look and see if you know this person.

378
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,920
Is it someone close to you?

379
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,480
Hello, Mr. Ma.

380
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,920
Hello, Mr. Ma.

381
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,279
Do you know him?

382
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,680
- Hello, Mr. Ma. - Hello, Mr. Ma.

383
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,079
Mr. Ma, are you leaving?

384
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,000
Sir, I...

385
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,440
I suddenly remembered...

386
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,119
I have an important call to make.

387
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,519
Sit here for a while.

388
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,559
Okay, we'll wait for you here.

389
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
Okay.

390
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,000
Mr. Hou, please see if this project needs...

391
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,599
- Hello, Mr. Hou. - Check this again.

392
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,079
I didn't know last time. I took a look at it...

393
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Hello, Mr. Hou.

394
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Ma Yong!

395
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,759
(Hou Zhi Rong)

396
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,839
Hello, the number you have dialed...

397
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,119
He hung up on me.

398
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,039
You're 36 years old. It's your year of fate.

399
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Take it.

400
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,240
Things have changed.

401
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,680
Whenever something happens to me,

402
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,119
or when there's trouble,

403
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,799
it's always you who is by my side.

404
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,000
It's my duty.

405
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,559
Ma Yong.

406
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,759
Why did you do this?

407
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,759
I've encountered countless opponents in my life,

408
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,519
but I've never met someone...

409
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,839
who is so skillful, cunning,

410
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
and leaves no trace behind.

411
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,599
It looks like this hacker...

412
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,799
is not after Hou Jue this time.

413
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,880
It's me.

414
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,440
The funny thing is...

415
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
up until now,

416
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,759
I can't even think of one suspect.

417
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,880
Why?

418
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,200
I can't believe he betrayed me!

419
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,440
No means no.

420
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,480
There are no reasons for it.

421
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,279
No. My instinct says it's no good. Do you understand?

422
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,720
Hey, I worked so hard on this all night.

423
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,319
You're saying no just because of your instincts?

424
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,799
At least it's better than yours.

425
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,440
Yours is indeed creative.

426
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Then what?

427
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
It can't be achieved.

428
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,359
Won't you just be wasting everyone's efforts then?

429
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,400
Yours can definitely be achieved,

430
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
but is there a point?

431
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,839
Where's the fun in that?

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,359
We create every day.

433
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,440
We design every day.

434
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,680
What are we trying to design?

435
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,839
We want innovation and soul.

436
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,119
Even if yours is feasible, it's no fun.

437
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,920
We should at least make it first.

438
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,039
What's the point of making this?

439
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,319
This is rubbish.

440
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,920
So I think...

441
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,279
you two should do a crossover.

442
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,119
It would be invincible then, right?

443
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,079
This is what I'm thinking.

444
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,079
Hou Jue.

445
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,880
Put some imagination into Xiao Han's proposal.

446
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,359
Xiao Han,

447
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,160
you should make Hou Jue's proposal a little more realistic.

448
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,319
Perfect.

449
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,519
- Agreed. - That should work.

450
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,359
It's raining hard outside.

452
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,119
It took forever for the food to be delivered.

453
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,279
All right, get your food, everyone.

454
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,799
- That's all for today. - I'm starving.

455
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
As usual,

456
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,799
it's time to eat and play on your phones.

457
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,519
- If anyone... - Nobody is listening to you.

458
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
Let me tell you, Chao Ren.

459
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,799
You're paying everyone today.

460
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,920
Look at how many people there are in total.

461
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,640
Give them 200 each. You take care of it.

462
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,759
Give me one.

463
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,200
That Liu Tie Hao who kept causing you trouble...

464
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,599
will be released soon.

465
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,440
He's a hooligan...

466
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,119
who will do anything for money.

467
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,359
You must be careful.

468
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,359
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm sorry...

470
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,839
because I was the one...

471
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,119
who hired him to do everything that happened.

472
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,640
But I didn't mean to hurt you.

473
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,079
I just wanted to scare you and kick you out.

474
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,359
Please forgive me.

475
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Hello.

476
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,880
Ma Yong just sent me a message.

477
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,440
He said he did all those things.

478
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
He was also the one who hired Liu Tie Hao.

479
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

480
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,160
He didn't do anything to me.

481
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,039
He took 20 million yuan from the company.

482
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,319
I'm looking for him everywhere,

483
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,640
but I can't find him!

484
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,440
I must find him!

485
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,880
I'm coming over now. Don't go anywhere.

486
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,839
Go on.

487
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,319
We're here.

488
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,640
You guys eat.

489
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,119
Be careful.

490
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Mr. Xiao.

491
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,920
I think my proposal is indeed a bit conservative.

492
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
You have a bright future.

493
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,720
Ma Yong.

494
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,599
You're such a fool.

495
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,160
We've been friends for so many years.

496
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,559
You could've come to me if you ran into trouble.

497
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,519
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

498
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,200
I consider you my friend.

499
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,799
Are you stupid?

500
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,759
I have to find you.

501
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,400
I have to personally ask you why you did this.

502
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,240
Why did you do this to me?

503
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,920
Why?

504
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Officers.

505
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,039
Officers,

506
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,680
I recognize that person.

507
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,960
It was Ma Yong.

508
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,400
Ma Yong was the one who harmed my dad.

509
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
He ran off.

510
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,240
(Ma Yong, The vice president of the company)

511
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,319
(Hou Jue)

512
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,480
Hello, where are you now?

513
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm going to Zhirong Construction to see my dad.

514
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Dad.

515
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,079
Dad.

516
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,519
Are you okay?

517
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,519
He was with me for so many years.

518
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,240
I never imagined it would be him.

519
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,319
How is this possible?

520
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,640
That old fox. How ungrateful.

521
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,640
Not only did he transfer away my money,

522
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
but he also hired someone to threaten you.

523
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,319
I won't forgive him.

524
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,359
From the sound of his voice,

525
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,759
he seemed a bit weird just now.

526
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,319
He wouldn't do anything foolish, would he?

527
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,799
Do something foolish?

528
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,880
If he commits suicide, that's letting him have it too easy.

529
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,279
I have to make him tell me why he did this.

530
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,279
Why?

531
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,079
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

532
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,559
Mr. Hou.

533
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Tian Min unfortunately died in a landslide...

534
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
when she went to work as a volunteer teacher.

535
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,200
She's buried at Nanshan Cemetery.

536
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,839
I think that's where Ma Yong is right now.

537
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Is Tian Min involved in this?

538
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,240
They were in a romantic relationship.

539
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
They kept it a secret.

540
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,519
I'll go there right now.

541
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Tian Min.

542
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,079
I came to say goodbye.

543
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,480
I might not be able to visit you...

544
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,079
for a long time.

545
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,079
The police came to the office today.

546
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,559
But when I saw them,

547
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
I actually felt relieved.

548
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,640
You were right.

549
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
Vengeance doesn't make people happy.

550
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,079
Only love...

551
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,799
will allow you to live in peace.

552
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,480
(My love, Tian Min's grave)

553
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,359
Why did you do this?

554
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,400
Answer me. Why?

555
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,359
It's because my last name is not Hou.

556
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,640
Because in your eyes, I'll always be...

557
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,799
an outsider with other intentions.

558
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,039
I did it all by myself.

559
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,159
Hiring Liu Tie Hao to threaten Hou Jue,

560
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,159
hacking the Zhirong website, and taking 20 million from you...

561
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,289
I did it all alone.

562
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,599
You can do whatever you want to me. I'll accept it.

563
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,719
Ma Yong.

564
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,360
All these years,

565
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,559
have I not been good enough to you?

566
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,769
All these years, was I not loyal enough to you?

567
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,440
I joined Zhirong Construction as soon as I graduated from college.

568
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,000
I never changed my job.

569
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,400
I thought of this company as my home.

570
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,079
I regarded you as my older brother.

571
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,809
I ran errands for you and served as your assistant.

572
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,079
I respected you like you were my dad.

573
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,559
I worked 13 years for you.

574
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,679
I always remember you told me this many times.

575
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
"Ma Yong."

576
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,480
"One day, when I can't do this anymore,"

577
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,199
"I'll let you..."

578
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,559
"take over the company."

579
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,440
I was so touched back then.

580
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,679
I told myself...

581
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,079
that I must repay you.

582
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,000
That's why I always put your interests...

583
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,519
and the company's interests first.

584
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,769
I didn't care about money. I didn't want a high salary.

585
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,840
I watched you...

586
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,289
I watched you...

587
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,809
use everyone around you...

588
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:30,920
and break your promises to them,

589
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,559
but I still insisted on believing...

590
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,840
that your feelings and trust for me were different.

591
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,360
Until...

592
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,039
Mr. Hou,

593
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,329
until the day you were taken hostage by Xiao Wei,

594
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,239
I was outside your hospital room.

595
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,519
I personally heard you tell Hou Jue.

596
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,840
"This is a family business."

597
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:54,719
"Ma Yong is very smart."

598
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
"He works conscientiously and diligently."

599
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,920
"But he's an outsider."

600
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
"Outsiders may have other intentions."

601
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,039
"We have to be careful of them."

602
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,679
I worked hard for 13 years.

603
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,079
I worked hard for 13 years,

604
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,679
but all I got were these honest words from you.

605
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,679
Mr. Hou.

606
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,920
I'm just a lackey to you, aren't I?

607
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,039
I'm just an employee who's a total bargain.

608
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,960
You'll always be the boss, right?

609
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,519
That's why I hired Liu Tie Hao.

610
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,079
But I didn't plan on harming Hou Jue.

611
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,679
I just wanted to create a fake scenario...

612
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,679
to make him leave.

613
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,000
But I didn't expect you to find her.

614
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,809
She ruined all my plans.

615
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,159
Fine.

616
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,119
Since I can't get what I want,

617
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,519
then I have to use my own way...

618
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,809
to get all the value I lost over the past 13 years!

619
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,840
Do you know you almost made the company go bankrupt?

620
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
That wasn't my original intention.

621
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,159
Didn't I return every single penny in the end?

622
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,199
Then why did you transfer the money back?

623
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,480
(My love, Tian Min's grave)

624
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,079
Tian Min.

625
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,519
Tian Min died...

626
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,769
all because I wanted revenge on you.

627
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,809
Tian Min urged me not to do it, but I didn't listen.

628
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,769
But she still never left my side.

629
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,519
But I took advantage of her love.

630
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,719
I made her wait and bear with it.

631
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,329
Until one day, she couldn't take it anymore.

632
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:35,239
She ran away from home and was killed in an accident.

633
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:38,769
That's when I realized...

634
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,840
everything I was doing...

635
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,159
was meaningless.

636
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,809
It took me 13 years...

637
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,559
and I ended up becoming like you.

638
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,440
That's why I had to return the money to you.

639
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,920
I don't know whether you're smart or stupid.

640
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,360
When I found out that this was all your doing,

641
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,039
do you know how I felt?

642
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,400
Do you know how I felt?

643
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,440
Do you know how hopeless I felt?

644
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,559
Tian Min worked for me for many years.

645
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,039
I don't really remember her that well.

646
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,519
I only remember...

647
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:49,329
she was good-tempered, kind, and hardworking.

648
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,880
But I can't believe...

649
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,880
she passed away at such a young age.

650
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,880
I know the pain of losing one's family.

651
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,239
I've been there.

652
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,329
Only those who have experienced it...

653
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,559
know how it feels.

654
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,559
Tian Min traded her death...

655
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,679
for your life.

656
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,719
She wants the best for you.

657
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,239
I've heard your confession.

658
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:28,769
The repentance in your heart...

659
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,119
is the best punishment for yourself.

660
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,519
Today, I'll make a promise in front of Tian Min.

661
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,809
I, Hou Zhi Rong,

662
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,119
will not pursue...

663
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,440
all the things you've done.

664
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,480
From now on,

665
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,000
I just hope...

666
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,719
you can walk your own path properly.

667
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,000
This is where we part.

668
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:11,289
Thank you.

669
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:14,769
Mr. Hou.

670
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,920
(My love, Tian Min's grave)

671
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,289
He did so many bad things.

672
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,199
Are you forgiving him just like that?

673
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,809
Zhirong Construction is where it is today...

674
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:35,719
thanks to his contributions.

675
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,199
But I never knew what he was thinking...

676
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,159
nor did I want to know.
