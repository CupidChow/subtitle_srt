Her counterattack is working.

37

But she is still trailing by a narrow margin.

40

She continues to close in with punches from both sides.

You got the top mark in the practical assessment.

You're more skillful and experienced than them.

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,199
You're just lacking a bit in terms of physical fitness.

55
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,319
Look at them.

56
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,639
They're in their best shape.

57
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,160
No one can escape the natural order.

58

It's exactly because there's nothing I can do about it...

Step on it.

65
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,639
Don't be afraid of wasting gas, okay?

66
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,839
Dude, I'm already flooring the gas pedal.

67
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,839
I'm at the limit.

68
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,279
Think about the car I'm driving.

69
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,560
It's nothing compared to your car.

70
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Save it.

71
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,319
I told you to get a new car a long time ago,

72
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,319
yet you just won't do it.

73
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,680
You always drive this car to rescue people.

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,000
But if your car breaks down, you'll have to be rescued.

Attention to all rescue unit members.

76

Attention to all rescue unit members.

77

There are many corners on the mountain.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,680
The road conditions are complicated. Slow down.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
The situation at the scene of the accident is unknown.

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Safety first.

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Did you hear that, Monkey?

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
He told us to slow down.

Safety first.

84
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,279
Forget that. You're an exception. Speed it up.

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,079
I'm going to start when I get there. I won't wait for you.

86
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,680
No, it's too dangerous for you to do it alone.

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
You have to wait for me. Listen to me.

88
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Hey, Monkey.

89
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,720
Can you not make me worry?

90
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,000
Hello?

91
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,360

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Wait.

93
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,879
You're the one who's wrong, aren't you?

94
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,839
Where are you going? Follow me.

95
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,839
Hurry and come back.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
All right. I was wrong.

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm turning the car around right now.

98
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,720
Hurry up. Catch up.

99
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,319
You're so impatient. What's the rush?

100
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,319
Where are they? Is it here?

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
It's here. Gear up. Come on.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,040
All right, drop the rope.

Be careful.

105

It's okay. Keep going.

106

Don't be nervous. Lift open the glass.

112

Cover your face.

I'll save the lady first.

120

Slowly.

121
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,679
Don't be afraid.

122
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,840
The car is going to fall.

123
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,159
Don't be scared.

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Stay still.

125
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Don't move.

Don't move.

127

What about my husband?

128
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,240
Please take her and leave first.

129

Don't move.

130

132
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

133
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,039
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

134
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,240
Step back a little bit.

135
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,600
Okay, that's good. Stop.

136
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Take my hand.

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,210
Come out slowly. You must be slow.

138
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,399
Don't move now.

139
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,279
Monkey, listen to me.

140
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,919
It might not be able to take the weight of all three of you,

141
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,159
so see if there's any other way.

142
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,210
Don't worry about that.

143
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,360
Just pull when I tell you to later.

144
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,759
Stand up slowly. Do it slowly.

145
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,039
Come here.

146
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,159
Don't lift your arms.

147
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,759
Don't lift them.

148
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,879
Hold on to me as tight as you can.

149

Hai Xing!

151
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,210
Pull the rope.

We can wrap up early today.

163

Why did you act alone?

164
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,960
No. Hai Xing and I did it together.

165
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,279
It was the two of us.

166
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,200
- What should I say about you two? - Come on.

167
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,519
No. Based on my experience, the situation just now...

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,480
Who in our rescue unit doesn't have more experience than you?

170
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
All of us have been doing this longer than you.

171
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,480
- But I got too close this time. - Wait.

172
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,720
- You even drove fast, didn't you? - Hold on.

173
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
You just...

174
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,919
Thank you.

175
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,879
Thank you for saving us.

176
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,759
It's nothing. Get well soon.

177
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,879
Thank you.

178
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,240
You have to listen to instructions even if you want to save people.

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,360
There was no traffic.

180
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,559
I rushed over and saw them there. How could I not save them?

181
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,679
Saving lives comes first.

182
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,159
Right. Saving lives comes first.

183
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,919
But you have to make sure you're safe first.

184
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:20,919
Yes.

185
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,799
Then you won't cause unnecessary and uncontrollable risks...

186
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,000
for the rescue unit.

187
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,679
That's our principle.

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Copy that.

189
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,759
This is your birthday present.

190
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm just a little late.

191
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
I bought it for your book signing.

192
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,080
Do you call this being a little late?

193
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,639
You're too early.

194
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
You're 11 months too early.

195
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,600
This is my birthday present for next year.

196
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,440
Look at you. Your words are full of resentment.

197
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,960
Didn't we agree on this?

198
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,360
You'll support my work.

199
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,240
Do I not support your work?

200
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,240
We've known each other for almost three years.

201
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
But the days we've spent together...

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,279
can be counted on our fingers.

203
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,320
If this goes on, this isn't good for us at all.

204
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,799
I'm 34 this year.

205
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,519
My parents are rushing me to get married and have kids.

206
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,960
They're getting old after all.

207
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
They want to have grandchildren.

208
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,159
Your chivalrous acts are never-ending.

209
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,759
Why don't we just...

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,759
Do you want to get married? You...

211
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,679
You can just tell me directly instead of beating around the bush.

212
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
I'm ready anytime.

213
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,360
We can do it whenever you want.

214
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
And then?

215
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,120
And then? What do you mean?

216
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,879
Hello.

217
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,559
Is this Ms. Wu Shi Yi?

218
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,799
I am.

219
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,000
Is Wu Tian Yi your dad?

220
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,200
Yes, he's my dad.

221
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,720
He drank too much again. He's with me right now.

222
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,279
We're at the residents' committee.

223
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Come over here.

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Okay, I got it.

225
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,679
I'll be right there.

226
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,679
Thank you.

227
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,879
Da Peng.

228
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,960
Something came up with my dad.

229
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
I need to hurry over there and take a look.

230
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,559
So...

231
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,679
Why don't you eat first?

232
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,759
Eat more. I'll call you later.

233
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
I'll get going now.

234
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
My gosh, look at you.

235
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,720
Why is it so messy?

236
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,039
Don't drink that.

237
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,960
How can you drink tap water?

238
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,240
You'll get diarrhea.

239
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,759
I'll boil some water for you. Go in and get some rest.

240
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't you have work?

241
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,559
Look at the time. Why would I be at work?

242
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
Besides,

243
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,679
if I didn't come,

244
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
who would've paid for you?

245
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Look at you.

246
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,679
Why did you smash someone's signage?

247
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,399
There was a penalty on top of the compensation.

248
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
It was 12,000 yuan.

249
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,519
It was 12,000 yuan?

250
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,720
I should've just been detained.

251
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,360
I haven't paid off the old debts yet.

252
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,519
Now, you're adding on to it.

253
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,200
Dad, I don't expect you to help me.

254
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
Just be good and stay home, okay?

255
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,519
Don't cause any trouble for me.

256
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,159
I'm going to an event tomorrow.

257
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,519
- Singapore, - Hurry!

258
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,639
- Thailand, Japan, and Korea. - Quick!

259
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
- Start! - It'll take 28 days in total.

260
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,159
All my jewelry is sponsored by businesses.

261
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,720
They're very valuable.

262
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,159
They're incredibly valuable,

263
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
so I want to hire a female bodyguard.

264
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,440
She has to be the best one here.

265
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,039
Have you all taken on missions recently?

266
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,279
- Yang Hua. - Present.

267
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,399
Go to Mr. Zhao's office for your mission.

268
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,399
Yes.

269
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,080
She got a mission right after I mentioned it.

270
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,159
- Let's go. - Come on.

271
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,759
There are just these three men...

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,240
and these two women.

273
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,120
Go on tour with the singer...

274
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,360
to six cities.

275
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,320
It will take about 60 days in total.

276
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,799
Xiao Fang and Da Niu!

277
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,879
- Present. - Present.

278
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,360
Go to Mr. Zhao's office for your mission.

279
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
- Yes. - Yes.

280
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,960
My son is six years old.

281
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,159
He wants to visit his grandparents in Shanghai.

282
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,399
But I don't have time,

283
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,120
so I want to hire someone to go over there.

284
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,519
Can you recommend someone to me?

285
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,440
Zhou Ting Fang and Fei Fei!

286
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,960
- Present. - Present.

287
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
Go and accept your missions.

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
- Yes. - Yes.

289
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,639
Wu Shi Yi!

290
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,120
Go to Mr. Zhao's office for your mission!

291
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,170
Yes.

292
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,799
Shi Yi.

293
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,920
Go to Yashi Group at 10am to get an important document.

294
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,759
Okay, go.

295
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
And then...

296
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,079
drive to Zhirong Construction...

297
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,319
and get the CEO, Hou Zhi Rong, to sign and stamp it.

298
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,519
Send the signed and stamped document back to Yashi Group...

299
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,680
before 12pm.

300
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Is that all?

301
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,650
- Am I just delivering a document? - Yes.

302
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,650
Can't Tongcheng Delivery or Shansong do the same thing too?

303
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,039
The client said the document is very important.

304
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,650
If it's so important, why isn't he doing it himself?

305
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
You talk too much.

306
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,839
What kind of attitude is that?

307
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,759
All work is important.

308
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,079
It must all be taken seriously.

309
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,799
I got it.

310
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Stop right there.

311
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,960
Who do you think you're showing that sour face to?

312
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,119
It's for myself.

313
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,319
I'm not as good as others,

314
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,650
so I can't get more important tasks.

315
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,839
Can't I be mad at myself?

316
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,960
I'm telling you.

317
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,079
With your scores,

318
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,440
if you fall behind in the next quarterly assessment again,

319
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,599
you'll be eliminated.

320
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,839
When that happens,

321
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,410
you won't even be qualified to do deliveries.

322
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
Wait a minute.

323
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Which company are you from? Which floor are you going to?

324
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,519
I'm from Shansong.

325
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,920
I'm going to Zhirong Construction on the 28th floor.

326
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,240
Go on.

327
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,079
Wait!

328
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,480
Thank you.

329
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Xiao Wang.

330
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,119
Has Hou Jue come to work?

331
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,759
I don't think I saw him.

332
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,170
Okay, I got it.

333
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,559
Hello.

334
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,119
Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Hou.

335
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,890
I have an urgent special document here...

336
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,319
that he has to sign himself.

337
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,720
Mr. Hou, someone from Yashi Group is here.

338
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Let her in.

339
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,799
- Hello, Mr. Hou. - Hello.

340
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,599
I'm Wu Shi Yi from Eagle Security.

341
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,410
Yashi Group has asked me to deliver a document to you.

342
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I need your signature.

343
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,839
(Party B: Hou Zhi Rong)

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,240
(Zhirong Group Limited Co. stamp for contractual use)

345
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
It's done.

346
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Thank you.

347
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,079
Hello.

348
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,720
Is this Ms. Wang from Zhirong Construction?

349
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,720
I'm calling from the building's property management.

350
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,119
There's a document you need to get right away.

351
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,279
A legal person from your company needs to sign it.

352
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,519
Hello, Dad.

353
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,680
Do you know what time it is?

354
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,559
Why are you always late for work?

355
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,599
I'm on the phone.

356
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,839
Come back later.

357
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,359
I'm not late.

358
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,960
The traffic is really bad.

359
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,759
Don't worry. I'll be there soon. Don't be impatient.

360
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,079
- How are you... - It has been a while, Mr. Hou.

361
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Xiao Wei?

362
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,319
Hello?

363
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,319
Hello, Dad?

364
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,039
You won't answer my calls...

365
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,519
and you told the security not to let me up.

366
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
Surprise!

367
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,000
With just a simple deliveryman's outfit...

368
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,079
and an expired employee ID card,

369
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm standing right in front of you now.

370
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,799
Hello, Dad?

371
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,519
Who's there?

372
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Xiao Wei.

373
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,079
You're so surprised, aren't you?

374
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,079
Are you suffering now?

375
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,119
Xiao Wei.

376
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
Xiao Wei, can you put the knife down?

377
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,640
Let's talk nicely.

378
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,119
All right?

379
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,400
Talk nicely?

380
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,279
Without this knife, would you talk to me nicely?

381
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,960
Who's there? Dad!

382
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,920
Why didn't I answer your calls?

383
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,359
That's because I want you to calm down for a bit.

384
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,880
Once you calm down,

385
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,599
- you'll know why I did it. - Calm down?

386
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,039
I took my own design away from the company,

387
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,200
but you said it was an infringement.

388
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,480
Are you telling me to calm down?

389
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Xiao Wei.

390
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,599
But you designed it...

391
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,720
when you were working at the company.

392
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,240
I designed it by myself using my own time.

393
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,079
You made me promises.

394
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,240
Tell me. How many of them have you kept?

395
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,079
Yes.

396
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,759
Xiao Wei, listen to me.

397
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,599
- People... - It must've been a prank.

398
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,559
- How annoying. - A person...

399
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,400
- shouldn't be too narrow-minded. - Hello. You are...

400
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,559
I think the breadth of one's mind...

401
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,599
determines his success.

402
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,640
- Do you know that, Xiao Wei? - It has been three months.

403
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,000
No company is willing to hire me again.

404
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,279
- Call the police. - You've completely...

405
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:31,400
destroyed my future!

406
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,119
I don't know what you've done...

407
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,400
Xiao Wei, don't be rash.

408
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Xiao Wei.

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
- Close it! - I'll close it.

410
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,559
Close it!

411
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,559
- Close it! - I'll close it.

412
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,160
Mr. Ma!

413
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,039
There's trouble!

414
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,599
Don't panic. What's wrong?

415
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,079
Mr. Hou is being held hostage.

416
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,599
Xiao Wei, don't be rash. Listen to me.

417
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,519
Whatever it is you want,

418
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,559
- What's going on? - I'll agree to it...

419
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,839
as long as it's in my ability, okay?

420
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,880
Don't move. Xiao Wei, don't be rash.

421
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,799
- Hello, Xiao Wei. - Who is it?

422
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,119
I'm Ma Yong.

423
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
- Hang up. Hang up the phone! - No.

424
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,759
Please don't be rash.

425
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,079
You can discuss anything with me.

426
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,039
As long as you guarantee Mr. Hou's safety,

427
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,119
I'll agree to anything you want.

428
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,359
Mr. Ma.

429
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,720
You sure are like a son to Hou Zhi Rong.

430
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,079
Do you want me to discuss it with you?

431
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,279
First, transfer five million yuan to me right away.

432
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,079
Second, ask him to make a video apologizing to me.

433
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,559
Otherwise, I'll kill him now.

434
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,640
No, please don't.

435
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,160
Where will the company get all that cash right now?

436
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,200
Why don't you compromise?

437
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,319
I can transfer you two million right away.

438
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,079
Do you mean Mr. Hou's life is not even worth five million?

439
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,839
Okay, three million!

440
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,039
Ten million!

441
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Five million!

442
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,039
I'll give you all the cash in the company's books, okay?

443
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,759
Xiao Wei, there's one more thing.

444
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,359
Mr. Hou...

445
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
Mr. Hou's blood pressure is very high.

446
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,000
The doctor said he can't get worked up.

447
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Otherwise, his life will be in danger.

448
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,839
Mr. Hou!

449
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,640
Your heart...

450
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,160
- Is your heart acting up? - Cut the crap! Hurry up!

451
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,240
Xiao Wei.

452
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,559
I've been having a heart problem for years.

453
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,960
After that scare you gave me just now,

454
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,680
my heart is pounding.

455
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,400
- My heart is in pain, Xiao Wei. - Keep pretending.

456
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,640
- Stop pretending! - I'm not.

457
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,559
Do you know this is a robbery? This is a robbery!

458
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,079
Hurry and bring me the money!

459
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,599
What's wrong with your driving?

460
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,319
You hit me. What else do you want?

461
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
It's just a scratch.

462
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,160
It's just a scratch.

463
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,440
You have to compensate me even if it's just a scratch.

464
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Make some way!

465
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,079
This is...

466
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,279
You're in the wrong.

467
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,839
Can you get him some water?

468
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,559
I want water.

469
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,960
Behave yourself. Do you hear me?

470
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,079
This could really cause a problem to his heart.

471
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,160
It's just a glass of water.

472
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,519
She's just a secretary in our company.

473
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,640
She's just a girl.

474
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,559
Don't be afraid. Nothing will happen.

475
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,559
It's just a glass of water.

476
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,599
Fine. Only she can come in.

477
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
If I see anyone else,

478
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,599
I'll kill him right away.

479
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,839
I'm here!

480
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,759
Move out of the way!

481
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Who was that?

482
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Who was that?

483
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,880
I'm delivering water.

484
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Put the water there.

485
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,759
Put it there.

486
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,880
- Let me see. - Don't look.

487
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
I'm just looking.

488
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,319
I have to drink water.

489
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,599
Chairman Hou has to drink water.

490
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,240
Can I give it to him?

491
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Give him the water.

492
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Hurry up!

493
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,279
I...

494
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,799
I have to take my medicine too.

495
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,720
My heart hurts.

496
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,079
I have to take my medicine.

497
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:34,680
Chairman Hou has a heart disease.

498
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,680
He might die if he doesn't take his medicine.

499
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Medicine?

500
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Where's the medicine?

501
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,559
It's in that cabinet.

502
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,119
You go and get it.

503
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,559
Okay. I'll get it.

504
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
Don't play any tricks.

505
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,200
My heart hurts.

506
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,000
Stop acting!

507
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Get up!

508
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,279
Stop acting!

509
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,079
Come in!

510
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,200
Send the signed and stamped document back to Yashi Group...

511
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,400
before 12pm.

512
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,319
You were late on your first day of work.

513
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,839
We almost didn't get to see each other.

514
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,079
You were taken hostage.

515
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,960
What does that have to do with me being late?

516
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:39,880
Stop beating around the bush.

517
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,079
What do the company's rules and regulations mean to you?

518
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,880
That's enough. Stop talking.

519
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,559
Your blood pressure just went down.

520
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,400
If your blood pressure rises again,

521
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,480
I'll become a criminal again.

522
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,519
I'm telling you. You are a criminal.

523
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,359
If you keep this up,

524
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,440
you'll be a sinner to the Hou family.

525
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,480
What did I do that makes me a sinner?

526
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
You told me to give you some money...

527
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,880
so you can start your own business.

528
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,279
I gave it to you.

529
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,359
Then what happened?

530
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
You lost all the money.

531
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,759
That's no big deal.

532
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,000
What matters is whether it has made you understand...

533
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,279
what your capability is.

534
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,279
I'm telling you.

535
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,160
If something bad really happened to me today,

536
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,359
I don't know how many years it would take you...

537
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,720
to put Zhirong Construction out of business.

538
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,440
Let me be honest with you.

539
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,400
Sometimes, I really want to give the company to Ma Yong.

540
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,160
At least he works conscientiously and diligently and he's smart.

541
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,480
But he's an outsider.

542
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,279
Outsiders may have other intentions.

543
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,960
We have to be careful of them.

544
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,079
Do you understand?

545
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,519
Grandpa left the company to me...

546
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,079
and I'll pass the company on to you.

547
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,079
This is a family business.

548
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,319
Can you do it well?

549
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Look at the way you are right now.

550
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,039
You could infuriate me to death.

551
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,400
All right, old man.

552
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,559
I'll start working seriously tomorrow, okay?

553
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,920
I'll start working tomorrow.

554
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Don't be mad.

555
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,799
In your first lesson after you got hired,

556
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,680
what was the first thing I taught you?

557
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,839
Tell me.

558
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,799
Always put the client's interests first.

559
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,519
There can never be any reason to harm the client's interests.

560
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960
I can't hear you.

561
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,759
Always put the client's interests first.

562
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
There can never be any reason to harm the client's interests.

563
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,359
You failed to complete your mission within the stipulated time.

564
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,839
That's why the client complained about you.

565
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,519
What's the matter?

566
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,000
Now that you're experienced,

567
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,400
is your temper getting worse too?

568
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,279
Do you know the rules for punishment?

569
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,839
I won't be able to work for a month.

570
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,599
Go.

571
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,400
Reflect on yourself and write a report.

572
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,839
Yes.

573
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Where are you?

574
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,839
I'm not in a good mood right now.

575
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,200
I want to have a hot pot.

576
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,799
I'm in a meeting. I'm busy all day today.

577
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,640
I'm sure you'll get through this on your own.

578
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,319
- Hello, Mr. Hou Junior. - Hello.

579
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,920
- Hello, Mr. Hou Junior. - Hello.

580
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Good morning.

581
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
- Hello. - Mr. Hou Junior.

582
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
- Mr. Hou Junior. - Mr. Hou Junior.

583
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,000
What's with you? You're so excited.

584
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,319
- Thank you. - Mr. Hou Junior.

585
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,319
- How is Mr. Hou? - Mr. Hou Junior, is Mr. Hou fine?

586
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,079
Mr. Hou is fine. He has gone home.

587
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,000
Work hard!

588
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,440
This is the start of a happy day!

589
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,359
Mr. Hou Junior, what would you like to drink?

590
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,599
- Do you want coffee, tea, or... - Coffee.

591
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,640
Okay.

592
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Wait.

593
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Li Li.

594
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,960
Tell them to change my chair.

595
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,039
It's uncomfortable.

596
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,640
Mr. Hou Junior, it's like this.

597
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,000
The arrangement of all the office furniture...

598
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,640
is the same as per Mr. Hou's request.

599
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,119
I have no right to change it.

600
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,519
All right. Go and make me some coffee.

601
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,720
Yes.

602
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,559
Mr. Hou's request.

603
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,960
Mr. Hou's request.

604
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,640
Mr. Hou Junior is a director too.

605
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,920
- Isn't that right? - Hou Jue.

606
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,680
- Let's meet. - Am I right?

607
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Yue Yue, where are you?

608
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,239
I'm at Meilu Hotel on Qixian Road.

609
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,119
Okay.

610
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,840
Why aren't you here yet?

611
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,639
Room 0237 at Meilu Hotel on Qixian Road.

My googly cat,

613
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,199
you didn't get lost again, did you?

614
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,079
Come quickly, my love.

615
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,119
- What a coincidence. - Let me borrow your car.

616
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,719
What's the matter? You're in such a rush.

617
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,809
I don't know yet.

618
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,119
Drive slowly. Don't break the traffic rules.

619
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,769
When did you buy a car?

620
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,599
It's to help me get around.

621
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,599
Why did you ask to meet here?

622
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,119
Bai Quan lives nearby.

623
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Who?

624
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Here.

625
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,519
Whose is it?

626
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,329
Take a look.

627
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,559
"Huang Yue and Bai Quan's wedding..."

628
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
What does this mean?

629
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,159
All right. I just wanted to show you.

630
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,159
It's not for you.

631
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,039
From now on, stop sending me 800 messages on WeChat a day.

632
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,519
I'm a married woman now.

633
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,719
If you keep sending me messages like that,

634
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,159
I'll just have to block you.

635
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:10,000
But you just came home for a month.

636
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Why are you getting married?

637
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,239
Are you serious?

638
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
It doesn't matter.

639
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,769
Sweetie, learn from your mistakes.

640
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:17,769
Remember.

641
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:19,559
Some women are unreliable.

642
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:21,119
I'm leaving. Bye.

643
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,880
Wait. No. Unreliable?

644
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,289
What do you mean? Tell me clearly.

645
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,289
What are you saying?

646
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,840
Why are you getting married? What is the meaning of this?

647
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,639
What's there left to say?

648
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,079
Let's wish each other well.

649
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,079
Let's never meet again. Bye.

650
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,639
Did she dump me?

651
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,840
Did I just get dumped?

660
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,920
What are you doing?

661
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,400
They're just handing out illegal ads.

662
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,769
Excuse me.

663
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,159
Hello, miss.

664
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:27,809
I forgot my keycard. Please open the door for me.

665
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,360
Are you staying in this room?

666
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Yes.

667
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
Hold on.

668
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,159
Calling the reception.

669
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,719
Copy.

670
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,960
The guest in Room 0237 says she forgot her keycard.

671
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Is it her?

672
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,329
Who?

673
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,559
It really is just someone handing out illegal ads.

674
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,679
Tell the guest to report...

675
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,000
the registered guest's name and identity card number.

676
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Here you go.

677
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,960
- Press here. - I know.

678
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Zhu Da Peng.

679
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:01,840
440303198609060017.

680
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,159
Identity confirmed. You can open the door.

681
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,119
Didn't you two break up?

682
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,519
What is she doing?

683
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,719
She's uncultured.

684
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,719
- She... - I'll go and talk to her then.

685
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:23,360
She'll hit you.

686
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,599
Zhu Da Peng!

687
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,559
That's so unreliable.

688
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,920
She's so unreliable.

689
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:50,809
Don't move!

690
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,679
Stop right there!

691
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:00,440
Hey, what are you...

692
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,639
What's happening?

693
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,079
Zhu Da Peng!

694
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,400
Wait. Hey!

695
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,880
Hey! Stop right there!

696
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,960
Hey.

697
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,239
Shi Yi, you're mistaken! I...

698
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,880
I didn't cheat on you.

699
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
Shi Yi!

700
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,599
Let me explain.

701
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,239
I really didn't cheat on you.

702
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,519
Shi Yi.

703
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,719
I really didn't cheat on you.

704
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,159
Trust me.

705
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,559
Stop right there!
