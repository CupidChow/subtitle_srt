00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,359
(Episode 25)

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I think...

5
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,760
it's better to bring Xiao Han back.

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Firstly,

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,760
the design problem can be solved immediately.

8
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
It will work instantly.

9
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,599
Secondly,

10
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,879
it's to prevent him...

11
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,920
from getting headhunted by other companies.

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,359
That would be a bigger threat.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
What do you think?

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,400
That's the only thing we can do now.

15
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,639
I'll leave it to you.

16
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,810
You're dismissed.

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
Where are we going later?

18
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,439
- Where's your sister? - She said she was coming.

19
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,199
Qian Qian.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Qian Qian.

21
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Let's eat.

22
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,400
Hurry up. Come and eat.

23
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,280
Where are we going today?

24
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,120
Xiao Yan, what's wrong?

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,680
Why are your eyes swollen?

26
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,240
Were you crying?

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,159
Sit down.

28
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,719
Qian Qian.

29
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,319
What's wrong?

30
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,199
We have to move out today.

31
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,919
What's wrong?

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,759
I broke up with him.

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,199
We can't live here anymore.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,479
We have to go back to my place.

35
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,240
And...

36
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,360
I have to return the car as well.

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,759
It's okay, Xiao Yan.

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
You can return it.

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,680
That car makes your dad carsick.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,639
That's right. I've always hated sitting in it.

41
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,840
- It's okay. - It's fine.

42
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,879
I don't like this house either.

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
I need to take the stairs just to get a nail clipper.

44
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,159
I have to climb flights of stairs each day.

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,719
I thought my legs were going to fall off.

46
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,159
Mom.

47
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,120
Did he treat you badly?

48
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
Xiao Yan, did he?

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,960
If he really did,

50
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,639
just tell me.

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,479
I'll make sure he pays for it.

52
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,520
I'll beat him up.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,240
Uncle, it's not like what you think.

54
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,560
We don't have the same interests anymore,

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,879
so we can't stay together.

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
That's okay.

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,719
It can't be forced if they don't suit each other.

58
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
Xiao Yan will be fine without him.

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,199
Come on, let's eat.

60
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,319
Xiao Yan, it's all right.

61
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,050
These days,

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
we have been to wherever we needed to go.

63
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,519
I think it's time to go home.

64
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,120
He just got some money.

65
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,560
Now, he thinks he can put on airs like that?

66
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,170
Aunt, don't say that about him.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,240
That's enough. Listen to me.

68
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,519
Let's pack up.

69
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,050
We're going back today.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,199
Xiao Yan, look.

71
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,610
You have quit your job and given him back the house.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
If you don't want to stay here,

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,170
then come with us.

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,439
- Come home. - Come with us.

75
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,839
Yes, Qian Qian.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,519
We have caused you troubles these past few days.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,170
Don't worry, Qian Qian.

78
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,920
Your parents have plans for you.

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,319
Yes.

80
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,610
We're a family.

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
We got your back.

82
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
Dad.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mom.

84
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,839
Aunt, Uncle.

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
I really want to come with you,

86
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,399
but I can't.

87
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,560
I have a job here.

88
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,240
I have friends.

89
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,920
I can't just throw it all away for a man who doesn't suit me.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,839
I can't accept that.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
That's right, Xiao Yan.

92
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,439
I'm relieved to hear that.

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,319
Go to work now.

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
Yes, Xiao Yan.

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,680
The world will keep moving.

96
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,800
Eat and drink up.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Here, eat up.

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,399
We'll pack up and head back.

99
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,480
Eat up. Come on.

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,560
Let's eat first.

101
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,360
Xiao Yan, let's eat.

102
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,199
Come on.

103
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,319
Here.

104
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,759
- Hello. - Hello.

105
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,759
Please help me deliver these keys to Mr. Hou Zhi Rong.

106
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,959
I've parked the car in the underground garage.

107
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,680
Okay. How should I address you?

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,879
You don't have to say anything.

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,519
- Just give them to him. - Okay.

110
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,839
- Hello, Mr. Zhao. - Hi.

111
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,839
- Hello, Mr. Zhao. - Hello, Mr. Zhao.

112
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,279
What's going on?

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
I'm withdrawing my resignation.

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,959
It was a hasty decision.

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,959
I accept the withdrawal of your resignation.

116
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:24,319
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I believe...

118
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,240
you'll find someone...

119
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,279
who treats you right.

120
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,480
Your one month off...

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
remains unchanged.

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
Finish what you started.

123
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,800
Send your family home and come back to work.

124
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,279
Mr. Zhao, I don't need one month off.

125
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,959
My family has already left.

126
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,399
I would like to resume work.

127
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,079
This is the only place where I feel belonged.

128
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,439
This is the only place I can find my inner strengths.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Report.

130
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,639
I request to resume training.

131
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,160
In 30 minutes,

132
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,199
the team training will start.

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,600
How about it, Ms. Qian?

134
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Let's have a warm-up run.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
- Yes! - Let's go.

136
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,439
Mr. Zhao, I have one more request.

137
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,839
Can I stay in the dorm for a couple of days?

138
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll move out as soon as I find a place.

139
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
Hey, Ms. Qian.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,399
You already took advantage of the company.

141
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,560
Haven't you had enough?

142
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,480
- One. - Wait.

143
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,279
Wait up, Mr. Zhao!

144
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,759
Honey, where are you?

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,679
Why are you hiding from me?

146
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,960
Why did you block me?

147
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,799
Why aren't you replying to my emails?

148
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,639
You know that I love you.

149
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,000
Stop torturing me.

150
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,799
I'm so worried.

151
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,759
Without you,

152
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,639
what is the point of living?

(Sent)

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
Give the file to a white-haired old man.

You...

Why are you running, sir?

It's really you.

That's right. Address me with respect.

164

Where did you get this?

165
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,200
Did you have to tear it off so roughly?

166

I'm telling you.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,240
I disguised myself...

168
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,399
because I didn't want to embarrass you.

169

00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,320
Aren't you ashamed that you got busted by me?

171
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,879
All right. You're doing it for me, right?

172
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,240
You're assertive in such a lousy way.

173
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,559
Fine, I won't judge you.

174
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,720
Otherwise, I would be a pot calling the kettle black.

175
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,320
All right, cut to the chase.

176
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,639
You run so fast for a little brat.

177
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,159
That's good.

178
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,639
Let's find a place to eat and talk.

179
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,799
Hold on.

180
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,879
Although I'm hungry,

181
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,639
I don't want to eat with you.

182
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,399
We're different.

183
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,879
I'm a protector of justice.

184
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,720
You're a mole and a traitor.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
Boy.

186
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,519
You're betraying Mr. Hou Junior.

187
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,039
I'm betraying Mr. Hou Senior.

188
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,919
These two are the same thing, okay?

189
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,279
They're not the same.

190
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,480
I don't have anything against Hou Jue.

191
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm only going after that old womanizer.

192
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,639
Old womanizer?

193
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,120
I want to hear what kind of a womanizer he is.

194
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Seriously, tell me.

195
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,159
I can help you then.

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,399
Sir.

197
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,919
You're already helping me.

198
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,120
If you don't want to tell me, that's fine.

199
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
Let's go our separate ways then.

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Hold on.

201
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
I said you were already helping me.

202
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,360
It was just courtesy.

203
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,240
You still have to give me the remaining 200,000 dollars soon.

204
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,759
Don't worry. I'll pay you once I get paid.

205
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,960
Keep thinking about the money...

206
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,840
and you'll be reliable when it comes to work.

207
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Reliable?

208
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
You're a liar.

209
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Are you ready?

210
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,919
I'm ready.

211
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,879
- Let's go. - Let's go.

212
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,200
You won't take your bag with you?

213
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,879
- Yes, I'll take it. - I'll get it.

214
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,279
Let's go.

215
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,440
- Hello. - Hello.

216
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,919
How can I help you?

217
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,440
I would like to speak with Ms. Hu.

218
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,919
- Do you have an appointment? - No.

219
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,879
I'm sorry. Ms. Hu has a full schedule today.

220
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,799
Tell her Hou Jue wants to meet her.

221
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,799
We know each other.

222
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,679
Okay, please wait a moment.

223
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,840
It's quite a hassle.

224
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,559
- Hou Jue. - Ms. Hu.

225
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,320
- It's really you. - Yes.

226
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,799
I thought you just share the same name.

227
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,840
No.

228
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,279
By the way, this is my assistant, Wu Shi Yi.

229
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Hello, Ms. Hu.

230
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Hello. Have a seat.

231
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,360
The last time I saw you was before I went abroad.

232
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,320
You've become a big designer in just a few years.

233
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,039
No, I'm not a designer.

234
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,679
I've been working for my dad since I graduated.

235
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,360
I don't have any independent projects.

236
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,759
So I'm not a designer.

237
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,720
You're so modest.

238
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
You're even humbler than your dad.

239
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,279
How is he doing?

240
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
He's doing well.

241
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
There have been a few gatherings in the industry,

242
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,000
but I didn't have time to attend...

243
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,200
because I've been traveling for work.

244
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,519
There's something I'm not sure I should ask.

245
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,650
It's fine. What is it?

246
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,839
Your dad's company is one of the best in our industry.

247
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,440
It's so much bigger than my company.

248
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,960
The projects they acquire are top-notch as well.

249
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,799
Many designers can't get in even if they want to.

250
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,480
Why did you leave?

251
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,279
I...

252
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,410
I left because I want to go on an adventure on my own.

253
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,650
My dad's company is big.

254
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,039
It's comfortable to have your back against a big tree,

255
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,170
but you can't get any sunlight...

256
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,890
or go through rain and storm.

257
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,650
I want to experience more and let myself grow.

258
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,519
Not bad.

259
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,079
You have ambitions.

260
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,720
You deserve applause.

261
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Thank you, Ms. Hu.

262
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,680
Go ahead. Let me know if you need any help.

263
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,650
Ms. Hu, I've set up my own studio.

264
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,480
We're still working on it.

265
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,079
Here, these are...

266
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,650
some of my work.

267
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,920
There are also some assignments I did back in college.

268
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
It's all in here.

269
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Please take a look.

270
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,319
I'll leave them here.

271
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,410
Okay.

272
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,650
I'll take a closer look later.

273
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,119
I came to tell you...

274
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,119
that I left Zhirong Construction.

275
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,759
I'm independent and working on my own.

276
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,319
If you have any smaller bids later,

277
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,410
please count me in.

278
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,720
Just let me participate in the tender.

279
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't worry.

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,319
I'll take care of Hou Zhi Rong's son.

281
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
No, Ms. Hu.

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,650
I'll fight for it with my abilities.

283
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,680
Please give me a chance.

284
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,680
Are you upset to be called Hou Zhi Rong's son?

285
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,119
No.

286
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,240
Good. You're ambitious.

287
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,170
You get that from your dad too.

288
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,650
I'm surprised you thought of me when you started this business.

289
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,170
I'll make sure to keep that in mind.

290
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,680
Where is your company now?

291
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
How many employees do you have?

292
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,960
Right now,

293
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm renting a friend's house.

294
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,759
We're just getting started.

295
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,440
The scale is still small.

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,359
It's just the two of us for the time being.

297
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,759
Not bad.

298
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,039
Not bad.

299
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, I got it.

300
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,319
My company isn't that big.

301
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,680
We don't get many projects.

302
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,240
Don't limit yourself here.

303
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,170
You two should go out there to find more opportunities.

304
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,119
Sure, I came here...

305
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,519
because I wanted to visit you anyway.

306
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,200
I also have an appointment with Mr. Peng later.

307
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,440
That's a relief.

308
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,519
You should talk to Mr. Peng.

309
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
- Okay? - Okay.

310
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,920
Okay. I won't see you out.

311
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,000
Sure. Okay. Thank you for your time.

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
I'll get going then, Ms. Hu.

313
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,410
Okay.

314
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,799
Hou Zhi Rong here, Hou Zhi Rong there.

315
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,599
Can't she talk without saying that name?

316
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,079
She's acquainted with your dad.

317
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,039
So naturally, she would bring up his name.

318
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,119
When will I be free from my dad's grasp?

319
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,440
This is crazy.

320
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,240
Designers speak through their art.

321
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,680
Before you have any work,

322
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,039
you can only be your dad's work.

323
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,890
You do have a point.

324
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,480
Let's take a taxi today.

325
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Public transports are crowded.

326
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,799
What taxi?

327
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,920
The subway is right ahead.

328
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Let's go.

329
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Come in.

330
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Ms. Hu.

331
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,079
I know Mr. Ma Yong's secretary at Zhirong Construction.

332
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,200
I asked around.

333
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,000
She heard from Mr. Ma...

334
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,119
that Hou Zhi Rong thought Hou Jue was incompetent,

335
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,599
so he wouldn't hand over the company to him.

336
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,410
Hou Jue was furious and left.

337
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,650
She told me not to tell anyone.

338
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,839
Okay.

339
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Mr. Peng.

340
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,079
Has Hou Jue come to you?

341
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,410
As far as I know,

342
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,559
the situation is complicated.

343
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,480
Analyze it for me.

344
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,599
Mr. Peng, I'm downstairs.

345
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,319
You're in such a hurry?

346
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,119
We can meet next time. No problem.

347
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,319
All right.

348
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,279
He said he's going on a business trip.

349
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
What should we do?

350
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Since we're already here, why don't we go upstairs?

351
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Come on.

352
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,079
- Hello. - Hello.

353
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,400
I have an appointment with Mr. Peng.

354
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,799
My name is Hou Jue. Please check for me.

355
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,960
Okay, please come with me.

356
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,079
Come in.

357
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,160
Mr. Peng, Hou Jue is here.

358
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,119
Mr. Peng.

359
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,559
I'm glad you're still here.

360
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,279
Didn't I tell you to call me later?

361
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,039
Yes. I'm afraid that I may not be able to meet you later on.

362
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,119
I have a plan.

363
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,079
I want to show it to you as soon as I can.

364
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,880
You're just like your dad.

365
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,799
You like to push others into a corner.

366
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,000
My business trip is not the point.

367
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,799
The point is we'll talk later.

368
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,079
Don't you understand?

369
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,279
I understand.

370
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,480
I'm just afraid you may not have time later.

371
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,519
I want to show it to you as soon as possible.

372
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,920
What a knucklehead.

373
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,000
How about this?

374
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,279
I'll just be direct with you.

375
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,079
I'm not going anywhere.

376
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,559
I just don't want to see you.

377
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Hou Jue.

378
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,119
Your dad and I were once classmates,

379
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,079
so I'm advising you not to waste any more time.

380
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,440
All the companies you know won't hire you.

381
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,839
Also,

382
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,720
I want to keep my company's confidentiality.

383
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,079
Have I made myself clear?

384
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,319
Do you think throwing it away will solve the problem?

385
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,119
I don't believe that everyone is afraid of your dad.

386
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,440
How can he disrespect me just because he's afraid of my dad?

387
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,279
I've put my heart and soul into my work.

388
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,160
But because he's my dad,

389
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,319
they all treat it as trash before even looking at it.

390
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,960
What's so good about having a dad like him?

391
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,599
Is this true, Dad?

392
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,440
This is great.

393
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,000
Karma has finally come.

394
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,720
No, I'm just kidding.

395
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,920
Got it. Bye.

396
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
What's wrong?

397
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,359
What is it?

398
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,839
You're so happy.

399
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,799
I haven't felt this good in a long time.

400
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,359
Tell me. What happened?

401
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,920
Hou Jue has turned against his dad.

402
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,960
His dad kicked him out.

403
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,480
He's penniless.

404
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
He's looking for work everywhere.

405
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,359
But it's a shame. He keeps begging for a job.

406
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,759
No one wants to take him in at all.

407
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,480
- It's so satisfying to hear. - Of course.

408
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,240
Liking his own bodyguard shows how low he is.

409
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
It serves him right.

410
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,400
Girls, I have an idea.

411
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Tell me.

412
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,119
I want to see how he's doing.

413
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,799
Good idea.

414
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,599
Hearing your plan energizes me.

415
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,160
- Let's go. - Let's go. It's totally okay.

416
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,400
- Let's get more people. - Okay.

417
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,680
I'm going to watch him fall.

418
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
What is this?

419
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,240
Look at it. It's ugly.

420
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,680
Are you giving me shoddy work?

421
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,839
Boss.

422
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,640
You should've paid a car wrap store to do it.

423
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
I can't possibly do it right.

424
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,799
Sure, I can pay them.

425
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,559
I'll deduct it from your salary this month.

426
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,400
I'll do it, okay?

427
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,319
You're getting more wily now.

428
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,799
Did you learn it from Mr. Tian?

429
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,519
Make sure the plate can be seen.

430
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,519
Did Hai Xing get a new car?

431
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
(Shi Yi: Audio message)

432
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,759
It's second hand.

433
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,160
I think it's eighth hand.

434
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,759
Hai Xing loves the hassle of making his car flashy.

435
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,079
Look who's here.

436
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,960
I know. She texted me just now.

437
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,759
Give them a warm welcome.

438
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,680
Hello. Welcome.

439
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,599
A table for how many people?

440
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,599
Is Hou Jue here?

441
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,039
Over here!

442
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,319
What business do you beautiful ladies have with Hou Jue?

443
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,079
- Take me to him. - This is too shabby.

444
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,799
This way, please.

445
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,319
Be careful.

446
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,720
- What is this place? - Watch your step.

447
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,960
What a dump.

448
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,319
It's really low.

449
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,799
Slowly. Watch out.

450
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,039
Monkey.

451
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
- Come on. - Okay.

452
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,839
I wonder who this is.

453
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,839
Come and have a look.

454
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,680
- It has been a while. - Come in.

455
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Come in.

456
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,319
Here.

457
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,839
What's this smell?

458
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,039
- Why is it so musty? - It's...

459
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,359
It's musty.

460
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,359
- No. That's nonsense. - That's right.

461
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,720
Take a seat.

462
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
You sleep on this bed?

463
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,039
Isn't this too small for your height?

464
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,039
Can you even sleep in it?

465
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,440
I usually sleep with my arms folded.

466
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,839
My gosh.

467
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,920
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

468
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,559
You had a comfortable life.

469
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,480
Why are you experiencing life here?

470
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,039
Well, I'm enriching my life.

471
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,640
This is shabby.

472
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,039
Is it shabby?

473
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,319
I decorated it myself.

474
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,519
I think it's nice and cozy.

475
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,279
Fine. As long as you like it.

476
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,680
Be content.

477
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm not here to mess with you.

478
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,720
Let me introduce you to a few friends.

479
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,599
- Coco, Li Li. You've met them. - Hello.

480
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,839
And these three...

481
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:06,920
are the important people I want to introduce to you.

482
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,440
I want to give you connections.

483
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,759
They're the sons of the chairman of Feixiang Group.

484
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,440
Da Fei, Er Fei, San Fei.

485
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,559
- Hello. - Hello.

486
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Hello.

487
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,640
Are you touched that I came to help in your time of need?

488
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,079
I'm very touched that you came all the way here.

489
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,799
After all, we had such a close relationship.

490
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,799
Am I right?

491
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I forgot to tell you.

492
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,039
I almost became...

493
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,640
Young Master Hou's girlfriend.

494
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,759
- No way. - What?

495
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,559
- It can't be true. - If I hadn't figured it out then,

496
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,480
this would have been my bed.

497
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,599
I would have had to eat at the place downstairs every day.

498
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,599
Yes, luckily, Ms. Chen realized it just in time.

499
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,039
So she didn't fall into my hands.

500
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,920
Come on. It's Young Master Hou's mercy.

501
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,559
You have my gratitude.

502
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
A cockroach!

503
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,759
Where is it?

504
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,000
A cockroach!

505
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Let's go.

506
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,440
Quick! What is this horrible place?

507
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Let's go.

508
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Come on.

509
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,799
You won't hang out a bit longer?

510
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,680
- Have fun by yourself. - This place is sleazy.

511
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,039
This...

512
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,920
How could they break my bed?

513
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,119
What a disappointment.

514
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,200
I'm surprised.

515
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
About what?

516
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,799
You.

517
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,920
You have the courage to let her come.

518
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,119
I wanted to see how well I handle pressure.

519
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,319
What's the outcome?

520
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,799
I guess it didn't work out.

521
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,799
If I want to live the life they're living now,

522
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,519
even a lifetime of hard work won't be enough.

523
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,480
That was your life.

524
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,079
You can go back...

525
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,279
whenever you want.

526
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,839
I'm not going back.

527
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,359
I can't either.

528
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,079
I have walked...

529
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
into a blind spot.

530
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,039
I don't know what to do.

531
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,160
Do you know how I feel?

532
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,359
There are roads ahead and behind me,

533
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,519
but they don't lead me anywhere.

534
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
Are you at the office?

535
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Do me a favor.

536
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,359
Mr. Ma, Mr. Hou is not here.

537
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Where did he go?

538
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,519
He's on the roof.

539
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Mr. Hou.

540
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,319
Xiao Han replied.

541
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,839
He said he didn't want to come back.

542
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,039
He's going on a trip.

543
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,880
We waited for two days.

544
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,599
I didn't expect such an answer.

545
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,599
Yes.

546
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,599
Who does he think he is?

547
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,640
Call him again and tell him this.

548
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,039
If he comes back,

549
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,279
all his holiday trips from now on will be on the company.

550
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,839
But he's taking the flight today.

551
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:49,319
I don't care when he's taking the flight.

552
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,079
You have to bring him back.

553
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,400
We can't let him go.

554
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Mr. Hou.

555
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,119
I really can't do it.

557
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,720
He doesn't listen to me.

558
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,329
I see.

559
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,679
I'll call him.

560
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,400
He really thinks he can mess with us.

561
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:44,079
(Hou the Exploiter)

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,199
Hello, Mr. Hao.

563
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,920
Hey, Xiao Han.

564
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm Hou Zhi Rong.

565
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:59,039
Mr. Ma said...

566
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,329
he called you, didn't he?

567
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,360
About the incident last time,

568
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,329
I lost my temper and mistakenly blamed you.

569
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:11,559
Don't take it to heart.

570
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
I, Hou Zhi Rong, cordially apologize to you.

571
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,289
I sincerely hope that you can come back.

572
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,289
All right?

573
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,599
You're too kind, Mr. Hou.

574
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,559
You don't have to apologize.

575
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,719
I overreacted too back then.

576
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:31,000
I've been meaning to apologize to you.

577
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,360
Xiao Han.

578
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,599
You know that the Ruiji Hotel project...

579
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,329
is a once-in-a-lifetime world-class project to designers.

580
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:42,199
Many designers spend their whole lives...

581
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,639
not being able to get this project done.

582
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,519
It will mean a lot to you and the company.

583
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,639
Do you understand?

584
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,329
And as you may have heard,

585
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,920
Hou Jue has left the company.

586
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,119
He left for a completely different reason than yours.

587
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,039
I just let him go.

588
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,079
Even though he's my son,

589
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,400
I will never call him and convince him to come back.

590
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,440
But you're different.

591
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,769
You're an ambitious,

592
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:15,679
responsible, talented, and outstanding designer...

593
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,329
with great potential.

594
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:21,119
To me, you're like shining gold.

595
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,920
I, Hou Zhi Rong,

596
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,199
seldom give others a lot of credit.

597
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,960
But in my heart,

598
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,440
you're absolutely irreplaceable.

599
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,719
Do you understand, Xiao Han?

600
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,920
So I hope that you can end your work on a good note.

601
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,079
The company is under a lot of stress.

602
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,679
I'm stressed out too.

603
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,639
We all need you.

604
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,119
Mr. Hao.

605
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,329
Thank you for trusting me.

606
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,719
But...

607
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,840
Xiao Han, no more "buts".

608
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,920
Stop hesitating.

609
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,360
We have come this far.

610
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
We can't let it all go to waste.

611
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What do you think, Xiao Han?

612
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,559
Everyone in the company...

613
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,039
is hoping for you to come back.

614
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,880
I'll wait for you at the office.

615
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,239
That's all.

616
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,519
No, Mr. Hao. Hello?

617
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:11,719
Hello?

618
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,480
He'll definitely come back.

619
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Shi Yi.

620
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,329
Shi Yi.

621
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,679
Come on.

622
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,809
- Let's go. - What?

623
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,400
This is awesome.

624
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,679
A big motorcycle?

625
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,289
- Watch out. - What are you doing?

626
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,679
- You poured water on him. - I'm sorry.

627
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,809
I wish I could ride it.

628
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,679
Of course you can. Try it.

629
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,039
- Can I? - Here.

630
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:23,440
This is a bit too high.

631
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,289
I got you. Take it slow.

632
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,289
This feels different.

633
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:30,329
- It should be... - Hey!

634
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,599
What are you doing?

635
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,440
It's heavy. What if it crushes your legs?

636
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,239
Thank you.

637
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,000
It's a waste to give it to them.

638
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,289
It's also a waste to give it to you.

639
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,289
Me?

640
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,199
- Is it cool? - It's nice.

641
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,559
How do I look on this motorcycle?

642
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,559
It doesn't suit you.

643
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,809
Don't you want to go for a ride?

644
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,599
It's perfect.

645
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Here.

646
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Take it.

647
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:01,769
What do you mean?

648
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm taking you for a ride.

649
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,519
She's taking you for a ride.

650
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Get off.

651
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,769
Hop on.

652
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,199
Be good to the motorcycle.

653
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,880
Let's go in and eat.

654
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,199
- I'll pass. Be careful. - Don't just stand here.

655
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,920
Be careful. Hold her waist.

656
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,000
Ride it slowly. It's heavy.

657
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,960
Wear your helmet.

658
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,679
Alight in order.

659
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,920
Here we are.

660
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,329
Don't forget your belongings.

661
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,719
Don't leave it in the van.

662
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,599
Here.

I don't even want to break it.
