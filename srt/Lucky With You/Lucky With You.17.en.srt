4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,159
Boss!

5
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,920
It's like this.

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
The subdistrict office asked me to notify you.

7
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,640
They said that at 10am today,

8
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,079
you have to go...

9
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
to their fire drill or something.

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,960
The fire inside of me hasn't even been put out yet.

11
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,879
Then you should cut down on chili peppers, boss.

12
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,479
Why don't I go and buy you some anti-inflammatory pills?

13
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,639
What do you mean?

14
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,680
Didn't you say there's a fire inside of you?

15
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,599
Disappear.

16
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,159
You're so beautiful, Shi Yi.

17
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,199
You look great in this brand.

18
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,439
Isn't that right?

19
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,719
I've never dressed like this before.

20
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,479
It's a bit uncomfortable.

21
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,840
Do you like it?

22
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

23
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,280
You like it, right?

24
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,120
It looks good.

25
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,360
That's good.

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,879
Someone made this request.

27
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,599
He's so picky.

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,759
Wait a minute.

29
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,800
Don't look.

30
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,960
Here.

31
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
You give it to her.

32
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
You do it.

33
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,879
This is from Ai Mi.

34
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,520
What is it?

35
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,400
It's the Dior Prestige skin care collection.

36
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,839
It's perfect for a beautiful fairy like you.

37
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,120
This is so luxurious.

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
How can I...

39
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,730
Don't be shy.

40
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,399
It's not my money anyway.

41
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,560
Somebody is too embarrassed to give it to you himself,

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,050
so he asked me to buy it for him.

43
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,730
Shi Yi, everything you're wearing,

44
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,360
including the shoes, the purse, the outfit, and stuff...

45
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,000
are all his requests.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,680
That includes your hair and makeup too.

47
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,079
He gave me such a hard time.

48
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,360
If you weren't so pretty,

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
I wouldn't take this kind of client.

50
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,240
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

51
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,000
We're buddies. Don't mention it.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,120
- It's okay. You're welcome. - I still have to thank you.

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,730
You look so pretty.

54
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,319
Hurry up.

55
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,730
Baby.

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's not go in. Look.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,800
The bride and the groom have nothing to do with me.

58
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,610
But a certain someone has something to do with you.

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
Do you think I want to be here?

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,439
If you didn't sneakily try to hide the invitation at home,

61
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,120
I wouldn't have known that you...

62
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,120
If I hadn't found that invitation,

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,879
were you going to secretly come by yourself?

64
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,240
No way.

65
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,800
In that case, what are you afraid of?

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Come on.

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,279
Baby.

68
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,800
I remember now.

69
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,360
I have a draft I haven't finished.

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm going to go and finish it.

71
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,560
Zhu Da Peng.

72
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll make your wish come true today.

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,600
(Mr. Jiang Xi Yuan and Ms. Fan Sha)

74
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
Hello.

75
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,360
(Sign-in table)

76
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,160
Why did you prepare a cash gift too?

77
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,040
It's from your allowance.

78
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,639
Sure. We've talked about it for a long time.

79
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,639
- That's right. - Hello.

80
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,160
Are you guests of the groom or bride?

81
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,800
The bride.

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,959
Are you classmates or colleagues?

83
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,879
We're classmates.

84
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,120
So you're classmates.

85
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,920
I can't believe he still has the face to come here.

86
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,040
Exactly.

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,199
Am I overdressed?

88
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,319
Not at all.

89
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,560
This outfit is perfect.

90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,759
It's simple and classy.

91
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,399
It suits your elegance a lot.

92
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,399
This is how you should normally dress.

93
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,439
If you don't dress like this, it's a waste of your body and looks.

94
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,920
Just relax today.

95
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,439
Just be at ease.

96
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm telling you.

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,199
This is a wedding.

98
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,439
It's my good friend's wedding. Do you hear me?

99
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
If you hadn't reminded me,

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
I thought it was our wedding.

101
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Stop being silly.

102
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,199
Don't do anything out of line, understand?

103
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,839
Don't worry. When have I ever gone out of line?

104
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,199
I'm such a serious person.

105
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,279
Save it. I'm still worried.

106
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,800
Don't worry. Give them your cash gift.

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
It's your name.

108
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,279
Your name isn't here.

109
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,920
Why don't we go back?

110
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,480
Didn't you want to see her?

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Sit down.

112
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,879
You're Zhu...

113
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Zhu what?

114
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
Da Peng.

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
It has been a while.

116
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
You know,

117
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,720
if there aren't weddings...

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,879
or babies' one-month birthday celebrations,

119
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,759
we never get to see you.

120
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,160
There are funerals too.

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,480
We went to a funeral recently.

122
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,319
We saw all of his old classmates whom he hadn't met in a long time.

123
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,680
You're Deng Xiao Xi, right?

124
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,079
Let me introduce you. This is my wife.

125
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,519
We just registered our marriage.

126
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,839
Her name is Li Xue Mei.

127
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,199
Hello.

128
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,399
Shi Yi.

129
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,839
- Shi Yi is here. - Shi Yi is here.

130
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,079
Are they your friends?

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
- Shi Yi. - What happened?

132
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,680
We haven't seen you in a while.

133
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
You've gotten so pretty.

134
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,879
No, I'm still a plain Jane.

135
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,160
Even so, you're a beautiful Jane now.

136
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
- That's right. - Yes.

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,279
We all have discerning eyes.

138
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,519
She's so pretty.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
How is she pretty?

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,439
It's just makeup.

141
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,439
She's nothing compared to you.

142
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,450
Baby, why don't we go home?

143
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,210
Sit tight.

144
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,960
You can look at her up close later.

145
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,090
We're relieved that your life is getting better and better.

146
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,639
We're all especially happy for you.

147
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,639
- Yes. - That's right.

148
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,879
Those who know would know she's Shi Yi,

149
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,120
but those who don't, probably think you're a celebrity.

150
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,240
- That's right. - Exactly.

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,840
Don't exaggerate.

152
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,000
This new friend of yours is...

153
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,720
- This is... - I'm Hou Jue.

154
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,759
I'm Shi Yi's friend.

155
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,720
I've kept her company through countless days and nights.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,799
Handsome, you're awesome.

157
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,879
Shi Yi must have someone by her side today, right?

158
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,120
- Yes. - Of course.

159
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,600
Let's not stand here and chat. Why don't we all sit down?

160
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,759
- Yes. - Shi Yi, come.

161
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,919
- So... - Handsome.

162
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,679
You originally had a seat,

163
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,330
but somebody took it.

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,840
Why are you here?

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,399
Aren't you that guy?

166
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,879
Do you know him?

167
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,120
No.

168
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,450
It's fine. I'll go and find a chair.

169
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,240
Shi Yi, your boyfriend is such a gentleman.

170
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,480
No, he's a friend.

171
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,279
Come on, have a seat.

172
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,330
Here, let me slip in here.

173
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,960
Have you streaked...

174
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,450
- Shi Yi. - since the last time?

175
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,039
Lan Qi?

176
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,480
Why are you here too?

177
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,799
What a coincidence.

178
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,399
- Mr. Hou, it has been a while. - Mr. Lan.

179
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,519
Have you been keeping in touch with Sha Sha?

180
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,679
I didn't keep in touch with Sha Sha,

181
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,399
but I've worked with her husband.

182
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,759
When I got the invitation from her husband,

183
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,330
I thought it was someone with the same name.

184
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,879
I didn't expect her to really be our classmate.

185
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,000
- Is that so? - Yes.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,159
Yes.

187
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,279
What a coincidence. This is life.

188
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,000
Shi Yi.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Do you still remember Yan Zi from that class?

190
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,120
I'm talking about your deskmate whom you were best friends with.

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Let's go. She's looking for you.

192
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,960
- Let's take a picture together. - You...

193
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Mr. Lan, sit down.

194
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,240
Let's talk for a bit.

195
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
Come, sit. Hurry. Have a seat.

196
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,879
- Let's talk about work. - I'm going to the restroom.

197
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,039
Let's talk about life and...

198
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,399
You're not leaving, are you?

199
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,450
I won't.

200
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,879
How could I leave you behind?

201
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,240
- I'll be back. - So...

202
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,519
- It has been a while. - It has been a while.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,279
Did you miss me?

204
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,360
Let's take a photo.

205
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,120
These days...

206
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,240
What would you like to drink?

207
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,080
Well, Mr. Hou.

208
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
I have something to do. Please excuse me.

209
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
- I'll walk you out. - No, it's okay.

210
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,320
- I'll walk you out. - It's okay.

211
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,879
Three, two, one.

212
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,639
I'm going to the restroom.

213
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,440
I'll go and have a look. Let's go together.

214
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,759
Have a look?

215
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,120
What do you want to see?

216
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,399
I'll talk to you later. I'm going over there.

217
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,600
- Okay. - You guys talk.

218
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,720
I'll find you later. Bye.

219
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,840
- Bye. - Bye.

220
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Here's your phone.

221
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Thank you.

222
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,720
They're inside.

223
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,639
Are you not done yet?

224
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,240
You look pretty today.

225
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,919
Thank you.

226
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,399
I'll go inside first.

227
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Why are you here?

228
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,440
Let me tell you. We just threw a party in there.

229
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,759
The theme was Wu Shi Yi's ex-boyfriends.

230
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,879
They're all very handsome and talented.

231
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,840
- You're so annoying. - I'm telling you.

232
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,240
Dear guests,

233
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
in this blissful moment...

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
where a dream is coming true,

235
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,360
with big smiles...

236
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,240
and the sincerest wishes,

237
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,159
give your biggest applause once again...

238
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,799
to welcome the bride and groom into the hall of love together.

239
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,679
They're looking into each other's eyes.

240
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,720
- Stop playing. - Ms. Fan Sha.

241
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,080
Do you take Mr. Jiang Xi Yuan...

242
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,840
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

243
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,399
in sickness and in health,

244
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,200
for richer or poorer,

245
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,799
and be loyal to him...

246
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,080
until you leave this world?

247
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,039
Do you?

248
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,879
I do.

249
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,200
Ladies and gentlemen.

250
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,120
The parents of the bride and groom have already given...

251
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,320
their blessings to the newlyweds.

252
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
I see many of the guests here today...

253
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,840
are very touched.

254
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,679
Does anyone want to say something on stage?

255
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,639
Me.

256
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,840
Okay, come on. I see this gentleman.

257
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
Please come up and give your blessings.

258
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Don't mess around.

259
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,360
It's okay. I have something important to say.

260
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
- Don't worry. - What important thing?

261
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
- Don't worry. - I...

262
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,480
Don't worry.

263
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
Don't say any nonsense.

264
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,159
Hello, dear guests.

265
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,639
I'm Hou Jue.

266
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,080
I'm very glad...

267
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,799
that I could be at this wedding today.

268
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,720
I think this wedding...

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,519
is very romantic.

270
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,559
I also want to give my blessings...

271
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,919
to the newlyweds today.

272
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,279
I hope you two grow old together and have children soon.

273
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,399
There's no need to be surprised. You don't know me.

274
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,399
I don't know you either.

275
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,519
I'm a friend of your friend, Wu Shi Yi.

276
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,879
She brought me to the wedding today.

277
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm also very grateful to Wu Shi Yi...

278
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,000
for making me think that marriage...

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is actually...

280
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,360
a happy and romantic thing.

281
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,639
I would like to take this chance here today...

282
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,720
to say some words from my heart.

283
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,919
There's this girl I like.

284
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,720
The two of us have spent a lot of time together.

285
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,000
I slowly realized that I really like her.

286
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,320
Why do I think I like her?

287
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,200
I can't bear to see her suffer.

288
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,480
I can't bear to see anyone bully her.

289
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,399
I also can't help but bully her a bit myself.

290
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,440
I especially enjoy this feeling.

291
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,240
And then I realized...

292
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,600
I might be in love with her.

293
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,360
I want this feeling...

294
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,720
to continue.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,639
I want this person...

296
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,440
to be by my side for the rest of my life.

297
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,559
Today,

298
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,519
there are so many guests here.

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,799
In front of everyone,

300
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,679
I want to courageously pursue my love...

301
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,960
and express my feelings.

302
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,519
Can you all be my witnesses?

303
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,759
Wu Shi Yi.

304
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,639
Will you be my girlfriend?

305
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,759
- Say yes! - Say yes!

306
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,480
- Yes! - Yes!

307
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,679
Come down. Stop messing around.

308
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,720
- Yes! - Yes!

309
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,679
- Yes! - Hurry and go over there! Go.

310
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,360
This confession is too sudden.

311
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
Maybe Ms. Shi Yi didn't hear...

312
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,879
this gentleman's question clearly just now.

313
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,559
How about this, sir?

314
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,879
Please repeat it again.

315
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,919
Let us all hear it clearly, okay?

316
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,879
- Okay! - Okay!

317
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,080
- Go! - A lot of things I've done...

318
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,440
and said in the past...

319
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,080
make you think I'm really unreliable.

320
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
You think I'm always playing around.

321
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,440
But I am very serious...

322
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,720
about the words I just said.

323
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,399
I'm very serious.

324
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,440
I think this might be...

325
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,440
the most serious I've ever been in my life.

326
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,120
In the future,

327
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,840
in every highlight and low point of your life,

328
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,279
I hope I can be by your side.

329
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,759
I also hope...

330
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,799
you'll be in every little part of my future.

331
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:19,000
Actually, you're the one who made me truly feel...

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,039
emotion and love.

333
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,519
You've also taught me a lot.

334
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,680
I think meeting you was the luckiest thing ever.

335
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,359
I'm so lucky to have met you.

336
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,410
So will you be my girlfriend?

337
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,039
Say yes!

338
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:46,079
- Get together! - Get together!

339
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:53,119
- Get together! - Get together!

340
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,240
- Say yes! - Say yes!

341
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,079
Xue Mei.

342
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,480
May I?

343
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you.

344
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm sorry.

345
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,680
Let me take up a few minutes of your time.

346
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,279
I'm Li Xue Mei,

347
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,359
- Mr. Zhu Da Peng's wife. - Who is she?

348
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:23,319
Today, I'd like to borrow some joy from this couple...

349
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,279
to say a few words to my husband.

350
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,480
I'd also like all of you to be my witnesses.

351
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,319
Honey.

352
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,960
You're going to be a dad.

353
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,559
Why are you just staring at me?

354
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,799
We're having a baby.

355
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:52,440
Zhu Da Peng, listen carefully.

356
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:55,170
From now on,

357
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,650
even if the whole world turns against you,

358
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,759
the baby and I will always be by your side.

359
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,039
Forever.

360
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,759
What are you doing?

361
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,410
I love you.

362
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,200
You fool.

363
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,480
- Shi Yi, don't go. - Shi Yi.

364
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,890
- Shi Yi, don't go. - Shi Yi, don't go.

365
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm Wu Shi Yi.

366
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,119
Today, I'm especially happy...

367
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,890
to see my good friend get married.

368
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,039
You showed me that a woman...

369
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,559
can be successful...

370
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,720
and have a sweet romance at the same time.

371
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,119
I wish you all the best.

372
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,960
Thank you, darling.

373
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
You have to live happily.

374
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,559
As for the groom,

375
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,480
you must be good to her...

376
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,839
or I won't spare you.

377
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,319
Don't worry.

378
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,319
Also, right here,

379
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,680
I also want to give my best wishes to Mr. Zhu Da Peng...

380
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,079
and Ms. Li Xue Mei.

381
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,680
Since you've taken each other's hands, don't let go.

382
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,519
I hope you'll stay together forever.

383
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,359
I also hope your baby...

384
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,410
will be healthy and happy.

385
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,559
Thank you, Shi Yi.

386
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,920
Thank you, everyone.

387
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,410
- Great! - Great!

388
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,559
- Good! - Awesome!

389
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,920
Why do I always end up going on stage...

390
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,519
and telling stories at people's weddings?

391
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,440
I was halfway through my confession...

392
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,039
and that Xue Mei interrupted me.

393
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,079
Then she went up and made a love confession.

394
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,160
But honestly, you sure have...

395
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
an amazing character.

396
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,039
In a situation like this,

397
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,480
you even took the initiative to go on stage and help your ex.

398
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
You are so noble.

399
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,079
All right. Stop speaking so highly of me.

400
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,160
It was my good friend's wedding.

401
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,279
I didn't want things to be so awkward.

402
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,359
Yes. You're afraid other people will feel awkward.

403
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,440
So what do you think?

404
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,279
What do I think about what?

405
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,640
I don't have any thoughts.

406
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,720
I asked you to be my girlfriend.

407
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,200
What do you think about that?

408
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,240
Just forget it.

409
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,119
It's in the past now. Don't mention it again.

410
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,200
Let's bring it back to the present.

411
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,440
It can't be brought back.

412
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Why not?

413
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,039
- Is it because... - Because it's not possible for us.

414
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,519
Is it because of Lan Qi?

415
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,839
No, it has nothing to do with him.

416
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Then why?

417
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,359
You have to at least give me a reason for rejecting me.

418
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,160
You can't reject me for no reason.

419
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,200
There's a rule in our company...

420
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,279
that forbids us from dating clients.

421
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,319
It's a company rule,

422
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,319
but we can both keep quiet...

423
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,680
and not tell the company.

424
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,119
Does not telling the company mean it didn't happen?

425
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,720
It's still against the rules.

426
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,720
So if the company didn't have such a rule...

427
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,599
and this regulation,

428
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,960
would you say yes?

429
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,799
Is that right?

430
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,599
Did you really confess to her?

431
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,599
But she didn't agree.

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,240
Are you not going to change targets anymore?

433
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,599
I won't.

434
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,200
You brat. You finally get it. Gosh.

435
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,480
She keeps saying they're not allowed to date clients.

436
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,160
It's so annoying.

437
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,640
Then...

438
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,039
Maybe it was too sudden.

439
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,240
It's okay.

440
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,079
She'll know how you feel sooner or later.

441
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,720
That needs to happen soon.

442
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,759
Someone else is pursuing her too.

443
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,480
If she falls for someone else,

444
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,079
I won't have a chance.

445
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,319
Come on.

446
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,920
She can't say yes right away.

447
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm telling you.

448
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,279
Shi Yi is different from those girls you used to date.

449
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,559
She is indeed different.

450
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,000
She keeps telling me we're from different worlds...

451
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,640
and that we're impossible.

452
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,839
How are we from different worlds?

453
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,319
Why is it impossible?

454
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,680
It's possible.

455
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
- Of course it is. - Exactly.

456
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,519
You can't give up.

457
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,599
If you give up,

458
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,440
I'll hit you.

459
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,160
Here, hurry and drink some soup.

460
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,680
Drink up.

461
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,799
The way you looked today...

462
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,880
reminded me of the New Year's party from when you were a freshman.

463
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,839
I held your hand that night...

464
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,359
and confessed to you when the New Year bell rang.

465
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,279
That night...

466
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,519
was unforgettable.

467
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,599
That's it for my design proposal.

468
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:01,599
Thank you.

469
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,759
(Design by Bao Xiao Han)

470
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,400
Everyone here has seen the three proposals.

471
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,640
Let's talk about it.

472
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,079
Any ideas?

473
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,759
Ruiji International Hotel is a seven-star hotel.

474
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,599
It's Zhirong's Construction biggest bid...

475
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:39,519
in the last 10 years.

476
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,799
Just to be discreet,

477
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,799
we're holding a mini bid within the Design Department.

478
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,799
Bao Xiao Han, Ding Da Li, and Zhou He Hong...

479
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,640
have each brought their own proposals to the table.

480
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,880
You all just saw them.

481
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,039
I want to hear everyone's opinion...

482
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,880
on these three proposals.

483
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,640
You can give your suggestions too.

484
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,400
Speak your mind freely.

485
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,279
Don't feel restrained...

486
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,319
because I'm here.

487
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,680
All right?

488
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,640
Then I'll go first.

489
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,880
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,839
I think there are some problems...

491
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,880
with all three proposals.

492
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,039
But the most important thing is a lack of innovation.

493
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,240
With the current market situation,

494
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,519
it's important to be creative and original.

495
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,039
If it's not unique enough,

496
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,240
how will we come out on top...

497
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,359
and win the bid?

498
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:38,519
Innovation is the soul of a design.

499
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,160
If there is no soul, there is no life.

500
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,559
But there's a problem right now.

501
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,920
The bid target for this project is enormous.

502
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,960
Just focusing on innovation...

503
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,519
may not work either.

504
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,240
I still think...

505
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
a design should focus on the public...

506
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,920
rather than the designer.

507
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,799
That's the starting point,

508
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,279
so we must nail that down.

509
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,279
In terms of this aspect,

510
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,720
I don't think these three proposals are good enough.

511
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,680
Mr. Hou Junior, tell us what you think.

512
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,440
Do you want my opinion?

513
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,759
I think Bao Xiao Han's design is pretty good.

514
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,359
Although I'm not involved in this project,

515
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,519
I've read all the client's requests.

516
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,200
His design covers all of the client's requests.

517
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,680
They are also clearly conveyed.

518
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,279
The details are done especially well too.

519
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,039
Do you see how complete every detail is?

520
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,960
So I think he's great.

521
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,240
Bao Xiao Han has all my support.

522
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,279
Thank you.

523
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,279
Yes.

524
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,000
But I think the tone of the interior...

525
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,400
could be one shade warmer.

526
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,599
- It'll be better. - No problem.

527
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,000
I'll compare them again later.

528
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,920
Mr. Hou Junior said it so well.

529
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,559
You were direct and honest.

530
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,200
And it can be put into place.

531
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
Mr. Hou.

532
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,279
Why don't you conclude this with a few words?

533
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,240
Okay.

534
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,319
To end things,

535
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,519
let me tell you what I think.

536
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,680
All three designers have done a lot.

537
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,480
Thank you for your hard work.

538
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,599
The time given in a bid is never enough.

539
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,720
Although all three designers...

540
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,480
are very experienced,

541
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,799
being able to create something so thorough...

542
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,039
in such a short time...

543
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,920
is already amazing.

544
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,400
However, because there wasn't much time,

545
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
there are also many problems.

546
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,240
If I were to grade these designs out of a hundred,

547
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,920
I would give all three designers an F.

548
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,519
That's because I can't use your designs at all.

549
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,759
So take all your drafts back...

550
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,720
and make further adjustments and revisions.

551
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,160
Your next draft must illustrate its soul.

552
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,920
I want to see its soul.

553
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,880
You have five days.

554
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,480
You can do it in three days too.

555
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,960
The sooner, the better.

556
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,960
All right. That's all for today.

557
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,640
Hou Jue.

558
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,480
Come to my office.

559
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,480
Shi Yi, wait outside.

560
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,960
Close the door.

561
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,519
Hou Jue.

562
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,240
Were you purposely trying to ruin things for me today?

563
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,599
No.

564
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,039
I was speaking my mind.

565
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,880
I really think it's a good proposal.

566
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,319
Even if you really like it,

567
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,680
you could've told me afterwards.

568
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,240
Why did you have to openly go against me...

569
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,480
and the deputy managers at the meeting?

570
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,079
I was afraid they would misguide you.

571
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,920
I was afraid you couldn't tell it's good.

572
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,599
Do you think I'm blind?

573
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,079
Of course I know Bao Xiao Han's proposal could work.

574
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,119
But you can't compliment designers in public.

575
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,839
They'll get arrogant.

576
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,839
Dad.

577
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,960
It's so hard to be a designer.

578
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
They work day and night...

579
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,160
and put in a lot of effort.

580
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,680
I've seen a ton of designers.

581
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
They're all sensitive and sneaky.

582
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,640
If you give them just a little bit of acknowledgment,

583
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,680
they'll want fame and money.

584
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,799
Once you give it to them,

585
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,920
they'll run off when they are successful.

586
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,039
I've seen it happen enough times.

587
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,759
If you give them enough respect...

588
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
and honor,

589
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,039
then they won't leave.

590
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,640
I can't stand this nonsense.

591
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,880
Hou Jue, why are you so childish now?

592
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,880
They're your competition now,

593
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,079
especially that Bao Xiao Han.

594
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,839
Yet you acknowledged his talent at the meeting.

595
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,160
What about you then?

596
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,519
What about you?

597
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,480
If he's really better than me,

598
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,799
then good for him.

599
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,160
What can I do?

600
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,559
You're basically giving away the chance...

601
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,400
to make a name for yourself to someone else.

602
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,000
What do you mean?

603
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,400
Who do you think gets to decide...

604
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,480
whether a proposal is good or bad...

605
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,200
and whose proposal will be used for the bid?

606
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,759
It's your dad's call.

607
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,000
You've wasted the efforts I made for you.

608
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,680
Why don't I understand?

609
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,400
There hasn't been a big project like the Ruiji project...

610
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,319
in the last 10 years.

611
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,759
So many designers would kill for this.

612
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,680
How could I give away such a great opportunity...

613
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,440
to someone else so easily?

614
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,200
If I were to give this opportunity to you directly,

615
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,440
people would find it hard to swallow.

616
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,640
Do you understand?

617
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,599
Besides, the Haicheng No. 8 Project that you're working on...

618
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:51,599
isn't complete yet,

619
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,440
so they still haven't seen your accomplishment.

620
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
That's why I have no choice...

621
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,240
but to use an indirect method now.

622
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,559
I asked the three designers to come up with design proposals...

623
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,559
and then I'll lead everyone against them.

624
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,079
When the time comes, I'll recommend you.

625
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,440
After you get the proposal in your hands...

626
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,799
and revise it a little,

627
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,880
it'll all be yours, my silly son.

628
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,559
That means you want them to be my cannon fodder.

629
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,160
I'm not the only one against them.

630
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,400
All the executives opposed it.

631
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,880
They think there's a problem with their proposals.

632
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,440
Whether something has a soul or not is based...

633
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,799
on what other people say.

634
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,319
As the old saying goes, "Keep all benefits to yourself."

635
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,599
When you make a name for yourself one day,

636
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,160
it will be an honor for the Hou family.

637
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,720
When these designers become famous,

638
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,119
what will they do?

639
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,680
They'll just leave.

640
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,440
What can I do?

641
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
What am I after?

642
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,079
I don't know what you're after, Dad.

643
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,880
But I want to be genuine.

644
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,039
Genuine.

645
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,199
Was I wrong?

646
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,840
In what way?

647
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:16,000
Going against everyone else.

648
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,920
Do you really think it was a good idea?

649
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
Of course.

650
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,809
Then you weren't wrong.

651
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
Not only that,

652
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,599
but I also think you did very well.

653
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,639
You're brave enough to speak your mind.

654
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,519
I've never lacked that kind of courage.

655
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,119
So? Do you admire me a little bit now?

656
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,960
Be serious.

657
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,289
Let's get serious.

658
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,159
Thank you.

659
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,400
If you don't think I'm wrong,

660
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,809
then I'm not.

661
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,599
When I'm in power,

662
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,079
I'll fire all the people in the company...

663
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,920
who never speak the truth.

664
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,719
Thank you so much for your recognition.

665
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,960
Thank you so much.

666
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,920
Don't mention it. I was just telling the truth.

667
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,440
Let me give you some insider news.

668
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,599
Mr. Hou really likes your proposal.

669
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,960
Do your best.

670
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,769
Yes!

671
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
You can go.

672
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,329
By the way,

673
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,559
let's find time to return Ai Mi's outfit today.

674
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,840
Don't bother. It's yours now.

675
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,639
I thought we were borrowing it.

676
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,880
It's okay. You can keep it.

677
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,079
No, it's too expensive. I can't accept this.

678
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,360
It's not worth much.

679
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,400
Their shop has long-term agreements with many brands.

680
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,559
We can just treat her to a meal one day.

681
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:44,039
That's enough. Stop talking about this.

682
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:50,159
- Hello. - Monkey, I'm in a terrible mood.

683
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,920
What a coincidence. I'm upset too.

684
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,840
Okay, name a place. I'll come over.

685
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:00,239
Mr. Hou.

686
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:05,159
You have such good timing.

687
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,840
I just picked up my baby girl from the airport...

688
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,599
and then you called.

689
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:14,039
No one knows you better than me.

690
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,360
It's the chemistry we have built up over the years, right?

691
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,880
So? Did you pick your daughter up?

692
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,920
Yes.

693
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,519
You must feel reassured now.

694
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,559
Now that she's back, train her well.

695
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,559
You'll have an heir to your enormous company soon.

696
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,920
My daughter said...

697
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,880
that she came back this time...

698
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,559
with the excuse of looking after her dad...

699
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,639
so she can live off of me without guilt.

700
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,239
She doesn't want to be involved with any work.

701
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,769
She's just pouting at you.

702
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Come to think of it, I probably haven't seen Chen Chen...

703
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,239
for more than 10 years.

704
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,360
She still has so much personality.

705
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,239
Come and visit sometime.

706
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,519
I have something to tell you.

707
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,639
Okay.

708
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,199
Okay, I'm hanging up.

709
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,199
It's Mr. Hou.

710
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,329
Is it Hou Jue's dad?

711
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:16,159
The one who always talks with a fake laugh?

712
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,960
That's right.

713
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,960
That's him.

714
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,559
You have such a good memory.

715
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:29,679
Hey, my laugh is genuine, right?

716
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,159
Since you're my dad,

717
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,400
I'll consider it so.

718
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,289
Chen Chen.

719
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,079
Tell me.

720
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,769
I just wanted to pursue my dream girl.

721
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,119
Am I wrong?

722
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,639
Why doesn't she like me?

723
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,679
I'm like a toad trying to go after a princess.

724
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:01,920
First of all,

725
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,199
don't give up on yourself.

726
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,519
Stop thinking of yourself as a toad.

727
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,159
Even if you are a toad,

728
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:12,880
she's not a princess.

729
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,360
She's just a frog.

730
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,559
What are you saying?

731
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,920
How could you say that about her?

732
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,119
At most, you can call her a sparrow.

733
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,289
So there isn't that big of a gap between you two.

734
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,039
You're laughing.

735
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,039
Why are you laughing?

736
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:30,360
Toads and sparrows are not even the same species.

737
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,599
They aren't suitable.

738
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,329
We're not on the same page right now.

739
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:36,599
Just play with your phone for a bit.

740
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,639
Dolly.

741
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:38,769
Dolly.

742
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,639
Dolly.

743
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,000
Open it.

744
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:45,960
Open it.

745
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,679
You...

746
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,360
What's with her attitude?

747
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,719
Did you see that?

748
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
That's ridiculous.

749
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,329
I can't compete with anyone.

750
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:02,679
I'm doomed.

751
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Hai Xing.

752
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:11,159
Even though you can't compare to others...

753
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,400
in various aspects,

754
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,599
you have your sincerity.

755
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:20,480
You have to believe you can touch people with sincerity.

756
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,920
You can accomplish a lot of things.

757
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:26,239
Monkey, sincerity is worth nothing nowadays.

758
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,079
Is it the value of my beat-up scooter?

759
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:32,400
Can it match up to the other guy's van,

760
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,599
villa,

761
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,360
and five-star restaurant?

762
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:37,679
Are you serious?

763
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,239
Who is your opponent?

764
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,000
But if it were me,

765
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,239
I wouldn't choose you either.

766
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,639
But your sincerity will definitely get you somewhere.

767
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,840
Trust me.

768
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,440
There are a lot of girls these days...

769
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,809
who want a guy to sincerely treat them well.

770
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,480
Trust me, you can do it.

771
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,039
Do you believe your own words?

772
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,159
Do you not spend money?

773
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,519
Do you just use your sincerity?

774
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,360
What are you saying?

775
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,039
I win girls' hearts with my sincerity every time.

776
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,079
Even though I use money too,

777
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,559
they definitely chose to be with me...

778
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,719
because they were moved by my sincerity.

779
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,719
Give me a break.

780
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,289
Which one of those girls wasn't...

781
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,960
I don't want to hear you talk anymore.

782
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,559
Shi Yi, what do you think?

783
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,480
Sincerity can't just be shown with words.

784
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,719
You have to take action.

785
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,639
Do you see that?

786
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,840
Women only acknowledge things they can see.

787
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,199
Who cares about those insubstantial things?

788
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,809
Get out of here.

789
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,809
What should I do?

790
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,079
You guys tell me.

791
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,199
Should I give up now...

792
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,639
or keep going?

793
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,559
- Give up. - Keep going.

794
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:45,519
Don't interrupt.

795
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,769
Keep going. Trust me.

796
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,880
You guys should've just kept quiet. Now I'm more confused.

797
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,920
What's so confusing?

798
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,679
I think...

799
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,440
you need to be more rational.

800
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,769
Doing these useless things...

801
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,199
is just wasting your efforts.

802
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,239
How is it irrational?

803
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,599
How are we irrational?

804
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,679
Other than drinking a bit every day, how are we irrational?

805
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,639
Hai Xing, listen to me. Don't worry. Keep going.

806
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,920
Just save it.

807
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,159
That's easy for you to say.

808
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,559
Whatever you say is right when you have money.

809
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,000
Do you understand?

810
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,000
I trust Shi Yi.

811
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,679
Shi Yi, I'll listen to you.

812
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,960
What do you want to hear from me?

813
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,559
Talk some sense into me.

814
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,199
How do I do that?

815
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,559
I think love...

816
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,559
isn't something you'll get just because you work hard.
