I didn't come here at night before.

19
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,790
Don't you think the company<br> is a bit creepy

20
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,560
Since there's no light at night ?

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,370
It's safe because nobody's here.

22
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,880
Don't you feel creepy?

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,230
No. It's not creepy?

24
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,070
What?

25
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,520
Could you cooperate with me?<br>You had no response at all.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,570
How was that? Not bad, huh?

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,510
You freaked me out.

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,080
I couldn't sleep well each night.

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,690
Ma Yong, what if

32
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,800
we return the money

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,730
while no one's onto us yet?

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,680
Are you crazy? Xiaomin, why would you say that?

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,080
- I...<br>- You can't think like that.

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,390
I'm telling you, if you did that,

37
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,370
of the two of us, only I'd have committed a crime.

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,090
Do you want me to be a criminal? Do you want me to get caught?

39
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,510
No, I don't want that.

40
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,550
Guard this safely.

41
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,310
Let's go.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,080
Lock the door.

43
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,780
Do it for me. Only you can help me now, Xiaomin.

44
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,350
Okay?

45
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,390
Scared me to death!

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,730
Gross. It's no fun walking with you.

47
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,960
Hurry up.

48
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,010
- What is it? What is it, what is it?<br>- Shh.

49
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,750
A thief?

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,250
Let me check it out.

51
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,380
I can do it.

52
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:24,570
- Don't.<br>- Three, two, one.

53
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,490
Director Ma.

54
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,730
Hou..Hou Jue.

55
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,830
I was going to take the fire exit, but it looks like the lights are out. Elevator it is.

56
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,330
- Huh?<br>- Take the elevator. Elevator!

57
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,840
- Sorry, Director Ma.<br>- Sorry about that.<br>- Sorry again.

58
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,050
Hou Jue, listen to me. That was a moment of impulsivity!

59
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,050
- She and I aren't really in a relationship.<br>- It's fine!<br>- Please, please...

60
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,290
- Please don't tell anyone, do you hear?<br>- You don't have to explain.

61
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,530
If your dad finds out, I'll have to resign, Hou Jue!

62
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,420
- I am a man of my word. Trust me!<br>- Great, thank you, thank you.

63
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,120
Thank you, thank you. Thanks so much!

64
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,790
Xiaomin, are you okay?

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
What were you saying?

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,780
What was I saying? I can't remember now.

67
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,200
I was too worked up, I don't remember.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,520
But I explained it to him, you see.

69
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
No, I mean, how does he view our relationship?

70
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,190
We're in a serious relationship, but when he saw us,

71
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,460
we were sneaking around here. What...

72
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,540
What will this look like?

73
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,280
Well...I explained it! It was a misunderstanding.

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,590
Xiaomin, don't go.

75
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,130
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

76
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,530
Xiaomin, stop. Please...

77
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,500
Please, Xiaomin.

78
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,070
Xiaomin...

79
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,730
Wow, this guy Ma Yong has some prowess.

80
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,760
You usually can't tell.

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,330
This should be considered an office romance.

82
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,940
As a senior leader,

83
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,680
he knew and broke the rules.

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
Could I exploit this opportunity

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,460
and report it to Human Resources?

86
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,970
Would you say he was freaked out just now?

87
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,250
Alright, that's my construction proposal for Haicheng 8.

88
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,530
If you have any opinions, advice,

89
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,750
or differing thoughts when looking through, please speak up.

90
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,980
Now that Jr. President Hou's done...

91
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,690
let's hear from you all. Thoughts?

92
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,240
Jr. President Hou's proposal is pretty good,

93
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,070
and would implement all the most cutting edge materials.

94
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,000
The proposal's reasonable and within budget.

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,020
What else? Any actual opinions and advice?

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,380
Jr. President, your proposal's great on paper,

97
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,690
but these materials have never been used within the country.

98
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,480
We'd need to hire foreign architects to help out.

99
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,080
Our architects wouldn't be familiar with the materials, so we'd need foreign architects to help direct.

100
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,480
What does that mean?

101
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,170
If we needed to hire foreign architects for the project,

102
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,920
the budget and schedule would expand.

103
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,440
And it'd be harder for quality assurance.

104
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,540
Is there no other solution for these materials?

105
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,140
Normally, when we're using new materials,

106
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,190
we set aside training and turnaround time

107
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,370
within the project cycle. But we don't have that time for this project.

108
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,380
After talking in circles, you just mean that my plan isn't feasible after all.

109
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,920
Say something.

110
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,520
Tell me, what do you think of my proposal?

111
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,040
Jr. President, I've never used these materials either. I'm not familiar with them, so...

112
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,350
there's not much for me to say.

113
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,690
Fine then. Dismissed.

114
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,750
That Jr. President...

115
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,420
- Yeah.<br>- Can't he think on his feet...

116
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,480
<i>Architect monthly salary...¥20000.</i>

117
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,090
Xiaohan.

118
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,880
- Xiaohan?<br>- Eh?

119
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,490
What is it, Director Ma?

120
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,370
What video are you watching so intensely?

121
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,920
It's not a video.

122
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,420
Let's go. President Hou needs you.

123
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh, sure.

124
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,590
Come in.

125
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,120
You're looking for me, President Hou?

126
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,650
Xiao Han, come in, come in.

127
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,720
Sit down and we'll talk.

128
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,900
Uh...How did the Haicheng project go today?

129
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Have a seat.

130
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,260
Great.

131
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,930
Junior President Hou wants to liven it up

132
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,680
and has clear thinking.

133
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,410
I don't want to hear that from you.

134
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,600
What I need is for you to speak without reservations.

135
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,130
I am being honest. Really.

136
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,390
Do you know why I asked Hou Jue to take the lead on implementing this project?

137
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,290
Because Junior President Hou is outstanding. Your judgment is also very good.

138
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,580
Wrong.

139
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:48,020
My objective is to get him to understand the reality

140
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,890
that his capabilities aren't good enough.

141
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,220
So right now he's not at the level he should be at.

142
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,050
I want him to train him to achieve his objective.

143
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,490
Right now, this Haicheng project needs to get on the right track.

144
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,430
You need to be in charge of the details of implementation.

145
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,280
- Do you understand? <br> - President Hou, you've given a lot of thought to this.

146
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,200
Nothing else I can do. Just wait till you get married and have kids,

147
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,610
you'll know how bad a father I've been.

148
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,980
Yes, yes. Parents tend to go easy when it comes to their children.

149
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,880
Xiao Han, do a good job.

150
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,190
If you need anything, quickly let me know. The company will do its best to accommodate you.

151
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,920
Okay. I'll go get busy, President Hou.

152
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,380
Good.

153
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,940
Xiao Han, what's wrong?

154
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,050
Do you have something else to say?

155
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,250
Uh...President Hou, there is one other thing.

156
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,880
Go on.

157
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,600
It's about the matter of a Design Director that we talked about before.

158
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,320
Design Director? I thought it was something important.

159
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,840
Xiao Han, this title of Design Director is actually quite useless.

160
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,960
The actual ability to do the work is the important thing.

161
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,230
Doesn't everyone in the company see your capabilities.

162
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,850
Do you need me to convene a big meeting and announce that to everyone in the company

163
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,190
where I tell everyone that Bao Xiaohan is extremely important to our company?

164
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,820
That's obvious.

165
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,520
No, President Hou. You've misunderstood.

166
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,890
I know that you value me. And I am truly grateful.

167
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,620
But what I'm talking about is the salary.

168
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,740
In the beginning, didn't you make a promise to me?

169
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,890
After I came to the company and was successful in winning the bid,

170
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,220
you would promote me to Design Director,

171
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,050
then give me an annual salary of ¥500,000. Right?

172
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,180
Hasn't this been done?

173
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,520
No. In addition, the contract hasn't been signed.

174
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,310
- That's completely unreasonable. <br> - It hasn't been signed?

175
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,490
Ma Yong, exactly what's happened here?

176
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,610
At the beginning, when we got Xiaohan to come to this company,

177
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,090
what did we promise Xiaohan?

178
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,880
- Can you immediately resolve this for Xiaohan? <br> - Yes.

179
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,190
Everything he mentioned here...

180
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,570
how can such a big company like ours go back on our word?

181
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,100
Immediately contact the Human Resources Department and find out what's happened?

182
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,880
Human Resources, this is Ma Yong.

183
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,140
Why hasn't the contract with Bao Xiaohan been signed yet?

184
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,960
Exactly what are you doing in your department?

185
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,710
Wait. Immediately take care of this matter.

186
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,170
Otherwise, you don't need to report to work tomorrow.

187
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,960
I apologize, President Hou.

188
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,960
They said there are several people who asked for time off; and that there have been so many matters to handle lately.

189
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,580
So many matters to handle?

190
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,490
Is too much work a reason?

191
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,630
- No. <br> - Huh? <br> - No.

192
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,560
If this issue with Bao Xiaohan isn't resolved immediately,

193
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,390
all of the employees in Human Resources, including yourself...

194
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,710
the entire department can leave.

195
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,370
No, no, President Hou...That's too severe.

196
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,910
Xiaohan, I apologize to you. I'm sorry.

197
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,350
No, I apologize to you, Director Ma.

198
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,890
At this crucial time, we can't cause distractions for Xiaohan. Do you understand?

199
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,850
Xiaohan, I just got overexcited. My heart, you see...

200
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,750
You should calm down.

201
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,840
Xiaohan, let me tell you something.

202
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,670
You deserve what is yours.

203
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,720
- Not one less penny. <br> - I trust you.

204
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,670
The Haicheng project is at the stage of formal implementation.

205
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,730
What we need right now is for you to focus all of your energies

206
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,220
on completing this project successfully.

207
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,060
Hand over a first class final report.

208
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,580
I'm counting on you. Don't worry.

209
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,670
I'll personally take charge of resolving your issue.

210
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,730
- Okay, President Hou. <br> - Okay? <br> - I trust you.

211
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay, President Hou, you don't need to worry either. I will put all my efforts into this.

212
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,570
Do a good job, young man.

213
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,720
- Then, President Hou, Director Ma, I'll be going. - Okay.

214
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,370
President Hou, don't make them suffer too much.

215
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,700
I'll take care of him in a little while.

216
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,590
Go off with your work then.

217
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,110
What happened here, Ma Yong?

218
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,950
What are we going to do?

219
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,510
What else can we do? Next, we'll see how he implements this.

220
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,490
If he can do this, just give him the money.

221
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,920
We're giving him such a great opportunity;

222
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,730
and he can still ask for money. I should be the one asking him to pay me.

223
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,260
Hello, Mali. Where are you?

224
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,490
There's a huge rainstorm here.

225
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,000
In that rotten house, there's water flooding in everywhere.

226
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,380
Yes. All of my clothes, shoes, luggage is flooded.

227
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,660
<i> What can I do. I'm in a meeting here. I can't help you. </i>

228
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,400
No. The point is that I can't stay here right now.

229
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,410
Can I come stay with you for a few days?

230
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,930
<i> That won't work. It's not convenient. I told you I have guests. </i>

231
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,640
Wait. Then, what do I do? You were the one who told me to live below the bridge.

232
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,580
<i> - I can't talk. I'm really busy. </i> <br> - Wait. I gave him...

233
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,700
Hello. Hello.

234
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,740
What's this!

235
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,970
<i> - Hello, Fang Lu. </i> <br> - Brother Hou Jue.

236
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,090
- You...is it convenient for you to talk? <br> - <i>Go ahead, tell me what's up. </i>

237
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,190
I...there's been a huge rainstorm here.

238
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,850
My house is so old.

239
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,930
All my things have been flooded.

240
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,820
The point is

241
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,910
I...I can't live in my house right now.

242
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,610
I didn't know who to call to ask for help.

243
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,680
So I just called you.

244
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,840
<i> No problem. I'll get a room for you at a hotel. </i>

245
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,680
<i> Just stay in a hotel for a few days. </i>

246
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,200
That's too much trouble, isn't it?

247
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,420
<i> It's not trouble. What trouble is that? </i>

248
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,630
<i> Uh...text me your address and I'll come pick you up. </i>

249
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,260
Okay.

250
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,560
Then...I'll go back and pack a few things and wait for you to come.

251
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,980
<i> - Okay. </i> <br> - Good. See you soon.

252
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,210
Yes.

253
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,000
I've caused you a lot of bother today. I even brought so many bags.

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,240
It's fine. When you're in difficulty,

255
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,830
if a friend won't help you, who would? Right?

256
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,660
- <i> No problem. </i> <br> - Thank you.

257
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,760
Right here.

258
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,820
Room card.

259
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,140
Okay, here we go.

260
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,600
Come in.

261
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,420
Wow! Such a big room.

262
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,280
I've never stayed in such a big house.

263
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,540
Such an amazing view of the sea.

264
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,160
This is great.

265
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,200
What's wrong? Do you need something?

266
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,630
Come here and hold the door open.

267
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,950
- I'm so happy. <br> - Hurry up.

268
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,540
Hold the door.

269
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,970
Brother Hou Jue, thank you so much. I'm really so happy.

270
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,640
If you like it, that's good.

271
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,580
Also, no one has ever treated me so well.

272
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,580
Then...don't run around more today.

273
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,150
Why don't you take a shower and get some rest?

274
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,140
Take a shower?

275
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,210
Then, is it not quite appropriate with her here?

276
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,980
I'm saying that you've been running around all day.

277
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,730
Take a shower and then get some rest.

278
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,230
You, yourself.

279
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,540
Ah. Don't take it wrong.

280
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,780
I didn't mean that.

281
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,190
- I...I... <br> - Right, right. I took it wrong. I'm sorry.

282
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,100
- I'll get some rest. <br> - Good, good. Get some rest.

283
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,760
Then, you guys can go.

284
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,250
- Bye-bye. <br> - Brother Hou Jue.

285
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,220
Will you come see me back and see me.

286
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,310
I will. Of course, I'll come see you.

287
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,190
Rest up.

288
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,730
Bye-bye.

289
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,220
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

290
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,830
Wow, such a big bathtub!

291
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,730
Lulu, that girl...

292
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,680
- is quite pitiful. <br> - Oh.

293
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,680
What's this 'Oh'? Don't you have any sympathy?

294
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,960
You need to be pitied, don't you know?

295
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,850
I don't need it.

296
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,080
I won't ask others for pity when it was my own choices that led to me where I am now.

297
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,850
That's because you're so strong.

298
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,220
You don't know how many difficulties there are in life.

299
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,510
You act like you know.

300
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,840
- Thank you. <br> - No problem. Goodbye.

301
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,340
Everything's fine.

302
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,030
Listen. The internal investigation is over. Don't worry.

303
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,800
No problems at all.

304
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,340
I've also shown Hou Zhirong.

305
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,850
He really liked it.

306
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,140
- Did he? <br> - He did. He thought highly of you.

307
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,860
He trusts you.

308
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,880
Xiaomin, I was thinking before you came

309
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,990
that you seriously need to

310
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,320
sign up on several dating websites

311
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,650
and meet a few people in person.

312
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,160
Why?

313
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,020
Are you worried that the police suspect me or you?

314
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,830
Think about it. You're the company's accountant.

315
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,420
The company's financial records are processed by you. Do you think the police won't spy on you?

316
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,850
I'm one of the higher-ups of the company.

317
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,130
I'm well aware of what's going on within the company. I have to.

318
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,280
If they suspect you, they'll suspect me too.

319
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,530
But if they find out we're dating secretly,

320
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,120
they'll suspect us even more.

321
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,600
<i>If you're going on blind dates, it means you're single, doesn't it?</i>

322
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,310
That has nothing to do with me.

323
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,940
Instead, it proves that we both have no interests or motives.

324
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,630
Then... Then I'll go on blind dates.

325
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,620
Won't you be jealous?

326
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,070
I...

327
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,220
I'm telling you to put on an act, not to really go on blind dates. Silly.

328
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,330
Xiaomin. Xiaomin.

329
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,750
Trust me.

330
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,760
Also, from tomorrow on,

331
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,610
pretend to be sick as you go to work. Then you can resign in a month.

332
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,510
What about you?

333
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,390
When are you going to resign?

334
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,400
I guess in two to three months.

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,430
Before Liu Tiehao is released from prison, I must get everything done.

336
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,570
After that, we both can get out of here and go somewhere far away.

337
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,220
Really?

338
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,680
Really.

339
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,890
Do as I say.

340
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,070
We're going to be fine.

341
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,450
Brother Wu is back.

342
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,480
Easy does it.

343
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,420
Brother Wu, you're back. Your son-in-law is so handsome!

344
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,150
- Old Wu is back! <br> - Brother Wu,

345
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,400
what are you all doing?

346
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,410
- Come here. <br> - Hou, this way.

347
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,890
Easy does it.

348
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
Dad, you...

349
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,760
I didn't come back for a week. It's dusty all over.

350
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,400
- What a mess! <br> - Where should I put it? <br> - Take a seat. Leave it to me. Take a seat.

351
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,110
Put it on the floor.

352
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,600
Uncle. Uncle, don't worry about it.

353
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
- I can handle it. <br> - Shiyi, take care of this...

354
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,250
Hou, don't...

355
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,170
- Shiyi, get your dad out of here. I'll do it. I'll do it. <br> - You just came over.

356
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,300
- You're not familiar with this. <br> - Alright. Come here.

357
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,600
- Go upstairs for a sunbath. <br> - Take care of Hou.

358
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,490
Got it. Be careful.

359
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,950
Alright. Don't do it. You can't do housework. Let me do it.

360
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,770
I can't do it but I can learn. Don't move it.

361
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,240
- Don't learn. <br> - Don't stop me.

362
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,750
Why don't you go upstairs and chat with my dad?

363
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,660
- Chat? <br> - Go ahead.

364
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,310
- Don't mess things up. <br> - Chatting's fine. I'm great at chatting.

365
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,210
Be careful. Go up from here.

366
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,420
- Uncle, why are you working again? <br> - Hou,

367
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,560
sit down. I'll do it for you.

368
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,680
Take some rest. I'll help you out.

369
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,030
Hou, get the... get the wash basin behind the door for me.

370
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,870
Sure.

371
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,550
This past week of my hospital stay has caused you so much trouble.

372
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,010
- My pleasure. No problem. <br> - The clothes need...

373
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,360
Here.

374
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,440
Uncle, why don't you look for somewhere else? It's very humid here in summer.

375
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,180
Come with me. Shiyi wants to rent a place for me.

376
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,910
I don't want to bother her too much.

377
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,260
Considering my situation,

378
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,710
it's pretty good to have a place to live in.

379
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,970
It sounds like you've gone through a lot, uncle.

380
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,500
Hou, you're not an outsider.

381
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,550
I'll be honest with you.

382
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,750
<i>Some years ago, I started a business with two of my friends.</i>

383
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,200
I lost everything.

384
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,700
Both of them flew overseas and welched on debts.

385
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,920
I didn't want to be this kind of person.

386
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,850
You should pay what you owe.

387
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,800
<i>I sold the house. Shiyi sold the car.</i>

388
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,900
But I still couldn't pay it off.

389
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,430
Now Shiyi still has to pay it for me every month.

390
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,950
Poor Shiyi.

391
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,520
<i>Shiyi may seem carefree all the time,</i>

392
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,080
<i>but she keeps many things to herself.</i>

393
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,250
Back then she was an athlete

394
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,720
and won the national championship but ended up retiring due to injury.

395
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,240
She's suffered a lot as a bodyguard over the years.

396
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,040
If it wasn't for repaying the debts for me, she would've gone overseas for training.

397
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,560
<i>So being born in the right family really matters.</i>

398
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,750
<i>Shiyi is great at everything, but not very good at being born in the right family.</i>

399
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,780
You're joking. I find Shiyi pretty good.

400
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,280
I do admire the father-daughter relationship between you both.

401
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,800
You should swap with Shiyi

402
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,770
so she could become a daughter of some rich people and live a good life for several days.

403
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,740
I'm totally fine with it. It's up to her.

404
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,280
What do you mean by that?

405
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,250
- Shiyi. <br> - What are you talking about? Here.

406
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,950
Eat some fruit.

407
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,430
Sister Fang,

408
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,630
- where are you? How long have I been waiting for you? <br> <i>- I've arrived.</i>

409
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,880
I'm here. Behind you.

410
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,850
Unbelievable. You took forever.

411
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,860
You must've waited so long.

412
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,090
Very long indeed.

413
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,730
What are you looking at?

414
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,090
Just you?

415
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,850
Who else? Just me of course.

416
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,160
No. You didn't tell me

417
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,110
about things between you and Jr. President Hou. I mean,

418
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,610
I'm not really... curious about your private life.

419
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,370
Look. If some journalist

420
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,080
found out about it and broke the news, I should know how to handle it.

421
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,350
We haven't even got to the first base.

422
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,740
Even if something happens later,

423
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,100
we'll just play it by ear. You're with me, aren't you?

424
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,150
Sure. Then we'll make it clear that you're still single with no boyfriend.

425
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,790
I've never had a boyfriend.

426
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,560
Also, I don't want to make my private life public.

427
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,040
Right?

428
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,880
That makes sense.

429
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,860
Nobody cares anyway.

430
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,850
Let's go, superstar. Please.

431
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,380
But I do hope that you'll become Mrs Hou.

432
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:47,090
<i>(Amateur Sanda Combat Training. <br> Coach: Qian Xiaoyan)</i>

433
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,150
<i>(Tuition: ¥9,000. <br> Duration: Three classes a week. 48 hours in total)</i>

434
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,840
Three classes. 48.

435
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,070
16... 9,048...

436
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,500
Over 200.

437
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,970
You need to keep it in mind, okay?

438
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,130
Be fast when throwing a punch. Get as close to the opponent as possible so you can–

439
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,370
Coach Qian!

440
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,210
- I'll let you go first. <br> - Okay.

441
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,180
Why are you here?

442
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,940
I'm here to chase you.

443
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,510
Seriously, Coach Qian... When you're wearing camouflage clothes, you're so...

444
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,770
so handsome.

445
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,680
I'd like to eat out with you.

446
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,610
Last time I said I would treat you this time. Let's go.

447
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,920
Aren't you afraid that you'll end up poor by treating me?

448
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,130
I hope so.

449
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,230
I do hope you'll make me poor by letting me treat you.

450
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,620
You're so responsible that if I ended up poor by treating you,

451
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,130
you would have to take care of me for the rest of my life.

452
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,830
Are you chasing me by being shameless?

453
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,920
Not exactly,

454
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,310
but it works.

455
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,870
Oh, they all call you Qian Qian.

456
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,340
I think I'll call you Xiaoyan, which sounds friendlier.

457
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,380
Are you serious?

458
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,090
Fine.

459
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,310
Since you're serious, I'll tell you this seriously.

460
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,680
Hai Xing, we're not a good match.

461
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,040
Not a good match at all.

462
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,050
You don't meet the expectations of my future Mr Right.

463
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,960
Don't waste time or money on me.

464
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,740
Look for a woman that's a better fit for you.

465
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,680
You're so handsome that some nice women will fall in love with you.

466
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:16,850
So... you think I'm quite handsome, don't you?

467
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,250
I said so much to you. Did you only listen to the irrelevant part?

468
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,880
No.

469
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,070
It seems the most irrelevant, but it's actually the most relevant.

470
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,850
You'd prepared what you said, which doesn't count.

471
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:40,270
People usually express something without noticing it. The truest feeling. It's called subconsciousness.

472
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,220
I'm really glad that you find me handsome. Thank you.

473
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll definitely keep working on other aspects. Let's go eat.

474
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,340
I have something to do, so I must go.

475
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,080
Also, don't call me Xiaoyan.

476
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,170
Xiaoyan! Xiaoyan, I love you!

477
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,860
You're my destiny.

478
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,340
<i>I'll marry you for sure. I want to spend my life with you.</i>

479
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,780
I'll chase you for sure. You can't escape. Xiaoyan, I love you!

480
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,870
Xiaoyan, I love you! I've fallen in love with you! I love you!

481
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,300
<i>(Dream Chasing Hotel)</i>

482
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,690
<i>Wow, I didn't know the layout is so imposing here.</i>

483
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,980
<i>Of course. This internet show is very popular.</i>

484
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,920
It took me great effort to get you in.

485
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,780
- Please wait in the car for me. <br> - Okay.

486
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,030
We're here. This opportunity was hard to get.

487
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,880
Cherish it well.

488
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,670
Yes, I know.

489
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,810
Go ahead. I'm leaving now.

490
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,550
<i>The weather is so hot today.</i>

491
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,830
- Why are you wearing so much? <br> - Not really.

492
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,080
Go. There's a new dessert shop that's really good.

493
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,970
<i> Are you ready yet?</i>

494
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,430
Listen, I really must eat that beef firepot today.

495
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,260
Don't eat so much. Your face is so big already.

496
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,760
<i>Who are you talking about? Whose face is big? Who?</i>

497
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,190
18, 19, 20,

498
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,180
21, 22, 23,

499
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,230
24, 25,

Awesome.

Treat our lunch! I can do 100 times.

Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,530
Everyone line up.

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,130
Come, come, line up. Didn't you hear what the instructor said?

506
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,690
Quick, line up in two rows. Here, hurry up.

507
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,600
Big guy, line up there.

508
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,760

Stop! Sit down!

515
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,150
Hello, everyone.

516
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,570
Welcome to Sanda Combat Training.

517
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,190
I am your instructor in Sanda Combat.

518
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,730
— My name is Qian Xiao Yan. You— <br> - Hello, Instructor Qian.

519
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,650
Today, I will demonstrate to everyone

520
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,450
the basic skills of Sanda Combat.

521
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,490
Good!

522
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,170
This student, please stand up.

523
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,020
Come out.

524
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,210
Be serious.

525
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,690
Hit me.

526
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,260
Don't make trouble.

527
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,030
Hit me.

528
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,790
I'll do it.

529
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,690
Everyone, pay attention and learn.

530
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,490
I'm coming then. I really am.

531
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,540
Shsoulder Throw.

532
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,920
Leg Throw.

533
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,930
- This move is— <br> - Hare kicks Eagle.

534
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,280
Correct answer.

535
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,320
Brother Hou Jue, I've already left the hotel, You can pay the bill.

536
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,850
<i>Okay. Where did you go?</i>

537
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,710
- Brother Hou Jue, I'm in a film crew. <br> - Really?

538
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,890
This is the room that the film crew arranged for me.

539
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,630
The condition looks a bit difficult.

540
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,620
But, it's for arts, right?

541
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,600
What arts? It's just an online show

542
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,830
called New Trainees.

543
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,450
<i>Ten girls are locked up together and go through all kinds of training.</i>

544
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,160
<i>It's filmed and streamed online. It's stupid.</i>

545
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,150
But I can't help it. I just want to support myself.

546
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,660
Are you supporting yourself? Do a good job then.

547
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,960
If there was any other way, I wouldn't want to come either.

548
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,410
- Who's that? <br> - Time to do makeup. Room 2012.

549
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,010
Okay, I heard. Thanks.

550
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,250
Okay, I won't talk anymore. Gotta work. Bye-bye.

551
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,220
Bye-bye.

552
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,990
Lu Lu, your hair is really pretty. The hair has good quality.

553
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,240
Thanks, sister.

554
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,340
I've taken a lot of care of the hair.

555
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,920
I use a hair mask every day.

556
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,870
I think I spend more money than on my face.

557
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,390
Really?

558
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,100
If we do any shampoo commercials next time,

559
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,740
- I'll recommend you then. <br> - Really?

560
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,690
This is great! Thanks, sister.

561
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,150
You're welcome.

562
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,510
You've come, sister.

563
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,530
Why are you here?

564
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,860
Why can't I be here? Does it have anything to do with you?

565
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,700
Lu Lu, do you also know that internet celebrity Dou Dou?

566
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,580
I ddon't just know her, last time at an opening event,

567
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,320
- we even had an argument. <br> - Is that true?

568
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,350
Let me tell you, she has a wicked mind.

569
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,990
Clearly I was in the center position, but she wanted to grab it.

570
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,540
Is that so? I wouldn't have known.

571
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,390
Hello, Director.

572
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,100
It's me.

573
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,790
Oh, okay, I get it.

574
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,420
Lu Lu,

575
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,590
the director wants to have your hair cut short.

576
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,470
The recognizability will be better.

577
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,250
How short?

578
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:20,030
What? You can't cut it.

579
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,630
That Dou Dou must have done a trick.

580
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,410
Sister, can you please talk to the director?

581
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,500
Just say that I look good with this length and can't cut.

582
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,900
No, no, how can I say anything?

583
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,130
It's the director's decision. I can't oppose it.

584
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,370
Besides, this is the first time

585
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,260
that I'm working with this director.

586
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,150
Lu Lu! Lu Lu!

587
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,590
