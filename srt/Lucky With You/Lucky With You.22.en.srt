00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,239
(Episode 22)

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,079
I'm really sorry.

5
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,840
It's my fault this time.

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,239
I shouldn't have brought you here to apologize to her.

7
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,480
Hit me twice if you're mad. Don't be mad.

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,239
Why should I slap you? I want to slap her.

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,439
Let's do it now. Come on.

10
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,599
Enough.

11
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,879
What should I do now?

12
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
We have messed up.

13
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,040
I think she's the one who should be worried.

14
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,640
My dad has seen her true colors.

15
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,239
If I'm not mistaken,

16
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,719
I don't think she will ever appear in my life again.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
Hou Jue.

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
Look at this.

19
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,759
Just wait. I'll have good news for you.

20
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,560
Dad.

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,280
You saw everything, right?

22
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,599
That's ridiculous.

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
She was not showing respect at all.

24
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,199
- She really went overboard today. - She's too much.

25
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
No one else behaves like her.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,039
But Chen Chen is very persistent on this matter.

27
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,039
Her dad is embarrassed too.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,479
She wanted us to fire Wu Shi Yi.

29
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,000
What should we do?

30
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,719
What's there to be persistent?

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,719
She's the one who cursed and she's also the one who poured the wine.

32
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,560
She has no right to say anything now.

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,599
She should be grateful that we are not going after her.

34
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,879
She still won't let it go.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,159
Hou Jue.

36
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,080
Do you really not know...

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,520
why I want you to marry her?

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,639
I know.

39
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,919
You do it for the company, right?

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm glad you know.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,199
Then you should know what to do next.

42
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,800
No, Dad.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
Our company is growing.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,960
We will still be where we will be even without her.

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,039
Am I right?

46
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,120
But you asked me to be with her.

47
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,439
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,120
Even if you don't end up with Chen Chen...

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,759
and form an alliance with them,

50
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,120
we can't afford to have another enemy...

51
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,960
because of Wu Shi Yi.

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,080
Am I right?

53
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,599
Wu Shi Yi has performed quite well recently.

54
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,000
To be honest, I don't want to fire her.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
But I can't afford to risk my relationship with the Chens...

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,159
just because of her.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,520
It's not worth it.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,639
You tell me.

59
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,479
It is not worth it to you.

60
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,639
But not for me.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,759
After I met Shi Yi,

62
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,360
I got to know myself all over again.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,520
I learned responsibility, money, and happiness...

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,800
all over again.

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
I have new ideas about them.

66
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,719
My whole life used to be chaos.

67
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,439
I couldn't see the world clearly.

68
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,759
I just started...

69
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,039
opening my eyes to see the world bit by bit.

70
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,560
Why should we fire Shi Yi?

71
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,050
Is everything she said the truth?

72
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,519
Why do you listen to everything she says?

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,439
You never listen to me.

74
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,680
Does that mean everything I'm saying is nonsense?

75
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,680
Because she didn't say anything.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,399
I observe what she does.

77
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,000
We can't fire Shi Yi as Chen Chen is being unreasonable.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It doesn't make sense.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
If you say so,

80
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,360
that's more the reason why I have to fire Wu Shi Yi today.

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,680
I will never let you be with her.

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,079
It's impossible!

83
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,759
I'm not asking anyone to set up a worldview for me.

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,839
- It's all you... - Don't say anything!

85
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,480
Who gave you everything?

86
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,480
If it weren't for our family business,

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,050
you're nothing right now.

88
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,319
You have no right to oppose me.

89
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,519
You don't get to make your own decisions.

90
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,170
Get rid of her now.

91
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Immediately. Right now!

92
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,879
No way.

93
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,610
Hou Jue.

94
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,079
I guess...

95
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,519
I have to make myself clear.

96
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,079
All that you have now...

97
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,839
is all from me...

98
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,360
including Wu Shi Yi.

99
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,319
I'm the one who signed the contract with the security company.

100
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,839
I'm the one who pays her.

101
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,560
I can cancel my contract with her at any time.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
There's no need to ask for your opinion.

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,759
To me, your opinion...

104
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,519
is nothing.

105
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,040
Did I hurt your feelings?

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,120
I didn't do it to hurt you.

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
I want you to understand...

108
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,879
what reality is.

109
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,000
I've arranged your future for you.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
Just do as I say.

111
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Do it step by step and you are good.

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,480
It's as simple as that.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,800
I don't want to do that.

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,240
You don't?

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,079
You don't want what?

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,439
Are you not going to inherit your family business?

117
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,720
Yes or no?

118
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,639
If...

119
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,399
If I were to be like a puppet...

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,120
fully under your control,

121
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,480
then I don't want to.

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,000
If I were to marry a woman of your choice,

123
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
then I don't want to.

124
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,839
If everything had to go your way,

125
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,199
then I don't want to.

126
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,720
I thank you for raising me.

127
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
I'll repay you someday.

128
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,720
I thank you for everything.

129
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,839
I'll make it up to you today.

130
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,040
Hey.

131
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,560
Make some space for me.

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,199
I'm going to sleep at your place tonight.

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,879
What? Cut the nonsense.

134
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,439
I'm leaving the company and Hou Zhi Rong.

135
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,519
Hurry up.

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,560
What's going on? Why all of a sudden?

137
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,800
It's not sudden.

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,879
It should've happened a long time ago.

139
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,279
If it's because of me...

140
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,759
Stop messing around.

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
It's between me and Hou Zhi Rong.

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,160
It has nothing to do with anyone.

143
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,759
Hurry up. I need to pack my things.

144
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,240
You're back.

145
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,519
I made some soup. Do you want some?

146
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,840
I won't be eating at home. I won't eat at home from now on.

147
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,480
How could you say that?

148
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,360
What's wrong?

149
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,919
Did he have another fight with his dad?

150
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,240
It's worse than a fight.

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,519
He said he's leaving his dad...

152
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,879
to go out and do something on his own.

153
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,519
Gosh, how could he say that?

154
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,330
He's not capable of that.

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,330
This lad...

156
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,450
Do you know?

157
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,799
He has never suffered as a child.

158
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,120
Now, he is venturing into society all by himself.

159
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,600
There's no way he can stand it.

160
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,480
When he can't take it anymore, he will come back.

161
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't worry.

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,519
He is just throwing a tantrum like a kid.

163
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
It won't last long.

164
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,919
Yes.

165
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:25,279
He has always been willful ever since he was little.

166
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,360
Don't worry.

167
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,279
I'll do my best to take care of him in the next two days.

168
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't cry.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,639
Talk to him for me later.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,159
Okay.

171
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,480
Ms. Zhang.

172
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
In this house, you're the one I'm going to miss the most.

173
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,039
Don't be sad.

174
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,600
I'll work hard after this.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,559
I'll come back for you soon.

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,159
No.

177
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,000
You fought with your dad before too, but everything was fine.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,120
How did things end up like this now?

179
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
My dad is being unreasonable.

180
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm actually responsible for this too.

181
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,600
In order to protect me,

182
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,200
things are falling apart between them.

183
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhang.

184
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't be sad.

185
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,720
Hold on.

186
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,879
What are you waiting for?

187
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,320
Pack your things.

188
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,679
I'll wait a little longer.

189
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,200
Maybe you'll change your mind.

190
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,399
It won't change.

191
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,639
Let's pack up.

192
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Okay.

193
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,799
I'll pack my things then.

194
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,039
You...

195
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,679
Are you taking this with you?

196
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,919
Are you not coming back again?

197
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,039
I feel safe when it's around.

198
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Here.

199
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,159
These are the clothes I packed for you.

200
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
Okay.

201
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Take the money.

202
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,879
I won't take another penny from Hou Zhi Rong.

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,440
This isn't his.

204
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,559
This is mine. Take it.

205
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,440
All the more reason not to take it. You should keep it for yourself.

206
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,879
Don't give it to me. I have a lot of money.

207
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,240
Take it.

208
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,919
I'll get angry if you won't take it.

209
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Take it.

210
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,600
Okay, I'm taking it.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,159
I have taken it.

212
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,480
I have taken it.

213
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,200
All right, don't cry.

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
I don't want you to go.

215
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
It's okay.

216
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,720
Come back soon.

217
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,240
I'll make a lot of money from now on.

218
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't cry. Be good.

219
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
I don't want you to go.

220
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,639
Bye, Ms. Zhang.

221
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,240
I'm leaving.

222
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
I'm leaving.

223
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,440
We are leaving, Ms. Zhang.

224
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't worry.

225
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,080
("By Your Side")

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
None of these songs...

227
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,879
matches my current mood.

228
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,320
How do you feel?

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,639
I'm happy.

230
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,879
I'm lighthearted.

231
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,240
I feel free. I feel relaxed.

232
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,440
I feel carefree and easy.

233
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,519
Are you really that happy?

234
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,799
I'm exceptionally happy.

235
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,360
If you regret it, there's still time to go back.

236
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,840
That's impossible.

237
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,879
Move forward.

238
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,840
Don't stop. Don't hesitate.

239
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,799
Make a right turn, step on the gas, and accelerate.

240
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,840
Okay.

241
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,360
I'll let you enjoy the happiness for now.

242
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
You're in for a hard time.

243
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,279
What's happening?

244
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
Take my luggage.

245
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,480
Little brat.

246
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
Are you having teenage rebellion?

247
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,360
Why are you leaving home?

248
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,919
You make me speechless.

249
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,840
Is that all?

250
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,879
Your mom is here too.

251
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,440
What's happening?

252
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,200
Who are you trying to pick a fight with?

253
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,480
You are so impulsive.

254
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,240
I'm drawing the line with Hou Zhi Rong.

255
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,960
You should have done it earlier.

256
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,919
- Is the room ready? - Yes.

257
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,399
I have cleaned up the room for you.

258
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,519
Don't be surprised.

259
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,960
It's nothing compared to your mansion.

260
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,120
I even brought a deposit. I won't be disgusted by the room.

261
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,840
- Take it. - Get lost!

262
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,879
- Take it. - Get lost!

263
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,720
- I'm going to throw it away. - Do it.

264
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,840
Put it back.

265
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,440
Stop wasting money. You're such a spendthrift! Come on.

266
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,919
Let's go.

267
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Mr. Hou, Ms. Zhang is here.

268
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,200
Tell her I'll be right down.

269
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
Okay.

270
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,440
Ms. Zhang.

271
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,650
What are you doing here at this hour?

272
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,279
I can't sleep.

273
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,359
Is that why you made soup for me?

274
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,240
Who made you soup?

275
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,200
What soup is this?

276
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,519
Wintermelon and pork belly soup.

277
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,559
It helps to remove heatiness.

278
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,650
It's good.

279
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,559
I'm not cooking for you.

280
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,039
I made it for Hou Jue.

281
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,519
He moved out...

282
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:29,759
before he had the soup.

283
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,680
Did he say where he was going?

284
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,079
No, he didn't.

285
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
He didn't bring anything.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,279
Is that woman still following him?

287
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,759
Yes.

288
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,039
Fortunately, Shi Yi was around.

289
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,119
I was wondering why you weren't worried at all.

290
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,359
I'm telling you.

291
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,410
This time around,

292
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,680
it's different from studying abroad.

293
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,960
Back then, his family supported him.

294
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,359
Why are you worried, Ms. Zhang?

295
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,759
This kid...

296
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,119
He doesn't know how lucky he is.

297
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,170
Once he faces problems...

298
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,839
or he is bullied out there,

299
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,519
he will come back.

300
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,680
How could you say that?

301
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,960
Look at you.

302
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,279
Can't you talk to him nicely?

303
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,799
Can't you...

304
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,279
Can't you just talk it out peacefully?

305
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,519
Must you argue with him all the time?

306
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,359
His mom is long gone.

307
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,759
If she knew about this,

308
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,359
what would she think?

309
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
Eat it.

310
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,480
Eat the soup and think about it.

311
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,519
I'll get going.

312
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,559
Excuse me.

313
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,799
We're closed.

314
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,119
Okay.

315
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,960
(Xing and Eight Guests)

316
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Monkey.

317
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,650
Judging from what you said,

318
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,039
your dad couldn't be more irritating.

319
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,079
You just see.

320
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,920
If one day he falls into my hands,

321
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,440
I'll punish him for you.

322
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,240
That's my dad.

323
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
Just kidding.

324
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,720
I'm just saying it for fun.

325
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,410
Your dad is powerful.

326
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,519
Who am I to punish him, right?

327
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,839
Speaking of which,

328
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,039
you run away from home.

329
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
Don't you think you have crossed the line?

330
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,519
You didn't even bring a pair of socks.

331
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,359
Shi Yi was by my side.

332
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,759
It's not convenient.

333
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,759
If not, I won't even take my clothes.

334
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,799
I would come running around naked.

335
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,039
I won't take anything from him.

336
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,960
I just ate. Don't make me sick.

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,920
What do you plan to do next?

338
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,839
I'm opening a company.

339
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,359
Starting tomorrow,

340
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,039
I'll prepare the company.

341
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,799
Look around.

342
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,839
Hire someone for me first.

343
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,480
I may need dozens of employees at the beginning.

344
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,599
I'll look for a high-end office tomorrow.

345
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,170
I will start renting an office.

346
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,519
Fine, you're scaring me.

347
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,680
Look, this is just a small restaurant.

348
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,519
It's just a small restaurant,

349
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,119
but do you have any idea what I went through to have this?

350
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,359
Do you know how much I suffered?

351
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,799
And you target to hire dozens of people?

352
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,079
That's very bold of you.

353
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,599
You can't stand hardships. You still...

354
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,680
Shut up. Are you looking down on me?

355
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,039
I hate to break it to you, Monkey.

356
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,319
Do you really think those self-made men...

357
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,410
really started from scratch?

358
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,079
You should at least have a starting fund.

359
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,200
You'd need a computer at least for a start.

360
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,279
I don't have a computer here.

361
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,119
You can't just go out and rob someone, right?

362
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,960
Money is not a problem.

363
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,000
No problem. Where's the money?

364
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,079
What?

365
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,160
Jade.

366
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,839
Where did you get this?

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,200
It belonged to my mom.

368
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,440
Monkey.

369
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,480
What do you mean?

370
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,880
Are you going to sell it?

371
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,480
It's very valuable.

372
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:35,200
Monkey.

373
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,119
I don't think it's a good idea.

374
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,839
It belonged to your mom.

375
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,640
It's pretty important. Take it back.

376
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,680
If worse comes to worst...

377
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,720
What?

378
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,720
I'll put it on a mortgage...

379
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,200
to round up the funds.

380
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,160
I'll get it back next month.

381
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
No, I'm serious.

382
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,400
If you really can't do it,

383
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
I will...

384
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,200
What do you have? Do you have jade?

385
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,000
I...

386
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,119
I'll introduce you to a jade seller.

387
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,519
Let me ask around.

388
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,359
I think our chef has a relative who does that.

389
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,799
Mr. Tian.

390
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,839
- What is it? - Come, I want to ask you something.

391
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,640
- What is it about? - Didn't you tell me before...

392
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,799
that you have a relative selling jade or something?

393
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,039
You're talking about my brother.

394
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,400
He owns a shop that buys jadeite collections.

395
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,160
- What is it? - Your brother?

396
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,640
- My brother. - That's great.

397
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,920
Monkey.

398
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,920
Your brother is in luck.

399
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,559
Tell your brother.

400
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,559
I have a fine piece of jade here.

401
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I'll put it on a mortgage.

402
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,960
Tell him to give me a loan of five million yuan first.

403
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,400
- Five million yuan? - Five million yuan?

404
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,680
Of course.

405
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,960
You need to show it to him.

406
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,480
Just find out from him how much I can get.

407
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,400
Let me make myself clear.

408
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,640
He's...

409
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,000
kind of weird.

410
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,359
What do you mean weird?

411
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,359
He's just a bit weird.

412
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,920
He has a catchphrase.

413
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,960
Everything is destined.

414
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,400
When he sees someone he likes,

415
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,920
he would say yes to anything.

416
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
If he doesn't like something,

417
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,640
no matter what you do, he won't listen to you.

418
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,279
It's just the personality of a rich man.

419
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,359
Give me a break.

420
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,079
That doesn't sound good. Keep your jade away.

421
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,759
- Put it away. We'll figure it out. - It's destiny.

422
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,480
Let's go and have a look.

423
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,680
I'll get changed and let's go.

424
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
Are we going now?

425
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,759
Yes, I need money.

426
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,079
Give me a break.

427
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,599
He must be sleeping at home at this hour.

428
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,599
Forget it.

429
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,599
No. They're closed during the day.

430
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,599
They only open at night.

431
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,319
Look, it's fate.

432
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,440
Enough! We are not going there.

433
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,160
Go back to the kitchen. I'm busy tonight.

434
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,240
We can't go today. We'll talk tomorrow.

435
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,640
- I'll give him a call. - Go.

436
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,880
I need to contact him.

437
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,640
Well...

438
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,599
Monkey, it doesn't have to be that way.

439
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,240
Have you made up your mind?

440
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,160
- Here. - Don't worry.

441
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,440
Have some soup.

442
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Thank you, have a seat.

443
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,119
Thank you.

444
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,039
Shi Yi.

445
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,559
I have something to tell you.

446
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,960
Go ahead.

447
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,599
After leaving Zhirong Construction,

448
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,079
I'll set up my own business...

449
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,279
and draw the line with my dad.

450
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,000
I got nothing on him.

451
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,839
But there's something...

452
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
connecting me and my dad.

453
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,039
That is your contract.

454
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,680
So I plan...

455
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,279
to go to your office...

456
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,359
after I get my money in the next two days.

457
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,440
I want you to work with me one-on-one.

458
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,359
I'll officially make you mine.

459
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,079
How is it?

460
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,519
It's not complicated.

461
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,880
According to the contract, I have to protect you.

462
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,400
So whether you're Hou Jue or Mr. Hou Junior,

463
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,559
it's the same.

464
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,640
Okay.

465
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,759
I'm relieved to know that you're so reliable.

466
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,880
Have some soup. Here.

467
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,640
No, I just had some. It's for you.

468
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,240
It's destiny.

469
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,079
Good morning, Ms. Hong.

470
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,480
- Good morning, Mr. Ma. - Here.

471
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,359
Have you heard?

472
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,519
Tian Min resigned.

473
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,000
Now you can't gossip about me again.

474
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,759
When did that happen?

475
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,160
She handed over her work before going home last weekend.

476
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,480
Why so suddenly?

477
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
What is the reason?

478
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,400
I heard it's personal.

479
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,000
Girls these days are too carefree.

480
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,799
Hello.

481
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,920
The number you have dialed is busy.

482
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,039
Please try again later. Sorry...

483
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,240
Hello.

484
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,559
The number you have dialed is busy.

485
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,200
- Please try again later. - Sorry.

486
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
The subscriber you dialed...

487
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,240
Hello.

488
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
The number you have dialed is busy.

489
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,599
- Please try again later. - Sorry.

490
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,279
The number you have dialed is busy.

491
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,799
Hello.

492
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,799
Is Tian Min here?

493
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,000
You are...

494
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,599
I'm her colleague at work.

495
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,599
I have something to give her.

496
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,920
She moved.

497
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,599
She moved?

498
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,400
When did she move?

499
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Three days ago.

500
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
My brother's shop...

501
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,599
is three shops away.

502
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,079
Well, we have...

503
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,599
to hide this from Shi Yi.

504
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,200
Try to get rid of her.

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,119
Shi Yi.

506
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,640
Mr. Tian's brother...

507
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,759
doesn't like girls.

508
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,720
Well, he wouldn't let women in.

509
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,720
- That's a rule? - Yes.

510
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,160
- Why don't I know? - You knew it, right?

511
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,720
Yes.

512
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,039
When my brother was young,

513
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,279
he seemed to have been hit hard by love.

514
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,519
Normally, he doesn't see any women,

515
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,599
especially beautiful women.

516
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,079
He won't say anything when he sees girls.

517
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,119
That's too bad.

518
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,200
- Don't worry. We're with him. - We're here.

519
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,480
This is the place.

520
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
It won't take long.

521
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,640
This is the place.

522
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,039
Come in.

523
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,480
That's mysterious.

524
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,319
It's okay.

525
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,440
This is my brother's shop.

526
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
It's safe.

527
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,599
Wait outside.

528
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
I'll close the door.

529
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,599
My brother.

530
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,039
You're all here.

531
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,119
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,839
My brother is always mysterious.

533
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,400
Hey.

534
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,079
This is the boss I was telling you about.

535
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,559
He is my boss's friend.

536
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,839
Hello. What's your name?

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Just call him Mr. Liang.

538
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,039
Hi, Mr. Liang.

539
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,960
Take a look.

540
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
This is my jade.

541
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,599
What is its worth now?

542
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,799
It's obvious.

543
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,400
It's obvious?

544
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,559
It's obvious.

545
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,359
It's great stuff.

546
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,000
It's an icy emerald.

547
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,359
Isn't it good stuff?

548
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,880
How much can I get for it now?

549
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,759
The market price is...

550
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,319
approximately...

551
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,519
It's worth 300,000 yuan.

552
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Three hundred thousand yuan?

553
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,160
It's okay.

554
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,160
The market isn't doing well now, is it?

555
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,400
The economy is bad.

556
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,720
The price is about right.

557
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,839
But...

558
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,599
it's good stuff.

559
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,200
There's no need to sell it.

560
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,720
Jade is all about fate.

561
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,720
Now that it's in your hands,

562
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,279
why do you want to sell it?

563
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,119
Save it for later.

564
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,400
Furthermore,

565
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,599
there's plenty of room for improvement.

566
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,359
He doesn't have a choice.

567
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,119
Moreover, he is penniless.

568
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,880
That's all that's left.

569
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,279
They're quite nice to me.

570
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,400
Just do him a favor.

571
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,240
If I had another choice,

572
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,359
I wouldn't have pawned something...

573
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,519
that belonged to my mom.

574
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,200
Since you have brought it to me,

575
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,920
it means it's fate.

576
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
How about this?

577
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,200
I'll give you 100,000 yuan.

578
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,359
You pawn it on me first.

579
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,039
In half a year,

580
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:32,599
buy it back if you have the money.

581
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,359
If you can't pay me with anything else,

582
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,240
I'll charge you a little interest.

583
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,039
What do you think?

584
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,000
That's a good idea.

585
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,680
Sure.

586
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll leave this with you first.

587
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,720
Please take good care of it.

588
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,359
I'm sure I'll get it back.

589
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,079
You can go now.

590
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,480
I'll transfer the money to your account.

591
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,319
Yes.

592
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,680
We'll get going then.

593
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,960
Come on.

594
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,680
- Keep it. - Thank you. Let's go.

595
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:07,319
We'll get going then.

596
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,519
Stop.

597
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,039
What you are holding...

598
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,839
Put it back where you got it.

599
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
Cheapskate.

600
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,759
Thank you.

601
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,440
- Go. - You look like him.

602
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
He's my brother.

603
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,440
You were boasting. You said it's worth five million yuan.

604
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,039
Like I said, the market is not doing well.

605
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,039
I'm leaving.

606
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,160
Okay.

607
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,000
Does your brother have the authority?

608
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,880
The "Antiques Roadshow" invited him to be the judge,

609
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,400
- but he refused to go. - Do you think he's a pro?

610
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,960
Life...

611
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,079
There are ups and downs.

612
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,680
But in my case, there are only downs.

613
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,880
What were you doing in there?

614
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,079
What did you sell?

615
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,640
Selling what? His brother has two projects.

616
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm thinking about investing in it.

617
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,599
It's a big project.

618
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,759
Since I didn't invest in any,

619
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,240
I'll use the money to pay the rent.

620
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,519
I can't be a freeloader.

621
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,519
Get lost.

622
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,319
Are you serious?

623
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,799
You have always been a freeloader.

624
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,079
Okay.

625
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,920
Hello.

626
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,960
The number you have dialed is busy.

627
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:44,480
Who is it?

628
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,840
Tian Min.

629
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,559
Let me in.

630
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
Go away.

631
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,920
Hear me out.

632
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,360
Why did you resign?

633
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,289
Tell me.

634
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,119
- Why are you avoiding me? - I don't want to see you right now.

635
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,480
I don't want to say anything to you.

636
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,559
Can you leave?

637
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,440
If you don't let me in, I'll stay here today.

638
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,480
I'm not going anywhere.

639
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,599
Don't think you can go anywhere.

640
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,719
How did you find this place?

641
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
See for yourself.

642
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,960
I tracked your phone and tracked you down.

643
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,920
I found you.

644
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,880
You can't hide from me.

645
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,239
Tian Min.

646
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,079
Open the door.

647
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,119
Open the door!

648
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,559
It's okay.

649
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,880
You know what?

650
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,440
You left without a word.

651
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,360
Do you know how worried I was?

652
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,199
I thought something happened to you.

653
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,440
You almost scared me to death.

654
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,199
Ma Yong.

655
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,480
You've gone too far now.

656
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,079
I feel so bad...

657
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,119
seeing you like this.

658
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,079
But...

659
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,239
But I can't possibly...

660
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,920
help you anymore.

661
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:57,199
I can't face my conscience, do you know that?

662
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,840
I can't help you anymore.

663
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:01,840
I know.

664
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,920
It's all for my own good.

665
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay.

666
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,289
You don't have to help me.

667
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't need your help anymore.

668
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,119
But promise me one thing, Tian Min.

669
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:20,239
Promise me you won't go anywhere.

670
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,440
Stay here.

671
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,960
Please don't leave me.

672
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Ma Yong.

673
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:30,840
Ma Yong.

674
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,599
Didn't you...

675
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,559
Didn't you tell me...

676
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,769
that you're going to take me away?

677
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,559
Just do as I say. Stop it.

678
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,719
Tian Min.

679
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:43,039
Tian Min.

680
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,159
I'll keep my promise.

681
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,289
Trust me.

682
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:49,960
But I beg you.

683
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,159
Don't...

684
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,159
No, you...

685
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,639
For the next two to three months,

686
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,639
stay out of my business, okay?

687
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,079
How can I do that?

688
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,880
- How can I leave you alone? - Stay out of this.

689
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,000
Can't you let go for our sake?

690
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Tian Min, I...

691
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,599
- Why should I let go? - I...

692
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,719
No.

693
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,519
Why should I let go?

694
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,480
Why do I have to let go?

695
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,519
Why?

696
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,719
It's for our life...

697
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,000
and our future.

698
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:13,519
Am I wrong?

699
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm fighting for what I deserve.

700
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,199
Am I wrong?

701
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,400
I'm telling you.

702
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,480
I won't let him be.

703
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,440
I want him to break down. Do you understand?

704
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,329
I want him to break down.

705
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,639
Why are you still awake?

706
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,719
I can't sleep.

707
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,360
Do you believe in constellations?

708
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,199
Constellations?

709
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,440
I don't know much about it.

710
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,960
But when I was young,

711
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,880
my mom taught me how to see constellations.

712
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:21,809
For example, Sirius,

713
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,119
Orion,

714
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,440
Vega, and others.

715
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,000
They used to be busy with work.

716
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,239
They were often away from home.

717
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,809
I would sit alone on the balcony and look at the stars.

718
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,000
The fine dust level is so high these days.

719
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,480
I can't see the stars at all.

720
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,599
I used to watch the stars all the time too.

721
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,840
But I'm not looking at constellations.

722
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,400
I was looking for my mom.

723
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,519
My dad told me that my mom didn't die.

724
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,239
He said my mom became a star and stayed with me in heaven.

725
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,329
I would be looking for my mom at home every day.

726
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,599
Later, I bought a telescope and watched the sky every day.

727
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,400
If I didn't study design back then,

728
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,519
our country would have...

729
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,239
a great astronomer by now.

730
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,480
It's a glorious night, but I'm all alone.

731
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
I lie down and look at the stars.

732
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:09,119
Counting stars on the balcony at night.

733
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,000
One, two, three, and four.

734
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,920
You are cultured.

735
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:25,679
Thank you for staying by my side.

736
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,719
Do you think it's worth it?
