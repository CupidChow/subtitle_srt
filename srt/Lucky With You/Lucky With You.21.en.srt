(Episode 21)

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,120
You're at a crossroads in life...

5
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,439
and you have two choices before you.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,239
One of them is a flat road...

7
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,799
while another is a bumpy road.

8
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,040
In the end, death is the direction they take.

9
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,280
You hesitated for a long time at the junction,

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
not knowing what to do.

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,959
That's why you are seeking help from me.

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm telling you.

13
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,200
If this was back in the day...

14
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,959
I would choose the smooth road.

15
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,960
I really enjoy living a carefree life every day.

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,599
I'm relaxed and happy.

17
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,840
There's no pressure...

18
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,599
- and I don't have to think much. - I know.

19
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,879
But...

20
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,639
recently,

21
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,560
I have a new sentiment about my life.

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,919
I think...

23
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,879
people should live a more fruitful life.

24
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,479
We have to go through more ups and downs.

25
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,090
We should encounter different things.

26
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,280
We should let different colors fill up our lives.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
We should enrich our lives with different flavors.

28
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,560
That way, our lives...

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,319
will be more meaningful.

30
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,960
But your life will surely be a lot more tiring that way.

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Everything you do is tiring.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,479
But every day, on this rough and rugged road,

33
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,199
you'll meet different people...

34
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,879
and different things.

35
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,360
You'll be fooled by a lot of different things...

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,719
and get beat up.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,759
But these things will all turn into your scales...

38
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,240
and your armor.

39
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,240
They will enrich your life...

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,000
and allow yourself...

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,719
to grow stronger in the future.

42
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,840
These experiences will make your life...

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,439
very interesting.

44
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,879
People especially like those who are interesting.

45
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,639
Do you want to be liked?

46
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,120
No.

47
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,479
That's because when I'm tired,

48
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,879
all I want to do is eat and sleep.

49
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,719
I don't want to do anything or think about anything.

50
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,080
How relaxing is that?

51
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,840
But...

52
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,680
I think if I were to really live a life like that,

53
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
then I may end up envying...

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,759
those who are busy, always running around,

55
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,560
and have a lot to do.

56
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,039
People are always so indecisive, aren't they?

57
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,319
Yes. People are like that.

58
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,080
You want to take a vacation when you go to school.

59
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,560
When you're on vacation, you want to go to school.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,759
When you're working every day, you want to rest.

61
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,719
But you want to start working as soon as you take a break.

62
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,960
Everyone is like that.

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
I understand.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,719
So you're saying...

65
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,159
people should live a more fruitful, exciting,

66
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,520
and meaningful life, right?

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
Torture yourself.

68
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,759
I think your presence...

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,879
is already torturing enough.

70
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,479
It's also fruitful and exciting enough.

71
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,919
Let's sleep.

72
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,319
Sleep.

73
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,120
- Are we not talking anymore? - No.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,730
I was just getting fired up.

75
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,050
I hope my nagging today...

76
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,079
brought a bit of help...

77
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,800
to your path of life.

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,920
I'm going.

79
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,879
Good night.

80
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
Sleep tight.

82
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,399
Mr. Sheng, are you looking for Mr. Hou...

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,879
Go and open the door for me.

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,720
Mr. Sheng, are you all right?

85
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,160
Is it swollen?

86
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,399
No.

87
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,680
- What about my hairstyle? - It's fine.

88
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,000
Go and open the door.

89
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,000
- Mr. Sheng, please wait. - Shut up.

90
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,759
Mr. Sheng.

91
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,439
This...

92
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,480
What brings you here?

93
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,000
From the look of it,

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,480
it seems like you're here to interrogate me.

95
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,519
Did I do something wrong that upsets you?

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,160
Stop talking about useless things.

97
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,759
We've worked together for so many years.

98
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,519
We've had arguments and got angry at each other.

99
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,439
But luckily, we both have straightforward personalities.

100
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,000
We're fine after we talk things out and put things behind us.

101
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,480
That's why our relationship has lasted until today.

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,959
Am I right?

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,439
That's right, Mr. Sheng.

104
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,279
You're suddenly saying all these things. It's making me...

105
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,480
What's going on?

106
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,160
Did someone upset you or something?

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
Honestly, this matter is quite humiliating.

108
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,680
Originally, our kids...

109
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,519
should be handling matters by themselves.

110
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
Am I right?

111
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:20,560
But my kid is a girl.

112
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,279
So...

113
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,680
So I'm taking advantage of this to complain a little.

114
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,439
My dear friend,

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,079
you have been helping me all these years.

116
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,319
How are you taking advantage of me?

117
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,680
Did Hou Jue...

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,560
make Chen Chen angry?

119
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,920
Is that right, my friend?

120
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,240
Initially, our plan was...

121
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,600
if they can be together,

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,279
then the two of us...

123
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,319
can take our business relationship a step further.

124
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,120
We'll become relatives.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,519
Am I right?

126
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,839
You're absolutely right.

127
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,120
This is a good thing.

128
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,879
- Yes. - That's right.

129
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,199
If they're not meant to be,

130
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,600
we can just let this go...

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,879
and can keep doing our business.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,639
After all, this is just our wishful thinking.

133
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,720
Isn't that right?

134
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,439
That's right.

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,279
If he doesn't like Chen Chen,

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,480
that's okay.

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,519
I had her at an old age.

138
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,319
My child has always been spoiled,

139
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,199
so she has a lot of bad habits.

140
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,039
But even so,

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,720
there are several handsome and successful young men...

142
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,360
lining up to pursue her.

143
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,600
- Do you believe that? - I do.

144
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,210
Mr. Sheng, honestly, I even think...

145
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,480
Chen Chen is a bit out of Hou Jue's league.

146
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,960
That's how I truly feel.

147
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,759
But I don't understand.

148
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,279
I didn't hear Hou Jue mention...

149
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,039
how he angered Chen Chen either.

150
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,759
How?

151
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,519
If I tell you,

152
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,120
you'll feel humiliated too.

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,879
Tell me.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Your son sure is something.

155
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,330
Not only did he not protect Chen Chen,

156
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,519
but he even sided with that female bodyguard instead.

157
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,090
He even scolded Chen Chen...

158
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,879
in front of so many people.

159
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,559
I can't accept this.

160
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,720
That jerk!

161
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,450
I'm so mad.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
How could he do such a thing?

163
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,240
Even I'm mad just hearing about it, let alone you.

164
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,759
I'm serious.

165
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,159
Mr. Sheng.

166
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,039
Mr. Sheng.

167
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,840
Calm down first.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,330
On behalf of Hou Jue,

169
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,330
I apologize to you and Chen Chen.

170
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,919
I sincerely apologize.

171
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,519
It's Hou Jue's problem.

172
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,039
I'll definitely teach him a lesson later.

173
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,210
Regarding your apology,

174
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,840
I'll reluctantly accept it.

175
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,210
But for my daughter,

176
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,720
I can't let go of this.

177
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,559
You're right.

178
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,840
I know.

179
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,759
Chen Chen is your precious daughter.

180
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,279
Never mind you, even I can't stand it...

181
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,799
after hearing this.

182
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,210
Whoever upsets Chen Chen...

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,330
is going against you.

184
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,919
How about this, Mr. Sheng?

185
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,840
Please calm down first.

186
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,559
Later on, come to my clubhouse.

187
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll arrange it.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,840
Bring Chen Chen over.

189
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll bring that punk...

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
and make him apologize to Chen Chen...

191
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,600
in front of both of you.

192
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
You can do whatever you want with him then.

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,879
Does that sound good?

194
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,679
What about that female bodyguard?

195
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,639
That's easy.

196
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,879
It's a small matter.

197
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll just let her go.

198
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,759
What do you say, old friend?

199
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,200
Brew me some tea.

200
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, I'll brew some tea.

201
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,480
The interior design of your company...

202
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,279
really doesn't make sense.

203
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,120
Hello.

204
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay, I got it.

205
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Mr. Hou wants to see me. I'm going over there.

206
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,639
It must be about that stupid matter with Chen Chen.

207
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,279
I don't know.

208
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,360
- I'll go with you. - It's okay.

209
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,799
He told me to go alone. He didn't ask for you.

210
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,879
It's okay.

211
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,720
I'll be your bodyguard today. Come on.

212
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,120
Mr. Hou Junior, Mr. Hou...

213
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,919
- Wait for me at the door. - Come in.

214
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,039
Mr. Hou, did you ask for me?

215
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,039
Have a seat.

216
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,600
Shi Yi.

217
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,039
You've been with the company...

218
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,080
for almost two months now, right?

219
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,759
Although there were ups and downs...

220
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,080
and you experienced several obstacles,

221
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,799
no matter what happens,

222
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,720
you've always fulfilled your duty...

223
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,159
and done your job well.

224
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,120
As your client, I'm very satisfied with that.

225
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,960
Thank you, Mr. Hou.

226
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,120
Back then, I recruited a female bodyguard for Hou Jue...

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,480
because I like how they're composed and meticulous.

228
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Not only do you have to keep him safe,

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
at the same time, you must also restrain his behavior...

230
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,120
and not let him stir up trouble.

231
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,679
However, it seems like...

232
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,039
I was too simpleminded.

233
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,120
Having a single man and woman...

234
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,360
spend 24 hours a day together...

235
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,240
is bound to trigger some chemistry.

236
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,480
Actually, I can understand that.

237
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,360
Even if you're raising a pet,

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
feelings will grow as time goes by,

239
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,840
let alone two people.

240
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,080
Our company has a very specific rule about that.

241
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,840
We can't date our employers.

242
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,240
I'll strictly abide by it. Don't worry.

243
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't care if you date or not.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
You're free to date whoever you want.

245
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
But when it comes to marriage,

246
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,120
Hou Jue definitely cannot make his own decision.

247
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,879
That's Hou Jue's destiny.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,399
Hou Jue's marriage isn't just about him.

249
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,879
It's also an important matter to the company.

250
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,879
Shi Yi.

251
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,480
I'll be honest with you.

252
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,120
The current market environment...

253
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
isn't as good as before.

254
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,600
The bigger a company is,

255
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,919
the more enemies you'll have.

256
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,000
Only if strong companies form an alliance...

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,600
can we withstand the risk in the market together.

258
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,559
A marriage alliance is the best way to do that.

259
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,080
I hope you can understand this.

260
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,679
Although Hou Jue doesn't understand my thoughts right now,

261
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,960
people eventually grow up, right?

262
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
Mr. Hou Junior.

263
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,279
Can you hear them like that?

264
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,039
Someday,

265
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,879
he'll understand that I'm doing this for his own good.

266
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,919
Also, Shi Yi,

267
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,559
I don't care if Fang Lu doesn't like you.

268
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,360
But if Chen Chen is bothered by you,

269
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,759
I have to take it seriously.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's because you need to be clear about one thing.

271
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,200
Chen Chen is the future wife...

272
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,679
that I've chosen for Hou Jue.

273
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,399
Then what do you want me to do, Mr. Hou?

274
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,279
I want you to leave.

275
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,200
Mr. Hou.

276
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,480
What does this have to do with Shi Yi?

277
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Why are you making her go?

278
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,840
It's none of your business. Leave.

279
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,879
Can't you see that I'm talking to Shi Yi right now?

280
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,759
She is my bodyguard.

281
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,399
Why can't I listen to a conversation related to her?

282
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,679
Shi Yi, go out first.

283
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,240
Let me talk to Hou Jue for a bit.

284
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,799
Okay.

285
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,200
Go ahead and talk.

286
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,240
Why are you asking Shi Yi to leave?

287
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm clearing the obstacles for you.

288
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,039
What obstacles do I have?

289
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm clearing the obstacles between you and Chen Chen.

290
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,480
Can't you see that?

291
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
As long as Wu Shi Yi is around,

292
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,679
all girls will misunderstand.

293
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,840
I didn't think about this...

294
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,200
when I asked Shi Yi to be your bodyguard back then.

295
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,120
The obstacle between me and Chen Chen...

296
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,080
has nothing to do with Shi Yi.

297
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,320
The obstacle between us is Chen Chen herself.

298
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,559
Okay?

299
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,159
In other words, she's too much of a drama queen.

300
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,320
She's too much for me.

301
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,120
How are you going to fix that?

302
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
That's not for me to fix.

303
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,399
Time will do the job.

304
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
Once you get married...

305
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,639
and have a couple of kids in a few years,

306
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,960
by then, you'll have grown older...

307
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,440
and be more mature.

308
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,399
Everything will be fine then, right?

309
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,159
Being of equal social status is the most important.

310
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,399
Do you understand?

311
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,279
It is important, but what does that have to do with Shi Yi?

312
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,600
Why are you making her leave?

313
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not my request.

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,519
It's Chen Chen's request.

315
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,120
Chen Chen's request?

316
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,639
Who is she to make any demands?

317
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,279
What rights does she have to make requests?

318
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,759
If it weren't for her,

319
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,519
would things have ended up like that yesterday?

320
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,919
She doesn't respect other people's jobs.

321
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,360
She embarrassed herself.

322
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,679
Whose fault is it?

323
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,720
Some people might like a girl like Chen Chen,

324
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,759
but that's definitely not me.

325
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,759
It's impossible between us.

326
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,319
Hou Jue.

327
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,920
I'll be having Mr. Sheng and Chen Chen over...

328
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,960
at the clubhouse tomorrow.

329
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,839
If you've made up your mind not to dismiss Shi Yi,

330
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,039
but at the same time, you also don't want to be with Chen Chen,

331
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,799
figure it out yourself.

332
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,410
Think of a way...

333
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,599
that can ease your relationship with Chen Chen.

334
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,119
Do you understand?

335
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,680
This isn't only what Chen Chen wants.

336
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,170
Mr. Sheng's company is very important to us.

337
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,759
I'm sure I don't have to tell you this.

338
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,519
You should know this very well.

339
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,519
It's unnecessary for things to turn out like this.

340
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,599
Sure.

341
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,119
Arrange a dinner then.

342
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,319
It'll give you the chance to see Chen Chen's disgusting behavior.

343
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,480
I'll pack up and leave right away.

344
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
I won't trouble you.

345
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,839
You wish.

346
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,000
Do you want to leave after causing me trouble?

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,559
Don't even think about it.

348
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,039
Just be good and stay here, okay?

349
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I need to see you. Now.

350
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,359
(Delete)

351
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,039
I'll be back.

352
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,279
Tian Min.

353
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,890
What's so urgent that requires you to tell me now?

354
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,319
What did you do again?

355
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,680
I didn't do anything.

356
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,599
Someone transferred out 20 million from our account.

357
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,410
You...

358
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,680
You've been hacked.

359
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,839
How are you still in the mood to joke around?

360
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,039
What's going on?

361
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,170
What exactly happened?

362
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,519
Let me tell you.

363
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm afraid it won't be safe to keep the money here,

364
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,839
so I transferred the money to a friend who's abroad.

365
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,359
I asked him to help us buy a house.

366
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,410
Didn't you say you want to leave?

367
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,039
I have to arrange things for us.

368
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,599
Just relax.

369
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,200
Didn't we agree on this back then?

370
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,079
We're just giving Hou Zhi Rong a scare.

371
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,079
When Hou Jue leaves,

372
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,519
- we'll return the money. - Yes.

373
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,720
You used the money to buy a house.

374
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,799
How are we going to pay Hou Zhi Rong back?

375
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,039
Ma Yong, hurry up and transfer the money back.

376
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,650
Let's hurry and pay the company back.

377
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,680
All right. Don't worry.

378
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,410
Just stay out of this.

379
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,119
Ma Yong.

380
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,480
I hacked the neighborhood's property management company...

381
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,440
and the Zhirong website...

382
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,799
to take revenge for you.

383
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,599
Hou Jue didn't bring any actual losses...

384
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,650
to the neighborhood and Zhirong Construction.

385
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,799
But...

386
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,119
But you've gone too far.

387
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
What if the police find out? What will we do?

388
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,720
I'll just go to jail then.

389
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,890
Tian Min.

390
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,410
You know this.

391
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,359
I started working here as soon as I graduated from college.

392
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,890
I ran errands and served as Hou Zhi Rong's assistant.

393
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,119
I had to endure it for so many years to get to where I am now.

394
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,920
I eluded so much risk...

395
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,359
and created so much value for him.

396
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,480
I acted like a fool to show my loyalty.

397
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,890
I even refused a higher salary.

398
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,920
Did he ever give me an extra penny?

399
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,039
No.

400
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,170
All he does is suck me dry.

401
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,240
So what if I took 20 million from him?

402
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,119
Hou Zhi Rong owes me this money!

403
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,839
I know.

404
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,880
You're saying that Hou Zhi Rong has been using you.

405
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,559
He didn't keep his promise.

406
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,720
But since you don't trust him,

407
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,240
we can leave.

408
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,759
Why should I leave?

409
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,079
He promised to make me the company's successor.

410
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,119
You know that.

411
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,599
He told the whole company...

412
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,359
that I'm closer to him than his own son.

413
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,079
The company needs me.

414
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,119
I was an idiot. I believed it. I believed everything he said.

415
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,720
That's why I always put the company's interests...

416
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,119
and his interests first.

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,240
That day,

418
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
in front of the hospital room,

419
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,079
I heard him tell Hou Jue,

420
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,279
"Ma Yong works conscientiously and diligently."

421
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,359
"But he's an outsider."

422
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,920
"Outsiders have other intentions."

423
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,920
"Outsiders have other intentions,"

424
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,279
"so we have to be careful of them."

425
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,359
I worked hard for 13 years.

426
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But these honest words are what I get.

427
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,640
His so-called affection...

428
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,559
is just for using people.

429
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,440
You're going to regret this.

430
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,519
You're committing a crime. We can't escape.

431
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,759
I just want you...

432
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,680
to be happy...

433
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,279
and safe every day.

434
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,880
I don't want you to go to jail.

435
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,559
Ms. Zhang.

436
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,359
Where did you go on the weekend?

437
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,720
The photos you posted are so beautiful.

438
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,039
It was a resort.

439
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,519
My future son-in-law runs it.

440
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Your son-in-law is very capable.

441
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,480
The hotel is beautiful and it's by the ocean.

442
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,359
It's okay.

443
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,720
It just opened.

444
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,519
If you want to go,

445
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,960
I have a VIP card.

446
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,319
You can get a discount.

447
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
Your son-in-law...

448
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,240
is so thoughtful and capable.

449
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,359
That's hard to come by.

450
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:30,720
You're jealous, right?

451
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,039
I'm so jealous.

452
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,240
- Hurry and read the documents. - All right.

453
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,359
Do you think she'll like this purse?

454
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,519
I think so.

455
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,640
It's so expensive.

456
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,519
Isn't he that guy?

457
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,119
It's your old acquaintance.

458
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,759
Lan Qi.

459
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,079
Shi Yi.

460
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,000
Mr. Hou Junior.

461
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:06,079
Mr. Lan, are you shopping with your girlfriend?

462
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,799
- Where is she? - Lan Qi, look at my outfit.

463
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,480
- Lan Qi. - Mom?

464
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,200
This is such a nice outfit.

465
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,480
Dad.

466
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,400
Shi Yi.

467
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,920
What's going on?

468
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,680
Well, it's your mom's birthday this Saturday, right?

469
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,480
I told them I would buy them new outfits to cheer them up.

470
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
Is it your birthday?

471
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,279
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

472
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
Ma'am, which outfit do you want? I'll buy it for you.

473
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,359
You like the one you're wearing, right?

474
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,400
What other stores are there nearby?

475
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,519
Let's go and take a look. Let's go, ma'am.

476
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,880
- No, you really don't have to. - That's enough.

477
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
I already said I don't want to celebrate it.

478
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,960
But Lan Qi said he has a gift card...

479
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
and that it will expire if he doesn't use it.

480
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,480
Yes, it would be a shame not to use it.

481
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,839
Don't bother using a gift card.

482
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,960
You don't need to feel bad for my wallet.

483
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,680
- Let's go, ma'am. Come on. - There's really no need.

484
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,160
What are you guys doing?

485
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,960
- He came to buy... - I just took Shi Yi shopping.

486
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,440
We just bought a purse.

487
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,519
Something urgent came up.

488
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,480
I'll get going now, ma'am and Mr. Wu.

489
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,160
- All right. - Let's go.

490
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,599
- I'm leaving then. - Shi Yi.

491
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,400
- Thank you. - No problem.

492
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm leaving.

493
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,960
You...

494
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,720
The conversation was going well. Why did you keep trying to explain?

495
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,039
Why do you always ruin things for me?

496
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,119
What did I do?

497
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,319
You didn't even let me talk.

498
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,480
You're the one to talk.

499
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,640
What nonsense were you saying just now?

500
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,799
Anyhow, you're not allowed to explain to them.

501
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,039
Who are you to tell me what to do?

502
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,160
What do you mean?

503
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,640
Who does he think he is?

504
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
He's trying to get in with your parents...

505
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,920
while I'm not looking.

506
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,839
I hate people like that. He's so cunning.

507
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,359
You need to stay away from this kind of person.

508
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,640
He already knew my parents very well over 10 years ago.

509
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,920
So what? Can he do this just because he knows them well?

510
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,720
He pretends not to do anything, but he's secretly making moves.

511
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,359
What kind of behavior is that?

512
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,839
How can he do that?

513
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,160
Say something.

514
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,720
Why are you looking at me?

515
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,359
What kind of behavior is that?

516
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
What's wrong, Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wu?

517
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,799
If you think...

518
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm bothered by Mr. Hou giving Shi Yi a gift,

519
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,839
then you're overthinking it.

520
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,119
That purse is really expensive.

521
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,359
From what I know about Shi Yi,

522
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,880
she would never accept it.

523
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
- That's right. - That's for sure.

524
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,039
Besides, we're different.

525
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,279
When I met Shi Yi,

526
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,480
she was still in elementary school, right?

527
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Yes.

528
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,039
She has always had many pursuers ever since she was young.

529
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,440
I'm used to it now.

530
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
That's right.

531
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,720
But Shi Yi is very faithful.

532
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,559
Mr. Wu and Ms. Zhang.

533
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,839
My parents passed away early.

534
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,200
So...

535
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,119
deep down,

536
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,599
I've always thought of you two...

537
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,279
as my parents.

538
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,160
Shi Yi is busy.

539
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,079
I'll take care of you on her behalf.

540
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,480
Lan Qi.

541
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,400
Hearing you say that, I feel...

542
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,000
You're a good kid.

543
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,880
All right, let's go eat.

544
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay.

545
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,440
Lan Qi said that purse is quite expensive.

546
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,279
If Shi Yi doesn't accept it, it'll be such a waste.

547
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,599
She can give it to me.

548
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,960
It could sell for a lot of money on secondhand shopping websites.

549
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,119
How cheap.

550
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,400
Look at you.

551
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
I was just kidding, but you took it seriously.

552
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,000
You're so old now,

553
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,319
yet you still have no sense of humor.

554
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,440
Whatever.

555
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,160
I'm just wondering...

556
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,039
what stage he and Shi Yi are at now.

557
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,480
Why don't you send her a message and ask?

558
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,519
There's no point in asking.

559
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,839
She'll definitely say they're just working together.

560
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
But I saw Hou Jue's eyes.

561
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,160
He can't fool me.

562
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,079
If Shi Yi has really fallen in love with Hou Jue,

563
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,240
what should we do then?

564
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,480
What about Lan Qi?

565
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,079
That would be a good thing.

566
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
Both of them can pursue her at the same time.

567
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,599
If there's a rival,

568
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,039
they'll both care about Shi Yi even more.

569
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,640
Moreover, Shi Yi will understand her own value even better.

570
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
That's right.

571
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,920
In terms of competitive mechanisms,

572
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,480
you're an expert.

573
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,279
Back then, I also had to fight my way through a rain of bullets...

574
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,440
and a bloodbath.

575
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,079
Why did I marry you?

576
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,799
Why did you follow me here?

577
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
Aren't you going to take me home?

578
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,880
Who said I would do that?

579
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,759
Your place is so close. Walk home by yourself.

580
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,240
I have a date.

581
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,079
Isn't this a competitive mechanism?

582
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,599
Give me your parents' phone numbers.

583
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,839
Why?

584
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,000
You're with me every day, right?

585
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,519
You risk your life for me, right?

586
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,279
If anything happens to you,

587
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,720
as your boss,

588
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,920
I have to tell your parents right away.

589
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,799
It's okay.

590
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,599
If anything happens to me, you can notify our company.

591
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,160
They'll notify my parents.

592
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,240
A notification from your company is one thing.

593
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,319
Right? It's completely different if it comes from me.

594
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,119
I have to tell your parents directly.

595
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,599
That shows sincerity.

596
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,960
- People... - That's enough.

597
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,960
Stop thinking about these useless things.

598
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,119
Hurry and think about how to apologize to Chen Chen...

599
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,799
when you get to the restaurant later.

600
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,720
Why should I apologize? I'm not apologizing.

601
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm asking for phone numbers right now.

602
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,799
I'll develop a good relationship with your parents first.

603
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,160
That way,

604
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,440
this can slowly develop as normal...

605
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,000
You're not getting their numbers.

606
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,240
Has that Little Qi of yours...

607
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
not contacted you yet?

608
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,720
No.

609
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,680
He hasn't done anything at all.

610
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,519
This guy is strange.

611
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,960
Is he that calm?

612
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,119
He's deep.

613
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,359
That's true.

614
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,519
Anyone is deeper than you.

615
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,480
All right.

616
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,279
I'll wait for you here.

617
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,519
Go in.

618
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,839
Remember.

619
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,079
Be patient.

620
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,880
Think about the bigger picture.

621
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,680
I hope Ms. Chen...

622
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,279
can bring her best today.

623
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,400
Open my dad's eyes...

624
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,160
and let him witness her evilness.

625
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,680
I'm going.

626
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
Good luck.

627
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,279
Dad.

628
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,640
Mr. Chen.

629
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,960
Why are you so late?

630
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,079
Look at the time.

631
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,680
What time did I tell you to come?

632
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,599
Hurry up and apologize to Chen Chen.

633
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,440
An apology isn't enough.

634
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,079
I went to buy a purse.

635
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,519
Ms. Chen, please accept it. Here.

636
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,839
Look at this.

637
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,359
He's a smart one.

638
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,880
Accept it. See if it's nice.

639
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
If you don't like it,

640
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,599
I'll ask my son to buy you a new one.

641
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,960
I'll go right away.

642
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,000
It's all right.

643
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,920
Okay, come on.

644
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,640
Son, pick up your glass.

645
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,440
- Here, Mr. Sheng. - Okay.

646
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,200
On behalf of my son,

647
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,119
I apologize to you and Chen Chen.

648
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,160
It's nothing.

649
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,880
My son doesn't know any better.

650
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,759
Please forgive him.

651
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,000
What did I do wrong?

652
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,440
You upset her.

653
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,119
It's a man's crime.

654
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,960
Do you understand?

655
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,799
Then I've committed a deadly crime.

656
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,640
I apologize.

657
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,039
- Come on. - I'll apologize to you too.

658
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,119
Thank you.

659
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,000
That's right.

660
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,799
Zhi Rong.

661
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,759
Thank you so much.

662
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,039
You had to personally take care...

663
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,119
of a trivial matter like this for our kids.

664
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,680
Mr. Sheng, you're treating me as an outsider by saying that.

665
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,640
Kids are still young and reckless.

666
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,079
It's understandable that they have bad tempers.

667
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,400
In fact, having quarrels will bring them closer together.

668
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,440
Don't you remember the times when we were young?

669
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,720
Didn't we also bicker and argue?

670
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,599
That's right.

671
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,079
Chen Chen.

672
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,400
Back then, when Zhi Rong and I worked together,

673
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,559
we didn't trust each other at all.

674
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:19,000
We really had a lot of arguments.

675
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,599
Yes, I'm telling you.

676
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,599
When your grandpa stepped down and I joined the company,

677
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,639
I was still young.

678
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,159
I didn't know anything.

679
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,920
It was Mr. Sheng who helped me out a lot...

680
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,239
at the most important stage of my life.

681
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,440
We often slammed tables and threw wine glasses...

682
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,639
because of business conflicts.

683
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,880
We've done everything.

684
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,000
- Isn't that right, Mr. Sheng? - Yes.

685
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,119
But look at us now.

686
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,679
We're fine.

687
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,289
If fate brings two people together,

688
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:46,519
you should treasure this relationship.

689
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,769
Mr. Sheng and I both have faith in you two.

690
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,599
All right.

691
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,000
Hou Jue, did your female lackey resign from her post yet?

692
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,239
No.

693
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,639
Little brat.

694
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,119
That's enough. It's in the past now.

695
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,000
There's no need to set yourself against a little girl.

696
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That's right.

697
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
Dad, I'm not setting myself against her.

698
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,960
She's just a little lackey. She's not worth my time.

699
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,840
I just want her to leave.

700
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,960
This...

701
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,880
Chen Chen.

702
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:14,920
Listen to me.

703
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,119
That girl really can't leave.

704
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,920
I especially hired that girl from a security company...

705
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,769
to protect my son.

706
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,559
She used to be an athlete.

707
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,679
She had won championships and medals.

708
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:27,519
Her working ability is definitely top-notch.

709
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,329
With her by my son's side...

710
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,400
Mr. Sheng, you also know this.

711
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,719
I only have one son.

712
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,519
I'll feel a lot more at ease.

713
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,639
That's true.

714
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,000
Right?

715
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:38,809
No wonder she's so fierce.

716
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,039
That's more the reason she has to leave.

717
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,809
All right.

718
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,289
But she didn't do anything wrong.

719
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,639
Why does she have to leave?

720
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,480
How was she not wrong?

721
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,960
She bullied me. I hate her! Is that not good enough of a reason?

722
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:59,289
Chen Chen. That is good enough.

723
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:00,880
How about this?

724
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,440
I'll make sure you're happy today.

725
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,559
Let's do this.

726
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,199
Ask Shi Yi to come in here.

727
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,920
She should apologize to Chen Chen.

728
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,719
What do you think, Mr. Sheng?

729
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,769
That's a good idea.

730
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:13,880
Just call her here.

731
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,119
Once they meet and talk things out,

732
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,239
everything will be resolved, right?

733
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,960
- Okay. - Go on.

734
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,329
I can't go.

735
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,880
Are you going or not?

736
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,329
As long as you're all happy.

737
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:30,840
As long as you're all happy.

738
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,769
Why did you come out?

739
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,159
Well...

740
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,329
You need to go in and apologize to Chen Chen.

741
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm doing this out of respect for my dad.

742
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,559
Chen Chen just won't let it go no matter what we say.

743
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,559
Let's just apologize.

744
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,039
There's no need to say more.

745
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,519
Okay.

746
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,440
What should I say then?

747
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,559
Just say...

748
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,239
Just say, "I'm sorry."

749
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,289
That's it.

750
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,960
Okay?

751
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,639
Let's go.

752
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,440
Has he still not contacted you yet?

753
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,559
Who?

754
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,920
Little Qi.

755
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,000
No.

756
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,039
Did he not believe it?

757
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,719
Have I met my match?

758
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,809
Are you going in or not?

759
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,079
Let's go.

760
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,360
Thank you. Come on.

761
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,639
Dad. Mr. Chen.

762
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,159
Hou Jue. Shi Yi.

763
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,960
Mr. Sheng, this is Shi Yi.

764
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,809
Chen Chen, Shi Yi is here now.

765
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:55,119
You two have a good talk.

766
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,440
Hello, everyone.

767
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,079
Hello, Ms. Chen.

768
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,119
Heroine, we meet again.

769
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,119
Hello, Ms. Chen.

770
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,289
If I did anything wrong before...

771
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,840
and make you angry,

772
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,159
please forgive me.

773
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm sorry.

774
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,880
She apologized.

775
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
I've waited for this moment for an eternity.

776
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,480
All right. Tell me. What did you do wrong?

777
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,960
Brat, that's enough.

778
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,639
No.

779
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,960
Whatever it is you think I did wrong,

780
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,599
then that's what it is.

781
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,239
I want to ask you.

782
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,480
That day,

783
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,000
did you purposely embarrass me?

784
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,000
I didn't.

785
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,239
Yes, you did.

786
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,400
Is this the right attitude to apologize?

787
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,119
Chen Chen.

788
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,679
She already apologized.

789
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,960
Why are you still getting hung up on the details?

790
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:57,400
Sit down.

791
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,079
Forget it.

792
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,809
Since Hou Jue gave me a gift,

793
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,159
I won't ask about that.

794
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,840
How about this?

795
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,809
Drink this up.

796
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,400
Then we can be good friends.

797
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,769
Ms. Chen.

798
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,480
Thank you for your kindness,

799
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,079
but I can't drink alcohol.

800
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,920
That's our rule.

801
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:29,360
I decide what your rule is.

802
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,840
- I told you to drink it. - She really can't drink.

803
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,289
There's a policy in their industry.

804
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,440
They can't drink when they're on duty.

805
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,119
If you're really angry,

806
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,480
then how about this?

807
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,289
You can't be friends anyway.

808
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:41,440
I'll drink it for you.

809
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
No.

810
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,840
What are you doing?

811
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,519
Who is she to you? Who are you to drink for her?

812
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,809
Your apology...

813
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:03,639
isn't sincere at all.

814
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,519
I've finished the drink.

815
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,719
Stop dragging this out now.

816
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,000
Fine.

817
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,559
I won't drag this out.

818
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,719
All right.

819
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,440
Drink this up.

820
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,559
I'll let this pass if you drink this.

821
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,400
I really can't drink.

822
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:27,000
Chen Chen.

823
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,400
This is the rule of her profession.

824
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,480
It's their policy, right?

825
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,289
We should at least respect her occupation.

826
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,199
What do you mean?

827
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,920
Is her career more important or am I more important?

828
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:44,079
Who do you think you are?

829
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:47,079
I'm telling you. I can make you lose your job anytime.

830
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,880
You're just a lackey.

831
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,679
You're just a human shield.

832
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,840
You're just a guard dog!

833
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,559
Don't insult my profession.

834
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
That's exactly what I'm doing!

835
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,239
Chen Chen, what are you doing?

836
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,329
Get lost!

837
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,440
That's enough.

838
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,400
Apologize for what you said.

839
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:09,769
I won't apologize.

840
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:10,880
Apologize.

841
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,000
I won't.

842
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,119
Zhi Rong.

843
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,769
Shi Yi, that's enough.

844
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,289
Dad, you saw it too.

845
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,400
This is the situation.

846
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,920
We've already come to apologize.

847
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,079
The rest is none of our business.

848
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,199
Let's go.

849
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,840
Let's go.

850
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,199
Hou Jue.

851
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,519
Come back here.

852
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Hou Jue!

853
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,360
I told you to come back here!

854
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,960
Die!

855
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,599
Chen Chen!
