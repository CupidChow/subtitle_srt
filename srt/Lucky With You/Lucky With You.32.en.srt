(A project funded by Zhejiang Cultural Art Development Foundation)

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
(Directed by Liu Xue Song)

3
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,159
(Episode 32)

4
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
There's nothing between us.

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
It's a one-sided love.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,120
I'm pursuing her.

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,519
But you stole her away.

8
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm okay...

9
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,959
with you stealing her away.

10
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,200
Because you can give her a lot of things that I can't.

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,439
You can make her happy.

12
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,519
But you didn't make her happy and only made her feel worse.

13
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,879
She's such a good girl! You old womanizer!

14
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,040
Why are you such a jerk?

15
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,200
Aren't you ashamed?

16
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,959
Hai Xing.

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,840
Qian Qian?

18
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,530
Let go, you two.

19
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,599
Let go!

20
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,039
I didn't think you were capable of this.

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,159
I'm so disappointed in you.

22
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,439
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,719
I...

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
But I just...

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,479
This is a matter of cardinal importance.

26
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,800
No buts.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,840
Qian Qian.

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,439
I don't know you.

29
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,199
I scolded him...

30
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,639
because he's my friend.

31
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,719
He is a friend for life.

32
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,120
About that,

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,719
he made a mistake.

34
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,000
We'll figure out a way to fix this.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,159
You go ahead.

36
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,520
Qian Qian, listen to me.

37
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
Qian Qian.

38
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,400
I had no idea.

39
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,199
I really didn't expect things to turn out this way.

40
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,170
I mean it.

41
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,839
Hai Xing was right.

42
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,639
I have let you down.

43
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,839
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,730
Hai Xing.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,879
I'm sorry. I was a bit impulsive.

46
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,399
Let's start again...

47
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,240
with a clean slate.

48
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,920
Mr. Hou.

49
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,639
I always thought...

50
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,360
you were diligent but a little silly.

51
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,279
I didn't expect you to pick up mean tricks so quickly.

52
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,480
You stole your friend's proposal.

53
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
Now, you use your friend's proposal...

54
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,079
to blackmail his dad.

55
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,920
If your friend knew,

56
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,319
what would he think?

57
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm sure he won't see me as a friend anymore.

58
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,040
I was in a dilemma.

59
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,199
But I'm sure it won't affect Monkey.

60
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,160
And I've always wanted to make it up to him.

61
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Fine, that's just an excuse.

62
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,759
I...

63
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,879
I did it and it was wrong.

64
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,000
Do you think you're a kid?

65
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,959
Do you think you can get over with it just by apologizing?

66
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
This is theft.

67
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,079
The value of the project is not evaluated now.

68
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,839
If the amount exceeds a million yuan,

69
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,040
that's a huge amount.

70
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,600
You will be sentenced to 10 years in prison.

71
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
Even forever.

72
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,519
I know that.

73
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,079
I looked it up on my end.

74
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,160
But I don't regret it.

75
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,680
You...

76
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,000
You were so upset because of Hou Zhi Rong.

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,279
I couldn't bear to see you suffer.

78
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,560
If I don't do anything,

79
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,639
I can't.

80
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,160
I have to do something.

81
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,600
Right?

82
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,240
Do you think by doing so,

83
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,600
I will be with you?

84
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,519
Exactly.

85
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,759
Through this incident, I realized...

86
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,279
As you said,

87
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,560
the two of us belong to two different worlds.

88
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm like a star in the ocean.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,399
You're a star in the sky.

90
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,000
I can only admire you from afar.

91
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,199
No matter how hard I try,

92
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,800
I can't reach you for sure.

93
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,559
Hai Xing.

94
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,210
Everything you did to me, I...

95
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm actually quite moved.

96
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,159
But that's not love.

97
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,799
If we ended up together merely because I was moved,

98
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,919
I would hold you back.

99
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,039
That's enough.

100
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,679
I have no regrets. I've given up.

101
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,399
Just now,

102
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,519
from the way Hou Zhi Rong looked at you,

103
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,210
I could tell...

104
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,720
that he loves you.

105
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,120
And he should have learned that he's wrong.

106
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,039
I feel so much better now that I've told you.

107
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,519
You know what?

108
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,720
In the beginning, I always had nightmares.

109
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,600
I didn't know what to do with the money.

110
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,210
I couldn't even sleep.

111
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,720
That's great.

112
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,720
Where is the money?

113
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,279
Where is it?

114
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,240
I spent it.

115
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,159
You spent it?

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,159
Don't worry.

117
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,000
We'll protect you.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,210
I'm going to have the Legal Department handle it.

119
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,559
The legal team will contact Zhang Sheng.

120
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,039
When the time comes, we'll sue him...

121
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,159
and get our money back.

122
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,210
Don't worry about that.

123
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
Even if you don't sue him,

124
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,840
I will sue him.

125
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,279
Hou Jue, I have a question.

126
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,600
In your design,

127
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,679
it is hidden there an Arab figure of 511.

128
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,279
Do you want to explain?

129
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,210
You have sharp eyes.

130
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,159
I don't think I need to explain it.

131
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,919
It might be proof...

132
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,559
that you're the one who came up with the idea.

133
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,519
Wu Shi Yi...

134
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,159
is a girl's name.

135
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
I included a small thought...

136
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,399
in the design.

137
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,720
That's a girl's name? Are you serious?

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,039
That's right.

139
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,519
Let me show you.

140
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,639
Wu Shi Yi.

141
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,360
(Profile of the Security Team)

142
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
(Wu Shi Yi)

143
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,639
She is a female bodyguard.

144
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,000
Tell me the story.

145
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,519
There's nothing to say.

146
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,679
Let's put it this way.

147
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,840
Have you seen my company?

148
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,399
I have hidden...

149
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,399
the name of the girl I like here.

150
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,840
- Is that so? - Yes.

151
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,039
How about this?

152
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,080
Here.

153
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,639
Let's exchange. What do you think?

154
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,159
But I don't want to know yours.

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,039
Fine.

156
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,159
Let's talk business.

157
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,200
We...

158
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,639
We're in the middle of a tender right now.

159
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,919
I desperately need a designer like you.

160
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,399
More importantly, I'm a busybody.

161
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,639
I'm interested in your story.

162
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,679
I want to hear it.

163
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,320
So Hou Jue,

164
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
how would you feel about joining Hedgehog Factory?

165
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,279
Mr. Xiao, I really appreciate your invitation.

166
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,639
And I'm more than willing.

167
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,320
I'm telling you.

168
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,360
This is how we welcome new talent.

169
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,039
Fine.

170
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm telling you the truth.

171
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,480
This is a design for a six-star foreign hotel.

172
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,679
As the other company withdrew,

173
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,679
we got a last-minute replacement offer.

174
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,679
It's an honor.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm doing my best.

176
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,799
Welcome.

177
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,159
Cool.

178
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,840
Here, two copies.

179
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,559
One for you, one for me.

180
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
You can be at ease now.

181
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,320
I told you that I'm going to let it slide.

182
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,000
Thank you.

183
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,759
Thank you for forgiving him.

184
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,759
I do this...

185
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,840
for my peace of mind too.

186
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,840
He has already spent...

187
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,200
the money he made from selling the design.

188
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,240
He bought equipment for the rescue team.

189
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,840
He felt uneasy when he had the money.

190
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,919
That's great.

191
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,000
At least I did a good thing.

192
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,039
That won't change the nature of that money.

193
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,799
What's wrong is wrong.

194
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,159
Don't take it so seriously.

195
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,840
It's a matter of principle. I have to take it seriously.

196
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,039
I'll get going then.

197
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,000
Bye.

198
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,240
Take care of yourself.

199
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Hello.

200
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,000
Hello.

201
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,840
Are you Zhang Ying Nan?

202
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,200
Yes, I am.

203
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,519
An old man is drunk in our neighborhood.

204
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,639
He claims that he is your husband.

205
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,799
Can you come and pick him up?

206
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,600
I got it.

207
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,320
Text me the address.

208
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
How useless.

209
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,000
Slow down.

210
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,720
Watch out for the staircases. Lift your leg.

211
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,200
Is Mr. Wu all right?

212
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
It's fine. Thank you.

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Did you sprain your ankle?

214
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,720
Open the door!

215
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,519
The door is over there.

216
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,240
Come on.

217
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,200
Let go.

218
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,279
What happened? How did you hurt your leg?

219
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,200
Li He Lin was merciless!

220
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,840
Li He Lin?

221
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,960
Did Li He Lin hit you?

222
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,359
I hit Li He Lin.

223
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,200
Who told you to fight?

224
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,559
It's because of your mom.

225
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,720
Don't look down at your mom.

226
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,039
Once, luxury cars followed her from behind.

227
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,279
They kept calling her Ms. Zhang.

228
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,599
But the truth is, your mom is really mindless.

229
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,890
She's the most gullible little girl.

230
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,319
If I didn't protect her,

231
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,000
she'd have already fallen for it.

232
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,519
Look at you.

233
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,119
Who can you protect?

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,759
Don't let your mom...

235
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,359
be bullied by anyone.

236
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,720
Sleep.

237
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,890
Okay.

238
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,680
That's all...

239
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,759
for my latest proposal.

240
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,890
I look forward to hearing your comments.

241
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,559
I need to digest...

242
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,720
this latest proposal of yours.

243
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,319
It's much better than the previous draft.

244
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,410
It's more groundbreaking.

245
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,599
That's what I think too.

246
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,599
I think it still lacks soul.

247
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,720
But it is for sure better than before.

248
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,170
This proposal...

249
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,890
is not perfect.

250
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,279
There is some room for improvement.

251
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,890
However, since it was produced in such a short time,

252
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,440
I think it's totally acceptable.

253
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,039
Even if the original design has been leaked and plagiarized,

254
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,119
it doesn't matter.

255
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,519
Bao Xiao Han.

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,480
I was right about you.

257
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,000
Next,

258
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,000
we have to introduce the project...

259
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
related to this proposal.

260
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,519
Okay.

261
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,599
Meeting is adjourned.

262
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:47,480
Li, I want some cilantro.

263
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,650
Sure.

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Is this enough?

265
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,170
That's enough.

266
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,440
It's five yuan.

267
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,240
You're badly injured.

268
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,359
Why didn't you order food?

269
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,650
I take it as a form of exercise.

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,279
Wu Tian Yi.

271
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,039
Wu Tian Yi.

272
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,519
Hello, the number you have dialed...

273
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,519
He's not picking up.

274
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,240
Ying Nan.

275
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,279
Why are you here?

276
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,119
You're crippled, yet you don't stay at home.

277
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,200
Where did you go?

278
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
- I went to the market. - Why didn't you answer the phone?

279
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,599
I forgot about it.

280
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,039
Give it to me.

281
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,079
Let's go.

282
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,839
The food is ready.

283
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,599
Let's eat.

284
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,480
That's nice.

285
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,440
It's good.

286
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,650
What's wrong?

287
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,759
Listen, from today onward,

288
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,720
you can't drink anymore,

289
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
especially when I am around.

290
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't drink that wine anymore?

291
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,039
What about this?

292
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,720
You are really a hopeless drunkard.

293
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,079
If I keep worrying about you, I'll...

294
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,319
Where are you going?

295
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,839
I don't want to see a drunkard like you again.

296
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,519
I'm just kidding.

297
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,000
I drink because of you.

298
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,960
Okay, since you care about me,

299
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,920
I'll make a statement.

300
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,759
Fine, I quit drinking.

301
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,680
Come on.

302
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,920
Have a seat.

303
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,799
Eat up.

304
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
Is that all? Can you really do that?

305
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,839
For you, I can quit anything.

306
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,519
Also,

307
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,279
you're always getting into fights.

308
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,519
You have to quit fighting too.

309
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,799
It depends.

310
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,440
If it's Li He Lin,

311
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,519
I have to beat him up.

312
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,960
You've been trying to be a hero all this time...

313
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
and you get hurt all over.

314
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,039
Is it worth it?

315
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
I'm doing this for you.

316
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,440
I don't want you to be bullied.

317
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,200
Thank you, but no thank you.

318
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,720
Ying Nan.

319
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,119
Tell me the truth.

320
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,039
Did Li He Lin...

321
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
do anything to you?

322
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
Fine, I'll tell you.

323
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,480
Li He Lin and I are a thing now.

324
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,400
We're getting married in a flash.

325
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Are you happy now?

326
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,000
No, my heart hurts.

327
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,240
Keep going.

328
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,519
Come in.

329
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,400
Mr. Hou, Bao Xiao Han is here to see you.

330
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,839
Bao Xiao Han?

331
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,440
Xiao Han.

332
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,519
- Come in. - Mr. Hou.

333
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,000
Let me look at you.

334
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,200
You look so pale.

335
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
Did you work for the whole night again?

336
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,079
You did a great job.

337
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,119
- Here, have a seat. - Okay.

338
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,640
My friend gave me some good tea again.

339
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,759
Come on.

340
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,400
- Here, have some tea. - Mr. Hou.

341
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,160
I'll pass on the tea.

342
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,839
But...

343
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,559
- I... - What's wrong?

344
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,680
I came to tell you something.

345
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,160
Just say it.

346
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,400
Why are you hesitating?

347
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,519
Tell me.

348
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,160
- I'll get straight to the point. - Okay, tell me.

349
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,440
Mr. Hou, look.

350
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,359
The new design...

351
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,519
is confirmed.

352
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,680
That means...

353
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,839
our project is coming to an end, right?

354
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,640
So our contract...

355
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,279
Contract?

356
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,079
What contract?

357
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,200
You must have forgotten it because you are too busy.

358
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,680
On that day,

359
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,559
you told me to wait for you to come back.

360
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,839
I was sitting here.

361
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,960
You sat in the same spot when you were back.

362
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,680
Xiao Han, if you ask me,

363
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,839
as a designer,

364
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,079
you have to keep...

365
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,880
your mind pure.

366
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,920
If you only care...

367
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,960
about fame and interests,

368
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,160
it's not good.

369
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,279
Wait, Mr. Hou. Am I not pure?

370
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,519
But didn't you agree to it?

371
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,480
We've talked about this, right?

372
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,279
Did I agree?

373
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,519
Yes, you were drunk that day.

374
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,680
Do you mean the night we drank together?

375
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,240
I think I drank too much that night.

376
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,079
I can't recall what I said.

377
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,319
I remember now.

378
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,079
- You told me that the other day. - That's right.

379
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,720
But I said I would consider it.

380
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Am I right?

381
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,359
Didn't I tell you I would consider?

382
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Xiao Han.

383
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,160
Don't rush into something like this.

384
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,960
Do you know there are hundreds of people in the company?

385
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,000
If I only focus...

386
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,799
on your personal gain and loss,

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,799
what about the others in the company?

388
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,839
Am I right?

389
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,799
It's all good when everyone is doing good.

390
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,960
Let's put a stop...

391
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,799
to the conversation.

392
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,839
Get back to work.

393
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:35,440
I'll take care of the rest for you.

394
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,240
Go, Xiao Han.

395
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,599
Mr. Hou.

396
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,000
You asked me to join the company.

397
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,920
When I quit,

398
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
you brought me back here...

399
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,359
to participate in a new project.

400
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,960
When...

401
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,519
In short,

402
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,200
when you needed me the most,

403
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,359
you gave me more than one promise.

404
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
But every time I tried to come up with a plan...

405
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
and when it's done,

406
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,160
you forgot your promises.

407
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,160
Mr. Hou.

408
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,279
What's the matter with you?

409
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,359
Xiao Han.

410
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,920
How can you say that?

411
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,559
I really don't like to hear that.

412
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,759
It's so not pleasant to the ears.

413
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,359
It's true.

414
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,680
At work, I, Hou Zhi Rong,

415
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,519
always think from the company's perspective.

416
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm doing it for everyone.

417
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,279
But you're sitting here...

418
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,160
listing down your personal interest one by one.

419
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,519
That's selfish.

420
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,640
Initially, you left me...

421
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
with a wonderful impression.

422
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,880
After listening to you,

423
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,319
why do I feel...

424
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,160
that your image is no longer wonderful?

425
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,440
What a coincidence, Mr. Hou.

426
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,720
I've always respected you.

427
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,400
But now, to me, your image...

428
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:49,960
is not that wonderful either.

429
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,559
In that case,

430
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,079
I think...

431
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,480
I'd better disappear before your eyes.

432
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,960
Xiao Han.

433
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,920
Do you want to quit again?

434
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,519
You have been playing the same trick back and forth.

435
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,160
Do you think it's fun?

436
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,240
Is it fun?

437
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,720
You don't say.

438
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,240
I think it's quite fun sometimes.

439
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,759
Take care.

440
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,319
The world won't rotate without you.

441
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,640
It will rotate as usual.

442
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,880
Is Mr. Bao leaving again?

443
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,960
Xiao Han.

444
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,119
Why are you leaving again?

445
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,880
- Is he serious? - Why is he leaving again?

446
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't know.

447
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,240
What's the matter?

448
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,359
He is creating a scene again.

449
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,240
He came and left.

450
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,079
Xiao Han.

451
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,920
Come in.

452
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,759
Mr. Hou.

453
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,759
The company just received a letter of attorney.

454
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,599
A letter of attorney?

455
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,599
There's something I think you should see.

456
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,519
(Letter of attorney)

457
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,720
"Mr. Hou Zhi Rong of Zhirong Construction,"

458
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,240

466

"On April 28, 2019,"

467
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,880
"he returned to the company and continued making designs."

468
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
"During the job,"

469
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,400

470

"is copyrighted and the copyright belongs to the designer,"

474
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,960
"that is Mr. Bao Xiao Han."

475
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,599
"Without authorization from the designer,"

476
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,240
"that is Mr. Bao Xiao Han,"

477
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,319
"no one is allowed to use it without permission."

478
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,440
"No one is allowed to use it without permission."

479
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
You've got to be kidding me.

480
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,319
Who does he think he is?

481
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Mr. Hou.

482
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,440
We have lost our previous design.

483
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,279
Right now, if Xiao Han...

484
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,400
won't let us use his design,

485
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,200
then the company's tender...

486
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,359
is at stake.

487
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,440
We can't find Bao Xiao Han back, can we?

488
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,000
He will rip us off.

489
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,680
He's nothing.

490
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,720
To you,

491
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,680
I think what's most important is...

492
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,279
to find a way...

493
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,799
and get the foreign-owned hotel project at all costs.

494
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,440
That way, the company can overcome this crisis.

495
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,599
I did some research in the industry.

496
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:05,160
What Xiao Han asked for is nothing.

497
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,400
Other companies...

498
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,240
are using this kind of new contract...

499
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,319
to steal designers.

500
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,279
Lack of forbearance in small matters spoils great plans.

501
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm telling you, Ma Yong.

502
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
I, Hou Zhi Rong,

503
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,160
won't be threatened by him.

504
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,160
I won't be threatened by him.

505
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't believe this nonsense.

506
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,599
Without Bao Xiao Han,

507
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,599
is Zhirong Construction closing down?

508
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,039
It's okay if he doesn't want to do it.

509
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,440
I'll do it myself.

510
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,400
Li Li.

511
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,079
This is last month's sales report.

512
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,679
Bring it to Mr. Wang and others later.

513
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,440
Mr. Wang and the others are still eating.

514
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,639
Can you guys keep it down?

515
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,769
It's a movie.

516
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,519
No, you...

517
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,000
That's enough.

518
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,769
He is performing well in this movie.

519
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,039
Given the company's situation,

520
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,159
at our age, we are in trouble.

521
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,199
Yes.

522
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,719
What should we do in the future?

523
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,199
I'm going now.

524
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,289
Wait.

525
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,559
What were you two talking about?

526
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Not really.

527
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,679
Not really. We just want to go for a drink tonight.

528
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,880
Yes.

529
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,599
We had a deal.

530
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,079
We inform each other of everything.

531
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,159
Don't try anything behind my back.

532
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:16,599
Of course we are not.

533
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,719
Think about it.

534
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,880
We joined the company almost at the same time.

535
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,440
The company is a mess right now.

536
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,000
We're in this together.

537
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,159
Yes.

538
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:27,239
We're in this together.

539
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,079
That's more like it. See you.

540
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,079
Hello, Mr. Mao?

541
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:38,289
I am Liu Wen Xin.

542
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,519
Were you all right after the drink?

543
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,360
All right. That's good.

544
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,440
I'm just happy.

545
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,960
And the other thing is...

546
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,880
about what we talked about that day.

547
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,289
Yes, I want to develop my career at your place.

548
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:52,329
You said you'd think about it.

549
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,719
How did it go?

550
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,480
Mr. Liu, it's time for the meeting.

551
00:36:58,329 --> 00:36:59,920
Yes. I've been thinking about it.

552
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,769
Please say something.

553
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,329
I'm always ready.

554
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,679
I'm not picky.

555
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,639
Okay. I'll see you tonight.

556
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,239
Same place, same time.

557
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,289
I'll bring you two bottles of good wine.

558
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,440
That's all.

559
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,809
Okay, bye, Mr. Mao.

560
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:18,920
It's on you.

561
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,440
What does it have to do with me?

562
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,920
Mr. Hou, you're already here.

563
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,519
Mr. Hou.

564
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,519
We were running a little late.

565
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,289
- It's okay. Have a seat. - Mr. Hou.

566
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,599
Have a seat.

567
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,679
Mr. Ma.

568
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,039
Let's begin.

569
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,809
Take a look at the screen.

570
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,519
What do you think...

571
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,719
of this design?

572
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,960
Why haven't I seen this plan before?

573
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,679
I designed it.

574
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,920
Mr. Hou.

575
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,679
You are doing it yourself.

576
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:24,599
How long did it take?

577
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,039
That's so fast.

578
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,480
It's just a piece of cake.

579
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,039
Mr. Hou.

580
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,480
This tender is indeed very important to our company.

581
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:34,679
But the fact that you designed it yourself,

582
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,960
isn't this like using a cannon to catch mosquitoes?

583
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Yes.

584
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:41,039
Let's not talk so much.

585
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm asking you.

586
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,329
What do you think about the design?

587
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,159
Does it have a soul?

588
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,239
Yes, there is.

589
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,440
Yes. It's simple and elegant.

590
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,960
Yes.

591
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,199
Mr. Hou's design is extraordinary.

592
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,769
It has reflected...

593
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,329
our company's design skills.

594
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,809
How is it compared to Bao Xiao Han's design?

595
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,400
This is completely different and apparently better.

596
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,880
As the saying goes, "The older, the wiser."

597
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,079
If we use this design...

598
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,719
for the bidding,

599
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,559
do you think we can win?

600
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:18,809
Yes.

601
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Yes.

602
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Absolutely.

603
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,769
I'm sure we can win.

604
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,239
Let's give Mr. Hou a round of applause...

605
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,519
for coming up with such a perfect design.

606
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:27,809
Let's clap.

607
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:38,000
One of the highlights of our design...

608
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,719
is this look.

609
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,809
After some careful consideration,

610
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,039
when these two go together,

611
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,039
it's great,

612
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,639
but the seams are tricky.

613
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,400
It's not impossible to do it,

614
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,599
but the production cost will be very high.

615
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,599
This is the first time we worked together with Great King.

616
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,199
Don't make any mistakes.

617
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,880
Cost addition is a taboo for bidding.

618
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,079
It's got to be fixed.

619
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,119
Yes, I asked a few people I know.

620
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:07,360
There's not much we can do.

621
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,039
Friends, we don't have much time.

622
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,079
Let's work together to help Hou Jue.

623
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,079
In 24 hours,

624
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,599
we need to come up with the best solution.

625
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,039
I want the best one.

626
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,400
No one can fool around with it. Do you hear me?

627
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,000
This is not realistic.

628
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,880
- Aren't we just messing around? - Will you shut up?

629
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,400
Mr. Xiao, we can think of a way,

630
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:27,920
but don't put high hope...

631
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,239
on us.

632
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,519
No, I'm wondering.

633
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,559
You two are usually the aggressive ones.

634
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,639
What's wrong today?

635
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,159
Bosses,

636
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,719
give us a way out.

637
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,000
I know a good designer.

638
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,559
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

639
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:44,119
He transferred from my company to Zhirong Construction.

640
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,960
I heard he's having a hard time at Zhirong Construction these days.

641
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,119
He just left again.

642
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,440
- Who is it? - Bao Xiao Han.

643
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,239
I know him.

644
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
He is very talented.

645
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,480
I think if we can get Bao Xiao Han to do it,

646
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,360
he can be of great help to us.

647
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,329
But there's a problem.

648
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,000
We are just a small company.

649
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,719
Do you think we can afford...

650
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
a big shot like him?

651
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,329
I think he will do it if the project is huge.

652
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,920
Leave it to me.

653
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,440
I'll give him a call.

654
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,400
Sure. Look at you.
