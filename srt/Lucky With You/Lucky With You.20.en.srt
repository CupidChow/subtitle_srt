(A project funded by Zhejiang Cultural Art Development Foundation)

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,799
(Directed by Liu Xue Song)

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,120
(Episode 20)

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,920
How do you prove you didn't do it?

5
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,000
Wait a minute.

6
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,760
The thing is...

7
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,239
why do I have to prove something I didn't even do?

8
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,000
Then why are you in such a panic?

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,480
No, that isn't the point.

10
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,120
Mr. Hou is more anxious than you about the proposal being leaked.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,519
Xiao Han, calm down first.

12
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,319
This is just a routine investigation.

13
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,879
It's a necessary procedure, isn't that right?

14
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,920
You tell me.

15
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
No, this isn't a routine interrogation.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,240
You're obviously suspecting me.

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,319
The problem is...

18
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,479
why should I steal my own idea?

19
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,120
I think it's strange too.

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,639
Why did you steal your own proposal?

21
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,879
What's your motive?

22
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,879
Besides,

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,479
Mr. Hou has decided...

24
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,120
to use your proposal for the bidding.

25
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,639
Of course.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,090
We showed it to Hou Jue...

27
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,599
as we want him to suggest something...

28
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,599
and improve your proposal.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
I think...

30
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,680
Xiao Han,

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,719
the company's interest always comes first.

32
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,919
You must put aside your own gains and losses.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,039
So what do you think?

34
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,000
Be honest.

35
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,960
Let us all know.

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,159
I got it now.

37
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,120
It's not suspicion.

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,280
You are certain...

39
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,159
that I did it, right?

40
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,280
Okay.

41
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,840
In that case,

42
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,800
let me say something.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,919
First of all,

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,599
I've never done it.

45
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,120
Yes.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,319
When I saw my design...

47
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,319
at Hou Jue's table,

48
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
I was surprised.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
And I was frustrated.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,039
I thought the credit...

51
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,800
would go to someone else again.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
But what could I do?

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
I couldn't do anything.

54
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,599
That's why I feel miserable.

55
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,080
I didn't even want to eat lunch.

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,719
I just wanted to take a nap.

57
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,439
I needed to get a grip on myself.

58
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,759
Secondly,

59
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,680
you said you have been treating me well.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,360
I really don't know...

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
where you got the idea.

62
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,960
You two recruited me back then.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,039
Right?

64
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,360
And you promised me...

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,170
a lot of money and a position.

66
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,639
But what happened?

67
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,050
What have I achieved so far?

68
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,360
I don't want to continue toiling for someone else.

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
I have to live too.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,399
I need to eat too.

71
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,170
I can't live with...

72
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,879
all the false hopes you gave me.

73
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,439
I have also lost the minimum respect...

74
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,839
and trust I have left for you all.

75
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,120
You have crossed the line.

76
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,399
So I don't think...

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,399
I need to be here.

78
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,519
I really don't.

79
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,730
What are you trying to do?

80
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,360
You want to quit?

81
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,480
Sure.

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,170
People in Zhirong Construction are free to come and go,

83
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,839
especially for ingrates and traitors like you.

84
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,360
I have five words for you.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Goodbye, I won't see you off.

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Am I the ingrate? Am I the traitor?

87
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,759
Okay.

88
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,120
Bye.

89
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm glad he left.

90
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,399
I didn't believe it at first.

91
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,759
The moment he left,

92
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,120
I believe at least 80 percent.

93
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,720
Didn't you hear what he said?

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,319
He needs money.

95
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,000
That's his motive.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,680
I think...

97
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,600
maybe another company...

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
got his proposal for a hefty price...

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,920
to stop us from winning.

100
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,000
What a shame. He is very talented.

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,279
Too bad he only cares about fame and fortune.

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
And he has let you down.

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,240
It doesn't matter.

104
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,120
Before the design was out,

105
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,279
I had respect for him.

106
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,680
Since the designs were leaked,

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
he doesn't matter to me anymore.

108
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,800
Then...

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,920
what should we do...

110
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,360
with the design?

111
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,800
Start over?

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,839
There are less than two weeks left.

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,759
It's too late to start over.

114
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,319
We can only adjust it.

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Inform everyone that we will have...

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
an emergency meeting in half an hour...

117
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,879
to discuss this matter.

118
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,959
Okay.

119
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,279
What are you looking at?

120
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,680
You have nothing better to do?

121
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,319
Are you here just to look at me?

122
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Fine.

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,000
Come home with me.

124
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,560
He's a professional.

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,000
He was rumored to have stolen the proposal.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,279
No way.

127
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,800
No way.

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Your coffee.

129
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,879
My dad said that Bao Xiao Han admitted to everything,

130
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,199
but I don't believe it.

131
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,720
Something doesn't feel right.

132
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,759
It can't be Bao Xiao Han.

133
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,639
Give me your view.

134
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,240
- Mr. Hou. - Mr. Hou.

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,360
- Mr. Hou. - Mr. Hou.

136
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,240
- Mr. Hou. - Mr. Hou.

137
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,959
Just now,

138
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,399
a serious theft...

139
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,959
happened in the company.

140
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,279
We lost the proposal...

141
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,799
for Ruiji Hotel's tender.

142
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,960
The suspect is basically now...

143
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,330
Bao Xiao Han.

144
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,330
He has voluntarily resigned.

145
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,039
Remove him from all work group chats...

146
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,639
to avoid further leaks of the company's information.

147
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
The remaining two proposals...

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,240
have a lot of problems.

149
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,450
That's why I'm asking the Design Department...

150
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,120
to come up with another proposal...

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,639
that is better than the first one in three days.

152
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,240
Everyone in the meeting...

153
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
is encouraged to participate actively.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,039
Be it suggestions, opinions, or design a proposal,

155
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,799
if we accept it in the end,

156
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,480
the proposed person will be awarded.

157
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
Also,

158
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,450
I let Bao Xiao Han go today.

159
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,799
This is a special case.

160
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,360
This is a warning for all of you.

161
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,639
If something like this happens at the company again,

162
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,039
don't blame me for being rude.

163
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,480
Meeting is adjourned.

164
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,480
Mr. Hou is infuriated.

165
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,559
I don't understand.

166
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,919
Who would've thought that?

167
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,960
Are you still going to participate this time?

168
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

169
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,480
We lost Haicheng Project last time.

170
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,879
I made another proposal...

171
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,519
with some adjustments and modifications.

172
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,330
I think it's really good.

173
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,679
You're so thoughtful.

174
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,960
Didn't you teach me that?

175
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,519
Take your work seriously.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,600
Keep up the good work.

177
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,919
Today,

178
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,039
we covered a theory on forced water landing.

179
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
In the next lesson,

180
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,000
we're going to intern.

181
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,559
So when you get back,

182
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,679
make sure you digest everything you've learned today.

183
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,879
- Class dismissed. - Goodbye.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
Ms. Zhang, our hotel is available for trial now.

185
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
Experience it this weekend and give us some feedback.

186
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,600
I'll send a car to pick you up.

187
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,720
Did Lan Qi invite you?

188
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,159
Are you going too?

189
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you mean by that?

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,279
I'm Shi Yi's dad after all.

191
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you really think he's inviting us?

192
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,039
He is after your daughter.

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,039
Are you going then, Shi Yi's dad?

194
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm his dad. Of course I'll go for an inspection.

195
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
Should I go or not?

196
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,799
What are you doing?

197
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,440
What's the matter?

198
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,080
You're still concerned about solving the case?

199
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,960
Information gathering and analysis...

200
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,919
are a part of our job.

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
How fake.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,679
Show me what you've analyzed.

203
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,879
I have a feeling.

204
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,360
I don't think...

205
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,799
it's personal against you.

206
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,720
It's against Mr. Hou.

207
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,159
What do you mean?

208
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,919
Do you think I don't deserve to be targeted?

209
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,120
You can't give different treatment...

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
towards my dad and me.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
Be careful from now on.

I'm not sure.

I'm just putting together all the irregularities.

216
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,039
Why mention him when you aren't sure?

217
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,200
My dad is closer to Ma Yong...

218
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,679
than to me.

219
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,279
You act like a professional.

220
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,919

Don't move. We're going to the police station.

Let's go. Don't move.

Bless me, God of Wealth.

This is the first and the last.

I'm really sorry.

How long have you been here?

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,799
I've been cleaning up here.

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,320
What did you hear?

236
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,519
I didn't hear anything.

237
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,639
I heard you saying...

238
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,879
"Amitabha" and "blessing".

239
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,399
I'm telling you, it's a lucky cat.

240

It only brings money. It doesn't give blessings.

You're making it hard for the cat. What do you...

Disappear.

- Let me show you around. - All right.

Mr. Wu, Ms. Zhang.

260
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,039
This is the lobby.

261
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,519
Is it nice?

262
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,440

It's beautiful.

272
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,080
The hotel is right beside a mountain and a river.

It's really awesome.

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,120
the lobby and the entrance...

276
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,159
were still under construction.

277
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,240
Nothing was open.

278
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,720
Except for those commercial areas and the rooftop,

279
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,799
basically, it's already open for business.

280
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,960
Don't worry. Stay here for a few days.

Let me know what you think.

282

Lan Qi, you have invited the right person.

She's the reincarnated princess from "The Princess and the Pea".

284
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,559
If she is satisfied, you don't have to worry about anyone else.

285
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,720
- Okay. - Now that you mention it,

286

I feel like I'm really hard to please.

287

What would Lan Qi think of me?

288
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
When she worked for the international airlines,

289
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,960
she wanted to make hotels as her home so badly.

290
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,240
She has stayed at luxury hotels all over the world.

291
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,360
She has a say in that.

292
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
That's better.

293
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,759
You just can't talk nicely.

This hotel...

295
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,039
is targeting middle-class guests.

296
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,159
Our selling point is comfort.

297
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,559
Of course we are no match for a luxury hotel.

298
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,080
When it comes to hotels,

299
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,679
the most important thing is to be romantic and comfortable.

300
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,279
If it's too luxurious,

301
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,720
all the guests have to put on airs.

302
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,159
It's so tiring.

303
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,159
Yes.

304
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,519
Let's go to the other side.

305
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,720
- All right. - Let's go.

306
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,519
This way.

307
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,559
It's beautiful.

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,399
Okay.

We're here, Mr. Wu and Ms. Zhang.

311

These are your rooms. They are next to each other.

It's the same. You are free to choose.

313

Ladies first.

314
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,519
I'm staying in the next room.

Okay.

That's great.

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,890
What do you think, Ms. Zhang? Do you like this room?

320
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,410
It's amazing!

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,410
It's really great!

- I like it. - I'm glad you like it.

324
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,440
Come down when you're hungry.

325
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
All right.

326

Call me if there's anything.

327

You didn't even tell me.

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm telling you now.

337
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,200
Shi Yi.

338
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,410
This hotel is very well done.

339
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,960
You should come when you have time.

340
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,170
Did you hear me?

341
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,599
Did you go there with Dad?

342
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,650
There's no way I'm with him.

343
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,170
Is it?

344
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,599
I thought...

345
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,200
my dad was the one who jumped up from behind the photo.

346
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,039
Why does he look like a vengeful ghost?

347
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,650
You're everywhere.

348
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,519
He must be up to no good.

349
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,599
(Delete)

350
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,759
Ying Nan.

351
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,200
Where did you go?

352
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,839
I went to the beach for a walk.

353
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,359
The beach is really beautiful!

354
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,960
You made your way into my phone.

355
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,170
You're in my photo.

356
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,279
- Where is it? - See for yourself.

357
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,480
Let me see.

358
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,039
That's such a coincidence.

359
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,680
We are destined to be with each other.

360
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,039
Destiny? Don't be ridiculous.

361
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,170
Go to your room.

362
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,650
Don't go out again.

363
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,039
What are you saying?

364
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,000
Good idea.

365
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,319
Wake me up when it's dinner time.

366
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,279
All you do is eat.

367
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,599
I'm going to starve you to death.

368
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,599
From now until the opening,

369
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,890
I will make rounds.

370
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,759
Tell all the heads...

371
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,240
that the appearance of all the staff...

372
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,599
must follow the code.

373
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,039
Once they are caught,

374
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,039
they will have to leave immediately.

375
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,319
If more than three of the staff are caught, the head has to leave.

376
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,559
You may get back to work.

377
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,319
Thank you for taking care of my parents.

378
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,890
They're happy.

379
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,319
If they're happy, you're happy.

380
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,960
If you're happy, I'm happy.

381
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,890
What are you smiling about?

382
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,319
I've been looking at you.

383
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,319
My dad...

384
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,000
behaves like a moody teenager whenever he sees my mom.

385
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,410
It's been so many years, but he hasn't changed a bit.

386
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,839
Where did they go?

387
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,599
Lan Qi took them to the hotel.

388
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,559
Despicable...

389
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,319
is a coward's pass.

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,359
Noble...

391
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,440
is a noble man's motto.

392
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,119
Not a motto. I mean it's an epitaph.

393
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,890
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,599
It's none of your business.

395
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,890
Fine, it's none of my business.

396
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,279
I won't bother you.

397
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,960
Where are you going?

398
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,920
Are you going on a date?

399
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,440
No comment.

400
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm in danger. I need help.

401
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,119
No.

402
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,279
You will be all right.

403
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,119
What kind of woman is that?

404
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,720
Stewed chicken with snail.

405
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,240
Okay, that's all.

406
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,890
Okay, please wait a moment.

407
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,279
No MSG, please.

408
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,079
That's enough. What are you doing?

409
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,720
If Lan Qi sees this,

410
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,240
he would think that I did something to you.

411
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,880
You're everywhere.

412
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,680
You even appeared in the frame when I was taking a photo.

413
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,720
Look at you with those claws.

414
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,839
What are you trying to do?

415
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,680
So that's what this is about.

416
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,119
You're still laughing.

417
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,799
Watch out, sorrow always hits at the happiest moment.

418
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,880
Yes.

419
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,519
We're here for Shi Yi.

420
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,480
Let's not fight for our child's sake.

421
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,240
People will laugh at us.

422
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,559
So you realized it.

423
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,680
Ying Nan, let's get to the point.

424
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,400
Lan Qi...

425
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,319
has made himself very clear.

426
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,480
What matters is that he's doing well now.

427
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,160
Shi Yi must not screw up this time.

428
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,559
Even if she screws up, we must save her.

429
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,440
Lan Qi is a good man. We can't find him anywhere else.

430
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,039
He has everything. Shi Yi also had dated him before.

431
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,480
If this won't work...

432
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,279
Think about it.

433
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,880
What else between them...

434
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,240
that could be an obstacle？

435
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,680
You're carrying so many things.

436
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Yes.

437
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,720
It's just for one night, right?

438
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,759
Yes.

439
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,839
I don't know why he's bringing so much stuff.

440
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,799
- Gosh. - I'm going...

441
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,720
to prepare a feast for Chen Chen.

442
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,680
I'll let her taste my cooking.

443
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,000
Good idea.

444
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,759
I'll put the egg next to it. Don't break it.

445
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,839
You bring so many seasonings.

446
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,960
Yes, I have to bring them.

447
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,519
They are for seasoning, thickening the texture,

448
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,400
coloring, and making sauce.

449
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,440
I have to bring them.

450
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,160
Don't you think it's troublesome?

451
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,680
It's quite professional.

452
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,759
My cooking is my wingman.

453
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,400
Every girl who eats my food...

454
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,720
can't stay away from me.

455
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,559
What are you talking about? You're going to woo girls?

456
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,799
I've prepared so much for you.

457
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,279
So all these are for picking up girls?

458
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,359
- No, you are not having them. - No, I...

459
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,079
- Put it away. - I'm just kidding.

460
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,839
Don't take it seriously. Let go.

461
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,960
- You're taking it too seriously. - Gosh.

462
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,400
Put it inside.

463
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
The person who lives with you...

464
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,440
is someone who can eat everything with you, be it good or bad.

465
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,599
That won't do.

466
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,119
She's my woman. I can't let her have instant noodles, can I?

467
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,279
It's not just about feasting on my cooking every day.

468
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,319
She has to come back for your braised meat too.

469
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,480
That won't do.

470
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,160
My braised meat...

471
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,759
is only for Shi Yi.

472
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,359
I...

473
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,960
The girl that I'm wooing is Shi Yi.

474
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,359
Let go.

475
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,519
What are you saying?

476
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:35,599
Wooing Shi Yi?

477
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,920
It sounds awful.

478
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Don't talk nonsense.

479
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,119
Recently, you've been absentminded.

480
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,519
I don't know what you're thinking.

481
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,039
I think...

482
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,559
I'm using the provocation method.

483
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,880
I got it.

484
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,200
What are you two whispering about?

485
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,799
I heard that.

486
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,319
Isn't that inappropriate?

487
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,119
- It's so appropriate. - It's inappropriate.

488
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,599
It's appropriate.

489
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,519
Li Li is so unreliable.

490
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,319
She texted me just now asking us to pick her up.

491
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,680
She can't do it on her own.

492
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,119
Why should we?

493
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,160
Why do you have to pick her up?

494
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm meeting you at your house.

495
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,200
Because you're great. You're the best.

496
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,519
She has always been slow. That's not something new.

497
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:14,759
You know how she is.

498
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,000
Fine, just because you praised me,

499
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,119
I'll let you pick her up.

500
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,839
That's enough.

501
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,440
How do these earrings look?

502
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,680
It's okay.

503
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,400
I think your lipstick color is extra silly today.

504
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,880
- It doesn't suit you at all. - Why? It's a limited edition.

505
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,799
- Do you have a new... - Pretty ladies.

506
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,640
We are going out for just one day.

507
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,119
Why do you bring so many boxes?

508
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,920
It's for one day.

509
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,319
We have skipped many heavy stuff.

510
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,400
That's what women do. You don't understand.

511
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,720
Look at you. You're so annoying.

512
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,279
Okay, let's go.

513
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,400
Get in the car.

514
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,680
Have your bodyguard follow you behind.

515
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,720
Da Zhuang will go with her. Let me introduce him.

516
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,160
This is my family's cook.

517
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,640
No, she needs to be in my car.

518
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,119
Why?

519
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm warning you.

520
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,119
Don't get on my nerves today.

521
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,720
Look at you.

522
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,079
Okay then. You go with him.

523
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,119
Follow me behind.

524
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,359
It's okay.

525
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,799
All right. Don't be sad.

526
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,039
Get in.

527
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,039
Mr. Zhang, pick up my friend from Lijing Garden first.

528
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,039
Okay.

529
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,480
- Let's take a selfie. - Sure.

530
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,359
Three, two...

531
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,559
- Make me look good in the picture. - One.

532
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,960
Why aren't you showing your face?

533
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,400
I don't like taking photos.

534
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,759
You're making us look bad.

535
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,039
What's wrong with my expression?

536
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,119
I'm ugly too.

537
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,480
- Quick, take one more. - Do it again.

538
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,240
Look at the camera.

539
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,680
Do you think I'm okay? Include me in the photo.

540
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,480
No. It's just for the two of us.

541
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,119
Who said you could come in?

542
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,039
How impatient.

543
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,119
Let it be.

544
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
Tell me.

545
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,279
Why did you hire a female sidekick?

546
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,799
She was hired by my dad.

547
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,359
What's the difference between boys and girls anyway?

548
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,359
Come on.

549
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
I'm sure you asked for it.

550
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,920
If it's me, I'll ask for someone handsome.

551
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,720
Why would I ask for that?

552
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,599
Is she single or married?

553
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,400
I think she is single.

554
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,599
That's great.

555
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,519
Our chef, Da Zhuang,

556
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,720
is my distant relative.

557
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,920
According to seniority,

558
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,720
he has to call me his grandma.

559
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,599
He happens to be single too.

560
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,839
How old is she?

561
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
She is 28 years old.

562
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,839
Da Zhuang is 25 years old.

563
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,880
A wife who is three years older than the husband ensures a richer life.

564
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,960
That's good.

565
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,039
What do you two think?

566
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,160
- How cute. - All right.

567
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,720
We just got a pair off yesterday.

568
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,799
Let's pair up again today.

569
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,759
- We're even now. - Perfect.

570
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,319
Let's make the call!

571
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,759
What are you doing? Are you calling your grandson?

572
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,640
I have to see if my grandson is interested in her.

573
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,160
Put him on speaker.

574
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,559
Hello?

575
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,160
Da Zhuang, can you hear me?

576
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,400
The woman sitting next to you right now...

577
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,759
is my buddy's sidekick.

578
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,480
She said she fell in love with you at first sight.

579
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,440
She couldn't stop herself.

580
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,200
She likes you so much.

581
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,279
It's true.

582
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,640
Take a look at her. Are you interested in her?

583
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,039
I do.

584
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,759
I knew my grandson would like her.

585
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,920
You told me to introduce you to someone.

586
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,839
That's all I have to say.

587
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,720
I've already left her there for you.

588
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,680
The rest is up to you.

589
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,480
Go, Pikachu.

590
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,440
Don't hang up.

591
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:02,079
Okay, thank you.

592
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,880
Hello, my name is Ding Da Zhuang.

593
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,720
Hello.

594
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,720
We already introduced ourselves.

595
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,279
My name is Wu Shi Yi.

596
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:17,039
I live in Anhui, Huangshan.

597
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,920
I have two siblings.

598
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,599
I have a younger brother.

599
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm 25 years old.

600
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,480
Our family used to run a restaurant.

601
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,039
I'm 183cm tall.

602
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,920
No, I mean 173cm.

603
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,119
My weight is 82kg.

604
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,960
I'm neither a smoker nor a drunkard.

605
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,319
I used to run a hot pot restaurant too.

606
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,240
I sold barbecues and roasted camels.

607
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,799
Roasted camels?

608
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,480
- Are you nervous? - Back then...

609
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,680
He introduced himself so sincerely.

610
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,920
This is called being honest.

611
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,720
He is not a smooth talker like you guys.

612
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,559
Listen, most people can't stand it.

613
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,839
Your bodyguard...

614
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,279
Your sidekick is too fierce.

615
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,160
She scares everyone off.

616
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,119
I'm sorry.

617
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,640
I didn't get what you said.

618
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,799
Are you from Shanxi?

619
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,440
Yes, Shanxi, Huangshan.

620
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,960
Shanxi is a nice place.

621
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,160
No, I'm not from Shanxi.

622
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,359
- Are you from Shandong? - No, I'm from Anhui.

623
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,319
You mean Anhui in Datong?

624
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,680
No, I'm not.

625
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,960
Are you from Shanxi, Huangshan?

626
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,720
No, I'm not from Shanxi.

627
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,759
It has nothing to do with the mountain.

628
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,119
So you are not from Huangshan.

629
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,240
No.

630
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,279
- What are you smiling at? - Yes or no?

631
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,640
That's enough. Hang up the call.

632
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,160
It takes a lot of electricity.

633
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,880
No, it only takes five minutes to recharge.

634
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,599
Can you do better?

635
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,599
How does he even woo girls?

636
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,839
It's okay. If Da Zhuang is not good enough, I have more.

637
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,599
There's plenty for you to meet.

638
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,440
Don't worry. I've arranged everything well for you.

639
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,200
Where exactly does he come from?

640
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,799
Stop laughing.

641
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,319
Room 2618.

642
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,480
Are you together?

643
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,680
- This way. - This one? It's that direction.

644
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,480
- We're right here. - We're over here.

645
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,400
- What should we do later? - See you at the beach.

646
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,480
All right.

647
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,000
- Do you still want your luggage? - I almost forgot.

648
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,680
Where's my keycard?

649
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
Come in.

650
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,079
- What? - Come in first.

651
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,799
What are you doing?

652
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,240
Nothing. Here's your room.

653
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,319
That's not right.

654
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,680
Stop dreaming.

655
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,240
You stay there, I'll stay here.

656
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,960
Da Zhuang, take my luggage to the room.

657
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,279
Where are you going?

658
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,880
It's not like you live in this room.

659
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,279
I know.

660
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,000
Then why did you go that way?

661
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,480
I have to inspect the room.

662
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,559
What's there to check about this room?

663
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,359
It's my job.

664
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,799
Your bodyguard is interesting.

665
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,079
She takes care of everything.

666
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,119
No, you're interesting.

667
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,960
Why are we sharing a room?

668
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,599
Can't I stay with you longer?

669
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,720
Moreover, we are staying at different sides.

670
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,960
I'm not in your way.

671
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,559
And we're so far away.

672
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,160
- I won't do anything to you, right? - Chen Chen.

673
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,319
It's all set.

674
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,720
I'm going to my room to rest.

675
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,839
Okay. Go back to your room.

676
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,400
All right.

677
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,599
I checked all the rooms.

678
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,200
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

679
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,720
You're leaving?

680
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,079
Can't you see I'm in danger here?

681
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,640
How are you in danger? I...

682
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,720
What's wrong? Am I a tigress?

683
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,200
You should know better.

684
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,160
My room is right next door.

685
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,559
Call me anytime.

686
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,079
It's nothing. You should go.

687
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,200
Close the door.

688
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,359
- What are you doing? - What do you mean?

689
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,599
I'm going back to my room.

690
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,759
Hurry up. Get changed and go to the beach.

691
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,160
Why do you have to look so imposing going to your room?

692
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,519
Are you staying in this room?

693
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,400
Yes, Chen Chen made me stay here.

694
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,519
Okay.

695
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,000
Why didn't you close the door?

696
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,799
Can you buy...

697
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,359
Why are you here?

698
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,920
Chen Chen told me to stay here.

699
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,640
Well...

700
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,160
I have something to tell you.

701
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,039
Chen Chen...

702
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,480
is looking for you.

703
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,480
- You don't have the keycard, right? - No.

704
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,599
- No. - Go ahead.

705
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,519
What is going on?

706
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,079
This is ridiculous.

707
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,440
Look at them.

708
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
You know how to swim, right?

709
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,289
I can if I have to.

710
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,199
That's good.

711
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,480
Open the door!

712
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,079
Open the door!

713
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,960
- What are you doing? - Open the door!

714
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,400
- Are you tearing down the house? - Da Zhuang, get in here!

715
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,809
Let's find out who stops Da Zhuang from staying here. I paid for him.

716
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,880
Who do you think you are?

717
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,360
Don't cause trouble for no reason.

718
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,559
Can Da Zhuang and Shi Yi stay together?

719
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:31,679
Why can't they stay together?

720
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,239
Stop pretending. Don't you know men and women are different?

721
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,840
Are you protecting your sweetie?

722
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,199
She is precious. Da Zhuang is even more precious.

723
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,809
Da Zhuang has never been in love for the past two decades.

724
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,880
If they are together, it's Da Zhuang's loss.

725
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,400
Ms. Chen.

726
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,289
Please watch your language.

727
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,329
It's none of your business.

728
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:47,679
Who do you think you are? Get lost.

729
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,769
Chen Chen, listen.

730
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:50,519
If you don't have the least respect for others,

731
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,920
I don't consider you my friend anymore.

732
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,639
Well done, Hou Jue.

733
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,400
Are you taking her side now?

734
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,039
I'm telling you, if you take her side,

735
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,159
I'll go back and tell my dad...

736
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,360
to stop working with your dad.

737
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,880
We will never work with you again!

738
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,920
You wish.

739
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,769
The collaboration is over! Get lost!

740
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:08,559
Get lost, all of you.

741
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:12,079
- Let's go. - Fine, forget it.

742
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,519
We are just sharing a room.

743
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,199
Da Zhuang is staying inside.

744
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,809
I will sleep on the couch.

745
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:19,239
What are you saying?

746
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,000
No way. I'm telling you.

747
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,039
It's not about one room.

748
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,119
Do you understand?

749
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,639
She is mine!

750
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,079
I don't need your room.

751
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,039
Don't bully my people, okay?

752
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,599
Your people?

753
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,719
- Why are you yelling at me for her? - Cut the crap!

754
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,880
Let's go.

755
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,329
Hou Jue, what are you doing?

756
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:43,559
This is fun.

757
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,329
What's wrong?

758
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:47,679
What is going on?

759
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,199
It's too much!

760
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,880
Are we still swimming?

761
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:55,289
Who cares about swimming?

762
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,079
If you are not coming, we shall swim on our own.

763
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,329
- Let's go. - Bye.

764
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,400
You!

765
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,119
Why are you doing this?

766
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,039
Hurry up. We're already in our swimming suits.

767
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,920
What's wrong with me?

768
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,239
I'm sorry.

769
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,599
I've caused you trouble again.

770
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,679
It's okay.

771
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:17,840
You don't even have to think about that.

772
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,769
I'm telling you. She has such a temper.

773
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,960
Even if it didn't happen just now, it would still happen later.

774
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,119
It's just a matter of time.

775
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,289
So from this moment onwards,

776
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,719
we must not bow to her.

777
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,719
But...

778
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,880
It's okay.

779
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,480
You don't have to worry about her dad.

780
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,840
Even if her dad complains to my dad,

781
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,769
even if her dad is unhappy and stop doing business with my dad,

782
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,360
I don't care, okay?

783
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,400
My people...

784
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,440
should never be wronged.

785
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm not that weak.

786
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,840
An old client misunderstood our profession too.

787
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:56,199
He looked down on us and treated us like servants.

788
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,880
He was disrespectful too.

789
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,599
When you meet someone like that,

790
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,400
what do you usually do to them?

791
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,960
I could only build up my mental strength.

792
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,840
If you can handle it, you can ignore it.

793
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,039
Otherwise, I would just focus on work.

794
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,119
I'm surprised.

795
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,289
People who are as skillful as you...

796
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,480
could still reflect on themselves at times like that...

797
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,440
and could take the misconception.

798
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,079
It's no big deal.

799
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:28,199
Everyone gets misunderstood at some point.

800
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,199
Aren't you the same?

801
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,639
You are misunderstood...

802
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,840
that you rely on your family background.

803
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,039
At times like that, you can only rely on yourself...

804
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,769
and try to prove them wrong.

805
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,289
Nothing else works.

806
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:42,000
Yes, you're absolutely right.

807
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,199
Because of my family background,

808
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,289
when a friend of mine told me that I resemble Chen Chen,

809
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:47,360
I got angry.

810
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,519
What was he saying?

811
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,000
Shi Yi, wash up and go to bed.

812
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,289
Let's not stoop to her level.

813
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,119
There's no need.

814
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,480
My goodness.

815
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,039
She was too immature.

816
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,559
Look at Chen Chen.

817
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,769
I'm telling you.

818
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:17,599
I saw her when I was little.

819
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,079
No, not when I was little.

820
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,679
I mean, I met her when she was little.

821
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,840
Her parents had her at a late age.

822
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,769
They really doted on her.

823
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,000
She was so spoiled.

824
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,239
She is educated.

825
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,840
She even studied abroad,

826
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,159
but I think she has learned nothing.

827
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,599
Gosh.

828
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,809
Is Shi Yi all right?

829
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,769
It's okay. I got her covered.

830
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,289
That's better.

831
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,480
It's your fault.

832
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
When you told me...

833
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,559
you are using the provocation method,

834
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,960
I was a little worried.

835
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,679
Do you know that if you go too far,

836
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,679
you would hurt Shi Yi?

837
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,079
I don't know.

838
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,809
I don't know what to do.

839
00:38:56,809 --> 00:38:58,880
Accidents are everywhere.

840
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,769
I can't predict them.

841
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,199
Remember this.

842
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,639
Sometimes, no trick is the best trick.

843
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,119
You can take your time.

844
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,079
All right, stop playing over there.

845
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,440
Go to bed.

846
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,000
Let's sleep.

847
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,519
You're always causing trouble.

848
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,119
Gosh.

849
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,769
My precious daughter, you have to join Lan Qi's hotel.

850
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,559
If you come, you'll be the security director.

851
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,559
You don't have to suffer anymore.

852
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,920
My precious daughter, are you tired from work?

853
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,719
If you are, come to Lan Qi's hotel.

854
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:03,840
Don't force yourself.

855
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,360
What's the purpose?

856
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,400
Come in.

857
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,840
This is an herbal tea made by Ms. Zhang.

858
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,400
It's to calm you down.

859
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Thank you.

860
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,360
If there are two options,

861
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,599
where one is more comfortable...

862
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,880
while the other is rough,

863
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,639
which one would you choose?

864
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,519
Do you want to discuss such an in-depth matter with me?

865
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,199
No. I'm asking the wrong person. I...

866
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,239
Get some rest. Go to sleep.

867
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,809
- It's okay, Listen. - It's okay.

868
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:58,159
I'm asking the wrong person. Get some sleep.

869
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,480
It's a philosophical question...

870
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,289
and I'm good at answering it.

871
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
First of all,

872
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,159
where do these roads lead to?

873
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,000
Human beings...

874
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,769
will die eventually.

875
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,199
I got it now.

876
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,769
You're at a crossroads in life...

877
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,289
and you have two choices before you.

878
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,159
One of them is a flat road...

879
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,920
while another is a bumpy road.

880
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,809
In the end, death is the direction they take.

881
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,809
You hesitated for a long time at the junction,

882
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,289
not knowing what to do.

883
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:31,719
That's why you are seeking help from me.

884
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,480
I'm telling you.

885
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,960
If this was back in the day...
