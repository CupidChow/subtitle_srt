(Episode 30)

4
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,519
I think love might be...

5
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,480
When you can't see her,

6
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,159
you'd miss her.

7
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,599
You'd wonder what she's doing...

8
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,640
and who she is with.

9
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,760
Perhaps it's a kind of yearning.

10
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
No.

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,439
There are too many people to meet every day.

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,799
Is there more?

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,879
And you will always...

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,439
For example,

15
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,639
when she's not with you, you'll be reminded

16
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,439
of every single thing you did with her...

17
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,919
and something that happened when you were with her.

18
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,759
No.

19
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,639
There's so much going on in my head every day.

20
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,039
You are reminded of her...

21
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
when you see certain scenes.

22
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,280
For example, listening to a song.

23
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,680
Or when you have a glass of delicious drink...

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,840
or a nice dessert.

25
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,199
There are a lot of things that you can remember...

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
or remind you of her.

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Whenever she's happy, you're happy.

28
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,840
If she's sick,

29
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,800
you'll feel sorry for her.

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
I won't necessarily feel sorry for her just because she is sick...

31
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,159
but I'll take her to the hospital.

32
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,159
I'll buy her whatever she needs.

33
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,080
I'll give her a present on her birthday.

34
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,560
I will throw a party for her.

35
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,800
If her brother doesn't have a job,

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,199
I'll take care of it.

37
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,719
If her mom is sick,

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,159
I would take her to the best doctor.

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,919
Shi Yi.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
We're not students anymore.

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,479
In life,

42
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,840
if you're always so unrealistic,

43
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,240
it's going to be tough.

44
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,360
We're not young anymore.

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,319
It's time to get real.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,719
As for me,

47
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,039
I want my other half...

48
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,360
to give me what I want.

49
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,240
In return, I can give her what she wants.

50
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,599
As long as we both want the same thing...

51
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,120
in life.

52
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,719
What about you?

53
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,050
What do you want from your other half?

54
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,360
I think...

55
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,519
at least...

56
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,319
he has to be simple...

57
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,800
and sincere.

58
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,839
At least, in front of me.

59
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,199
So I can see through him.

60
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,680
Okay.

61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,920
It's late.

62
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,680
Get some rest.

63
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,920
Good night.

64
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,079
Good night.

65
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,360
Boss.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,759
What are you doing?

67
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,610
The shirt that you tore open today...

68
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,920
Why don't you give it to me?

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,519
Well...

70
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,639
I can still wear it even if it is broken.

71
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,879
Stop thinking about it.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll keep it.

73
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,360
That's not it.

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,879
I just want to take a look...

75
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,959
and see if I can mend it for you.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
I didn't know you can do that.

77
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,920
Of course.

78
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,439
What is so hard about sewing?

79
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,920
Where did you get that needle and thread?

80
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,480
I brought them myself.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,199
You're good at hiding things.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
Boss, are you complimenting me?

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,680
It has been a while since you complimented me.

84
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,839
To be honest,

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,560
it's hard to find...

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,000
a girl like me nowadays.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,319
Not only am I pretty,

88
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,720
I'm quite capable too.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,879
Other than sewing,

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,959
I also know how to knit.

91
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,839
In my family, the sweaters and pants for winter,

92
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,079
not forgetting fuzzy socks...

93
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,920
are all made by me.

94
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,879
You're quite mature for your age.

95
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,120
It fits...

96
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,319
Let me get you some water.

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
Thank you, boss.

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,360
I have to thank you.

99
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,079
Okay, take a look.

100
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,639
- That was fast. - Yes.

101
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,720
It's really nice.

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,879
Look at this.

103
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,480
Where is it?

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,000
All right, you...

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
You saved me a lot of money.

106
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,720
I don't have to pay someone to do it.

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
- I'm good, right? - You are good.

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
Boss.

109
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,600
Other than sewing...

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,720
and knitting,

111
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,680
I know some other great stuff too.

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
What else do you know?

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,800
I think my greatest skill is...

114
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,360
I can make a sofa.

115
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's put that aside for now.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,120
That skill is not needed for now.

117
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,720
I also know how to make soles.

118
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
I can make fabric shoes.

119
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,279
- How about this? - That'll work.

120
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
My shoe size is four and a half.

121
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,319
You can take care of it.

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,680
Boss, your feet are quite small.

123
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,439
But it's great. I can save on fabric.

124
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,279
I'm going to the fabric market tomorrow.

125
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll find something good for you.

126
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
I'll make a pair of cloth shoes for you.

127
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
Doesn't the cloth shoe cause pain to the feet?

128
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
No.

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,839
There's no way it's not comfortable.

130
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,399
If you think cloth shoes are not stylish,

131
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,800
then wear them at home.

132
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,959
If you think it's too slippery and not durable,

133
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,480
I'll give you a rubber base.

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,519
How is it?

135
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,480
Okay.

136
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,879
Go home and rest.

137
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
That's right.

138
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,519
Good night, boss.

139
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,079
Thank you for your hard work.

140
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,839
- Okay. - Go home early.

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Go home early.

142
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,759
Boss.

143
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,399
Boss.

144
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,480
What's wrong?

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Well...

146
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,120
I went down to take a look.

147
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,210
There was no one in the shop.

148
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,330
Mr. Tian, Hei, and others...

149
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,519
had left early.

150
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,759
They didn't even tell me.

151
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,879
Besides, at this hour,

152
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,600
the bus and the trains are all gone.

153
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,039
- Fine. - I'm scared to go back alone.

154
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,159
I understand what you mean.

155
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,799
Then...

156
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,399
You may stay in Shi Yi's room.

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,210
She's not in. It's empty.

158
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,519
Okay, get the master card and open the door.

159
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,679
Go on.

160
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,919
- Really? - That's right.

161
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,000
Hurry up and go.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,679
Is the room right below your room?

163
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,679
Yes, go on.

164
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,039
Thank you, boss.

165
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,639
Good night, Boss.

166
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,759
Good night.

167
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,919
I'm so sleepy.

168
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
Yes.

169
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,120
Where is the elevator?

170
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,919
Where is the elevator?

171
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,600
It's over there.

172
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,759
- Where's the elevator? - The elevator is over there.

173
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,679
- Okay, thank you. - Over there.

174
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,639
I can do it.

175
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,679
Yes, you can.

176
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
Drink more.

177
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,120
Keep it down.

178
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,679
Be good, little bunny.

179
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,879
Where's the card?

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,330
Where's the card?

181
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,559
Open the door.

182
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,240
Card...

183
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Here's the card.

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't touch it.

185
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,799
Here's the card.

186
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
Open it.

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,090
Open the door.

188
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,440
Hurry, lie down.

189
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,799
You can't drink but you insisted.

190
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,600
Give me another bottle.

191
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,039
Don't go.

192
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,240
What are you doing?

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
Say it. Don't get physical.

194
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,679
Stay with me.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Stay with me.

196
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,480
- Chen Chen. - Stay with me.

197
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,159
Stay with me.

198
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,559
Stay with me today.

199
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,240
Stay with me.

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,519
Stop fooling around, okay?

201
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,000
Stay with me.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,159
You can't go.

203
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,679
Stop fooling around. I'm not leaving.

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,639
Let me go!

205
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,000
Let go.

206
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,440
You...

207
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,559
Do you like me?

208
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,799
Your phone's ringing.

209
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,519
(Dad)

210
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,120
It's your dad.

211
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,279
Your dad is calling.

212
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,960
Dad.

213
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,600
Dad, I miss you.

214
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,799
I was wrong. I'm in Shenzhen.

215
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm with Hou Jue.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, I'm with my boyfriend.

217
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,840
Dad, he doesn't like me.

218
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,240
Hello, Mr. Chen.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,679
I'm Hou Jue.

220
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,600
Chen Chen is drunk.

221
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,000
It's okay.

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,159
I've already taken her to the hotel.

223
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,320
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

224
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,360
Don't worry.

225
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,080
Okay, okay.

226
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,039
Why?

227
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,519
You're talking nonsense.

228
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,039
Why?

229
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,240
Come on, let go.

230
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,120
Don't go!

231
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,200
Don't go.

232
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Here.

233
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,159
- Don't go. - Hold it.

234
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,480
Don't go.

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,320
Okay.

236
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,200
Gosh.

237
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,559
This is too much.

238
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm exhausted.

239
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,559
Hou Jue, you...

240
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,600
What's your problem?

241
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,919
You're crazy.

242
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,639
Why aren't you sleeping on the big bed?

243
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,759
Why are you sleeping here?

244
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,399
If I buy this hotel,

245
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,720
are you going to hide in the basement?

246
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,679
I was kind enough to take you here.

247
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,000
I did promise your dad that I would take care of you.

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Does that include sleeping with you?

249
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,159
I'm so dizzy.

250
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm very angry right now.

251
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,960
Am I not good enough for you?

252
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,359
Didn't you hear that I said I'm mad at you?

253
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,319
Well, go on.

254
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,440
What are you doing?

255
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,599
Hou Jue, stop right there.

256
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,079
Where are you going?

257
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,359
Home.

258
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,319
If you go home today,

259
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,039
I won't help you come up with a plan.

260
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,480
There's no need.

261
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,000
Hou Jue!

262
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,559
Hou Jue!

263
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,599
The opening of our hotel is in five days.

264
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Let me emphasize this.

265
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,890
Security is our main concern.

266
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,799
Starting tomorrow,

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,240
the other six shareholders...

268
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
will arrive at the hotel one by one.

269
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
They will check into the Presidential Suite.

270
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,410
They have security guards with them.

271
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,410
They are not our responsibility.

272
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,200
Our main target is Mr. Lan...

273
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,519
and all the other guests.

274
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,359
I have a list of all the guests.

275
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,480
I'll hand them out later.

276
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,319
The ribbon-cutting ceremony...

277
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,170
will take place in the hotel's garden.

278
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,279
The opening party...

279
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,650
will be held at the banquet hall on the second floor.

280
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,759
From the lobby on the first floor...

281
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,839
to the banquet hall on the second floor,

282
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,170
there are two passageways,

283
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,519
that is the elevators and spindles.

284
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,410
On the opening day, a total of three restaurants...

285
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,650
and a cafe will be operating as usual.

286
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,799
Book bar is excluded.

287
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,960
The book bar is under construction.

288
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,359
But it'll be empty on the opening day.

289
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,799
Bring me all the floor plans of these stores,

290
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,890
including the book bar.

291
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,920
Okay.

292
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,359
Is this a picnic in middle school?

293
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,680
Is this a picnic in middle school?

294
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,720
What is this? A plastic plate?

295
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,039
Is it a plastic plate?

296
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,650
Put another camera up over here.

297
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,799
Are you the person in charge?

298
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,519
Otherwise, we can't see it from here.

299
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,680
Who did this?

300
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,720
What is this?

301
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,200
What is this?

302
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
What is it?

303
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,000
We're opening in three days.

304
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We're opening in three days.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How dare you give this to me?

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,039
Leave now!

307
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,410
Your commission for this month will be deducted!

308
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,890
Get lost!

309
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,359
Come on. Let's look over there.

310
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:39,839
Come on.

311
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,960
Let's eat.

312
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Get back to work after you eat.

313
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
All right.

314
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,650
You're back.

315
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,039
How did it go? Is the deal sealed?

316
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,410
I'm starving.

317
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,759
I haven't eaten all night.

318
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,279
They didn't provide food? Slow down.

319
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,359
You can't starve just because you want to save money.

320
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,559
Don't choke yourself.

321
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,119
Mr. Tian, is there any food in the kitchen?

322
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,720
Slow down.

323
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,960
So what's the situation?

324
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,519
I didn't even see him.

325
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
The person in charge ran away.

326
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,599
Can we sue him?

327
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,599
Isn't that a scam?

328
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,039
Why should I sue?

329
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,279
Who should I sue?

330
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,519
Even the company didn't sue him.

331
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,519
Who am I to sue him?

332
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,279
Should I sue him for making me go to Shenzhen twice?

333
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,519
That's true.

334
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,200
It won't be easy to sue him.

335
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,680
Your job...

336
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
seems easy...

337
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,890
but you'd better off doing business like me, right?

338
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,119
Set up a small restaurant...

339
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,890
and earn an honest living.

340
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,170
You'll never suffer losses.

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,079
Is your restaurant still hiring?

342
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,119
I'll wash your dishes,

343
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,170
mop the floor or something.

344
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,000
No, Mr. Hou, please spare me.

345
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,890
My dishes are expensive.

346
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,720
Eat your food. There's enough for you.

347
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,759
You're stingy. I can't rely on you.

348
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,170
Hello.

349
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Yes.

350
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm always ready.

351
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,839
Okay.

352
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,559
Okay, thank you.

353
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,480
What is going on?

354
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,319
The night school called me.

355
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,200
That must be Shi Yi's doing.

356
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,680
Her friend quit.

357
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,519
They want me to teach there.

358
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,079
So that's a job.

359
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,480
Congratulations on getting a job.

360
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,319
Should I give you two pieces of meat?

361
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,799
Add an egg.

362
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,359
It's too plain.

363
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,359
Mr. Tian.

364
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,599
Are there any eggs left?

365
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,400
Hello? Who is it?

366
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,319
Yes, I am.

367
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,400
Hello, Mr. Ma.

368
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,799
Have a seat.

369
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,759
Tian Min's mom...

370
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
asked us to handle her funeral.

371
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,119
After burying his daughter,

372
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,440
she went back to Canada.

373
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,039
When she was here,

374
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,720
everything reminded her of Tian Min.

375
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,359
I want to know how she died.

376
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,400
She attended a charity event.

377
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,319
When she was sending books to underprivileged children,

378
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,000
she ran into a landslide on the way.

379
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,640
She died while trying to save someone else.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,359
Can you say that again?

381
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,400
She died while trying to save someone else.

382
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,599
What a kind person.

383
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
That's too bad.

384
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,000
It's some of Tian Min's belonging.

385
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,119
There's a diary.

386
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,079
There's a lot about you in there.

387
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,200
Tian Min's mom thought...

388
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
you should keep it.

389
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,279
Thank you.

390
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,079
Where's the cemetery?

391
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,559
Tian Min!

392
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,160
It's my fault.

393
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm sorry, Tian Min.

397
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,000
do you still remember...

398
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,359
the noodle house we always go to?

399
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,720
It still tastes the same.

400
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,640
I miss the old days.

401
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,119

403
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,559
Today, while I was waiting for the bus,

404
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,079
I played a game.

405
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,319
If the number of passengers that come down is an even number,

406
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,839
it means you had the conscience to stop at the right time.

407
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,759
If it's an odd number,

408
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,599
it means you still haven't come to your senses.

409
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm so glad it's even.

411

Ma Yong, your birthday is coming up.

But tomorrow,

413
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm going to meet the kids in the mountains.

414
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,000
Helping people...

415
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,559
makes me feel at peace.

416
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,519
Let me make up for your sins.

417
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,720
See you at the old banyan tree at 7pm tonight.

how much food is left for today?

- Okay. - Ask him.

00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay.

426
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,599
Sorry, we're closed.

I don't know.

Aren't they together?

434

They're not together.

Ten backstraps.

442

Five kidneys.

You're not well.

448
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,480
Let's not drink that much.

449
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,319
It's not about being healthy.

450
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,119
It's only once a year.

451
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,160
Drink.

452
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,200
Open it.

453
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,599
Open it.

Mr. Hou, you're too kind.

I can't accept it.

458
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,680
You're 36 years old. It's your year of fate.

459
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,079
Am I right?

460
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,319
Take it.

461

I really can't accept it, Mr. Hou.

462

I must not take it.

463
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,519
Why bother?

464
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,440
No matter how valuable this is,

465
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,440
it is nothing compared to your contributions to the company.

466
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,680
It's nothing.

467
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,559
Your year of fate doesn't come by every year.

468
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,319
If your year of fate comes by every year,

469
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,680
I really can't afford it.

470
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,920
Just take it.

471
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,480

can't give you a life of luxury.

Thank you.

But I can provide you with food and a roof over your head.

477
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,200
It has been 14 years.

478
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,000
I mean, you've been in the company for 14 years.

479
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,559
It's actually 13 years and 7 months.

480
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,759
I always remember.

481
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay.

482
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,680
It's 13 years and 7 months.

483
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,000
Do you still remember...

484
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,200
when you first came to the office,

485
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,799
the company was facing a huge trouble...

486
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,000
at that time.

487
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,680
I held you captive in my office on your first day of work.

488
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,039
I told you,

489
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,119
from now on, you can't go anywhere.

490
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,119
You have to live in the office.

491
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,640
Do you still remember?

492
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,519
And I just kept yelling at you.

493
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,359
In the end, the company won the bid.

494
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,559
It was the hardest time for the company.

495
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,839
We've finally gotten over this.

496
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,119
I had no choice.

497
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,640
I was so stressed.

498
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,799
You should know.

499
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,920
If we didn't win...

500
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,720
for that big project,

501
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,319
I would lose the company.

502
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,920
But luckily,

503
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,279
we won the tender.

504
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,920
All thanks to you, my right hand.

505
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,519
So we won.

506
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,559
And I said...

507
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,559
it's his first day at work.

508
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,799
He might not know anything about this industry...

509
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
But he's diligent.

510
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
He doesn't mind enduring hardship.

511
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,640
On top of that, he is smart.

512
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,920
He's a promising man.

513
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:13,769
I must make use of him.

514
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,079
After winning that tender,

515
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,079
the company had finally gone to the next level.

516
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,289
Do you still remember?

517
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:26,000
When we won the bid,

518
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,639
there were only a few people in our company.

519
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,769
We came here.

520
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,159
We sat right here...

521
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,920
and had a feast.

522
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,329
But since then,

523
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,480
we had never came back.

524
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,039
It's still the same.

525
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,119
There's not much that has changed.

526
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,719
The owner has changed twice.

527
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,000
Things have changed.

528
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,159
You've been busy.

529
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,289
You didn't have the time to come here.

530
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,840
Sometimes,

531
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,440
I secretly make time to come here.

532
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,199
You're still very sentimental.

533
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
That's good.

534
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,519
You're the same.

535
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,480
Here.

536
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,519
Let's drink to that.

537
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,440
Happy birthday.

538
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,559
Thank you.

539
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,679
Slow down.

540
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,039
It's okay.

541
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,289
It's okay.

542
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,679
It's good wine...

543
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,000
but it's too much for my body.

544
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,599
Right now,

545
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,039
I can't eat much.

546
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,360
I can't even drink.

547
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,079
My body is getting weaker day by day.

548
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,599
But my brain...

549
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:22,960
is still conscious.

550
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,599
In my head,

551
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,079
I only remember the past...

552
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,239
when we were fighting together.

553
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,119
They don't go away.

554
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,000
You were right, my friend.

555
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,239
Things have changed.

556
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,519
Look at the company.

557
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,519
From a few people,

558
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
we grew into a team of 10,

559
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,960
a team of almost 100 of people,

560
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,840
and eventually hundreds of people.

561
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,809
We kept expanding.

562
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,400
We were making more and more money.

563
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,199
But deep down,

564
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,559
I feel empty.

565
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
The energy from the past...

566
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,809
is gone.

567
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:31,159
I don't know where it is.

568
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,719
I'm still sitting here.

569
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:41,480
Yes.

570
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,119
You're the only one.

571
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,519
Over the years,

572
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,159
you're the only one who stays...

573
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,559
and called me your friend.

574
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,599
I want someone I can talk to honestly.

575
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,079
And you're the only one.

576
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:44,840
Why are you here?

577
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,809
Why did you lie?

578
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,000
I...

579
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,880
About what?

580
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,329
Hai Xing told me everything.

581
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,119
The contract doesn't exist.

582
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,639
Chen Chen didn't contact you either.

583
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,289
You're a night-school substitute.

584
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes.

585
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,809
I...

586
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,329
I want you to focus on your work.

587
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:22,039
I want you to live well.

588
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,360
I don't want...

589
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,639
to affect your career...

590
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,519
and your private life...

591
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,840
due to my personal reasons.

592
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,480
So...

593
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,880
So you made this decision without me knowing.

594
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm sorry.

595
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm afraid I'll hold you back.

596
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,039
Well...

597
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,199
Look at this.

598
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,679
Where did you get it?

599
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,239
Isn't this my design?

600
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Are you sure?

601
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,719
That's right.

602
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,360
In this plan,

603
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,079
I wrote something that only I know about.

604
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:18,599
This is the design plan of the Book Bar...

605
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,840
at South Bay Resort.

606
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,719
I think I've seen it somewhere.

607
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:22,840
So...

608
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,329
I came here to show it to you.

609
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,440
The plan is from the Hedgehog Factory.

610
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,199
The designer's name is Zhang Sheng.

611
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,039
I've checked.

612
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,329
It's a new company.

613
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,769
Zhang Sheng is not a shareholder.

614
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:34,239
He's not a legal representative either.

615
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,809
I guess he took the proposal...

616
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,599
and sold it to Hedgehog Factory.

617
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,360
Zhang Sheng?

618
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,809
No wonder I haven't been able to find him.

619
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,599
He scammed me for my design.
