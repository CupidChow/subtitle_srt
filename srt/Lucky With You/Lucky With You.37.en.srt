4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,120
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

5
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,079
Thank you for telling me this today.

6
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,239
If you hadn't told me,

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,519
perhaps one day,

8
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,640
I would probably go to my grave...

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,359
without knowing...

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,370
how wrong I was.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,479
I was really wrong.

12
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
Yu Jie.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
After all these years,

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,530
I finally plucked up my courage...

15
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,319
for the first time...

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,719
to call you Yu Jie.

17
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,120
I remember,

18
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,560
when we first got married,

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,080
I bought you the white outfit...

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,479
in this painting.

21
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,439
Do you remember?

22
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,439
I kept this painting of yours in the basement of my villa...

23
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,479
because I was too scared to face this moment.

24
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,159
I can't face you.

25
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Yu Jie.

26
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,840
If I didn't argue with you back then,

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,520
you wouldn't have run away with our son.

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,439
You also wouldn't have...

29
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,520
fallen into the water in the car.

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,120
If I acted like a real man...

31
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
and went to hug and embrace you,

32
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,319
nothing would have happened.

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
Yu Jie...

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,960
It's all my fault.

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,879
I let you and our son down.

36
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,439
My life...

37
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,599
is only full of regrets.

38
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,680
I've let everyone down.

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
I thought everything I did was right.

40
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,879
But now, it looks like...

41
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,879
everything I did...

42
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,279
was all wrong.

43
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,279
It was all wrong.

44
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,279
Don't be sad.

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
All right.

46
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,610
Get up.

47
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,959
I misunderstood my dad this whole time.

48
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,800
Why do you say that?

49
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,079
He actually loved my mom very much.

50
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,600
He loves you very much too.

51
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,240
Mr. Hou, it's time to eat.

52
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,079
I'm coming.

53
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,399
Did you not call Hou Jue?

54
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
He...

55
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,519
Come on. Don't worry.

56
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,000
You'll know once you sit down.

57
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,480
Come, sit down.

58
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,279
Why is he in the kitchen?

59
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,800
You'll see.

60
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,519
Be careful.

61
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,439
Guess what this is.

62
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,920
What are you guys up to?

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
Open it.

64
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,560
Your son personally made this for you.

65
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,160
All right, let me do it.

66
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,879
Here, that's enough. I'll do it.

67
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
This braised pork belly smells good.

68
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,680
My son knows braised pork belly is my favorite.

69
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,759
Here, let's eat.

70
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
I have to eat this sparingly.

71
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,839
Hou Jue.

72
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,439
Actually, I fed you when you were very young.

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,639
Let me feed you again today.

74
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,839
There are only a few pieces. There's no more.

75
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,600
You can only eat this once a week.

76
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
Leave the fatty parts for me.

77
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
You can eat the lean meat.

78
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,439
- Won't you be upset? - Not at all.

79
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,120
Then here I go.

80
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,079
It's not so good this time.

81
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,879
I didn't do a good job.

82
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not bad. It's already pretty good.

83
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
- Here. - Come on, let's eat.

84
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,839
It's good, right?

85
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,680
We usually teach in small groups here.

86
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,240
In order to guarantee the quality of learning,

87
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,079
there are a maximum of six students in each class.

88
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,639
Our instructors are all excellent.

89
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,120
They're all professional team retirees.

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,759
Take me for example. Our skills are definitely good.

91
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
We also have private lessons.

92
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,600
We charge by the hour, but it's a little expensive.

93
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,960
Do you not know how to swim at all?

94
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,120
I could when I was young.

95
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,600
I could swim when I was eight.

96
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,330
It's okay.

97
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,279
Give it a try. Don't be afraid.

98
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,679
Don't be like a baby.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No, buddy.

100
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,759
Are you playing with the water?

101
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,360
You must really be afraid of water.

102
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Come on.

103
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,759
Just don't torture yourself.

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,679
No. I like to torture myself.

105
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I like that.

106
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,720
Actually, the water isn't scary.

107
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,799
The only fear...

108
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,960
is fear itself.

109
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,799
Come on, beat it. Try again.

110
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,919
You can do it.

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,519
What is it this time?

112
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,279
I think this fear...

113
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,090
is too terrifying.

114
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,879
Forget it. I'll try next time.

115
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,600
Next time?

116
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Take care.

117
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Hello.

118
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,240
How was your day today?

119
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,200
Not bad.

120
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,559
I wanted to learn to swim, but I was still too afraid.

121
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,639
Why do you suddenly want to learn how to swim?

122
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,639
There's no misunderstanding anymore, right?

123
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,679
And it's embarrassing not knowing how to swim.

124
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,720
I'm afraid it'll affect future rescue missions in the water.

125
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,679
Don't rush. Take it slow.

126
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,639
This kind of fear can't go away in a mere day or two.

127
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,480
Yes, so I'm slowly getting rid of it now.

128
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,080
How about this?

129
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
Call me your teacher. I'll teach you.

130
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
You'll teach me?

131
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,080
You should have told me earlier.

132
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,679
We'll start tomorrow then.

133
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,279
Go and prepare a nice swimsuit.

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,840
Who said I have to wear a swimsuit to teach you swimming?

135
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,320
Then what will you wear?

136
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,919
We'll see.

137
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,919
- Hello? - Hello?

138
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,399
Hello, can you hear me?

139
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,919
Hello?

140
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,240
What's wrong with this phone?

141
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,120
Why are you being so mysterious?

142
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,080
I want to talk to you.

143
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
I feel upset.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,559
Hey, what's wrong?

145
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
I have a question.

146
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,080
Tell me.

147
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,320
There's a person...

148
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,399
who hurt you,

149
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
but you still like him.

150
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,200
What would you do?

151
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,960
No way. Do you love him that much?

152
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,600
But he doesn't want to marry you.

153
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,480
However,

154
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,879
a lot of things are changing.

155
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,519
For example, Hou Jue and his dad...

156
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,159
are getting along now.

157
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,080
So...

158
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,600
it's hard to say.

159
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,679
Is it because his dad fell ill?

160
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,559
Maybe.

161
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,840
After he fell ill, it seems like they've both changed.

162
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,039
Now, they have to fight together...

163
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,240
or the company may go bankrupt.

164
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,759
Bankrupt?

165
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,480
Shi Yi.

166
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,000
That's all for now.

167
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,080
- I have something to do. Bye. - I...

168
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
Why is she so strange?

169
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,279
(Old Man)

00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,279
Why did you ask me to come so urgently?

171
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,519
I heard about what happened to you.

172
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,960
Why didn't you tell me?

173
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,399
I...

174
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,360
Are you talking about me getting hospitalized?

175
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,279
I've already been discharged.

176
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,840
Look how healthy I am.

177
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm talking about your company.

178
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,159
That...

179
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,840
That has passed too.

180
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,759
Initially,

181
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,360
all I thought about was work, day in and day out.

182
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
But It's great now.

183
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,519
I just eat and sleep every day.

184
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,480
I even enjoy a warm shower at night.

185
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,879
Things are good.

186
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,519
I don't want to have to hear about you...

187
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,919
from other people.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
I want to go back to how we used to be.

189
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Qian Qian.

190
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,360
It's all in the past.

191
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,919
We can't go back to how we used to be.

192
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,039
Old man.

193
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,120
Qian Qian, don't call me "old man" anymore, okay?

194
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,039
Don't call me that anymore.

195
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,320
I've healed a bit now.

196
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,360
I don't want to think about the past anymore.

197
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,679
Isn't Hai Xing a nice guy?

198
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
He's young...

199
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,159
and he's devoted to you.

200
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,320
You should cherish him.

201
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,650
I've already clearly rejected him.

202
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,480
It's not possible between us.

203
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,440
It's the same for us.

204
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,480
If there's nothing else,

205
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,279
I'll get going.

206
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,599
Don't go.

207
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,279
Qian Qian.

208
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,039
You still have a long future ahead of you.

209
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,170
You deserve a better life.

210
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,519
My life won't be better off without you.

211
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,680
Qian Qian, I'm old now.

212
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,359
I have nothing.

213
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,960
I have no money.

214
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,240
What's the point of being with me?

215
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,650
If we keep going,

216
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll only drag you down with me and be a burden to you.

217
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,650
And I definitely won't allow myself to do this.

218
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
You're not a burden to me.

219
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,119
I can do everything.

220
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,480
I can take care of you.

221
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,359
I...

222
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,000
Compared to the old Mr. Hou,

223
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,720
I...

224
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,240
I love the current you even more.

225
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,839
You know how to do everything.

226
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,319
You're currently living an idealistic life.

227
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,480
I'm living in reality.

228
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,960
I know how harsh reality is.

229
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,650
If you continue being with me,

230
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,480
you'll have to face a lot of pressure.

231
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,680
When I had money, I had confidence.

232
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
But I have nothing now.

233
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,200
Your old man has no confidence now.

234
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,039
Let me ask you one more thing.

235
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,960
How will you explain this to your parents?

236
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,799
Your parents don't know about my situation right now.

237
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,599
How will you explain this to your friends?

238
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,359
Tell me. How will you explain it?

239
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,759
I don't care what other people think.

240
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,079
I care.

241
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,440
I care. I can't do this anymore.

242
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,279
I just want to live the rest of my life in peace now.

243
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,559
I swore to the heavens...

244
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,119
that in my next life,

245
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,200
I have to meet this girl again.

246
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,200
I have to meet her 20 years earlier.

247
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,890
My seat belt.

248
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,170
Promise me.

249
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,200
Don't leave me.

250
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,119
Okay?

251
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,920
When I think of what might happen...

252
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,440
If something goes wrong and something happens to you,

253
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,039
what will I do?

254
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,319
I'll be alone. I have heart disease.

255
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,650
I won't be able to take it.

256
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,279
Speed up! What are you doing?

257
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,839
You guys at the front, hurry!

258
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,920
One, two, one.

259
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,400
One, two, one.

260
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,880
The second one, catch up!

261
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,640
Seventy-seven.

262
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,799
Hang in there! What are you doing?

263
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,880
Seventy-eight.

264
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,279
Seventy-nine.

265
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Eighty.

266
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Eighty-two.

267
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Eighty-six.

268
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,839
Ninety-six. Do it again!

269
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,920
Ninety-six!

270
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
I won't fall for your trick.

271
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,480
Hello, the number you've dialed is busy.

272
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,559
Please try again later.

273
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,880
Why didn't you answer your phone?

274
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm working. I can't talk right now.

275
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,200
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

276
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,880
Hello, Mr. Hou.

277
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,359
I wanted to ask you something.

278
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Go ahead.

279
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,480
What is Shi Yi doing lately?

280
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,440
I think she's on vacation.

281
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,119
But I think...

282
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,920
she's actually by your side, secretly protecting you.

283
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,680
By my side? What do you mean?

284
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,720
Shi Yi is worried that Liu Tie Hao won't stop.

285
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,079
And Zhou Quan was dismissed.

286
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,000
What do you think I mean?

287
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,279
Mr. Hou.

288
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,960
All right. Forget I said anything.

289
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,079
I'm hanging up.

290
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,079
He left me hanging.

291
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,000
She's actually by your side, secretly protecting you.

292
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,559
By my side?

293
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,200
Why are you in such a rush?

294
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,960
Why are you spying on me?

295
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,759
How did you know I was here?

296
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,400
I have my sources.

297
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
How much did you offer to Mr. Zhao?

298
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,839
I bought an island for Mr. Zhao.

299
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,160
Cut the crap.

300
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,640
Wait. I'll come over.

301
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,720
Don't come.

302
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,720
If you do, what I'm doing will become meaningless.

303
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,720
I don't think...

304
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Liu Tie Hao will let you off so easily.

305
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,880
You have no idea how crazy a gambling addict can be...

306
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,079
when he's desperate.

307
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:11,640
What are you afraid of? Just call the police.

308
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,799
We don't have any evidence to report this right now.

309
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,039
If he knows I'm protecting you,

310
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,279
he definitely won't show up.

311
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,880
I don't want to let this villain off the hook.

312
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,400
That's why.

313
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
I want to come and see you.

314
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,079
Why are you so worried?

315
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,119
I won't be worried after this is solved.

316
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,880
I can't let you solve this so easily then.

317
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Hou Jue.

318
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,039
This nutritious meal of yours really does work.

319
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,319
Yes.

320
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,759
My blood lipids haven't gone up...

321
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,960
after having them these few days.

322
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,799
Yes, eating vegetarian food is great.

323
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
But I still think it's okay...

324
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,079
to eat meat once in a while.

325
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,200
- Fine. - Isn't that right?

326
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,559
I'll make some for you when you've recovered.

327
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,200
Eat your food, Hou Jue. Stop playing with your phone.

328
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,720
That's right. Come on, eat up.

329
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,359
- I'm done. I'm not eating anymore. - Here.

330
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,839
Are you not eating?

331
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,920
What do you mean you're done? You haven't even eaten yet.

332
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,480
- That's right. - Hou Jue.

333
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,480
- This kid. - Look at him. Gosh.

334
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,559
Who is it?

335
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,039
- Hello. - Hello, this is your delivery.

336
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I didn't order anything.

337
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,720
Are you Ms. Wu?

338
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,440
I am.

339
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,000
That's right then. This is yours.

340
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Thank you.

341
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,759
Enjoy your meal.

342
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,720
Extra spicy, less salt, and be on time.

343
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,279
The receiver is hot-tempered and skilled in martial arts.

344
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,799
The delivery guy must be careful.

345
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,160
She has more strength than you can imagine.

346
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Hello.

347
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,759
Is the food good?

348
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,440
Your seductive dance was too good...

349
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,599
that I forgot to eat.

350
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,160
If I don't get to watch a seductive dance from now on,

351
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,200
I'll starve myself.

352
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,480
You wish.

353
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,440
I've prepared...

354
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
another special program.

355
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,119
What are you doing?

356
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Turn around.

357
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
Close your eyes.

358
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,599
Don't look back until I call you.

359
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,079
Okay, I'll turn around.

360
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,079
Are you putting on sticky notes?

361
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,200
It looks a lot like a heart.

362
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,319
But the heart seems a bit fat.

363
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,039
Are you done?

364
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,680
All right, turn around.

365
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,799
Does it say 102?

366
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Does it say 201?

367
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,079
It can't be 120, can it?

368
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,880
I flipped it.

369
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,640
Wait for me. I'll do it again.

370
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,680
I'll fix it.

371
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,119
Why don't you just tell me what you're trying to make?

372
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,799
Hou Jue.

373
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,359
What are you doing?

374
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
I...

375
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,880
I'm making a picture.

376
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
A picture?

377
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,079
I understand.

378
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,119
Good job.

379
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,279
You can do it.

380
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,559
You haven't finished eating.

381
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,880
Come and eat after you're done.

382
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,839
Welcome.

383
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,039
Welcome.

384
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,039
Here.

385
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,319
- Miss, welcome. - No, thank you.

(Li Xiang Fan Concert, March 16 at Linglong Tower Theater)

387
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
Let's go.

388
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,160
Hello, my dear daughter.

389
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:47,759
Your mom's favorite singer, Li Xiang, the Prince of Ballads,

390
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,119
is holding a fan concert again.

391
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,079
This might be the last time.

392
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,000
If your mom doesn't go,

393
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,920
she'll regret it for the rest of her life.

394
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,119
If a middle-aged woman...

395
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,079
goes to watch the Prince of Ballads by herself,

396
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,880
people will ridicule her saying she's desperate for love.

397
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,159
I'll go with her to keep her company.

398
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,639
I'll buy the tickets for her.

399
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,119
She won't have a reason to say no.

400
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,719
But...

401
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,519
I don't have the money.

402
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,519
Five hundred?

403
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
That's enough.

404
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,360
Nothing is easy.

(Miss You, Back to the Summer, Li Xiang Fan Concert)

The joy you bring me, the way you make my heart race

407
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,769
I'll run away with you

408
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,809
You say someone you love

409
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:50,039
Is dancing in the wind and rain

410

The joy you bring me, the way you make my heart race

Thank you.

414
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,329
A week ago,

415
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,000
a gentleman came to me.

416
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,559
He told me...

417
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,679
there's a beautiful lady...

418
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,679
who has always been a big fan of ours...

419
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,480
ever since our debut.

420
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,199
That has never changed for over 20 years.

421
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:30,559
And he has also never stopped loving this woman.

422
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,159
As requested by this man,

423
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,159
we're going to sing a song...

424
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,039
that he wrote...

425
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:41,039
for his loved one.

426
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,079
It's called "Unintentional Mistakes".

427
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,599
At the same time, through this song,

428
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,960
we want to tell all our fans who support us...

429
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:52,039
that we are lucky to have met you all.

430
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:54,400
It's the luckiest thing ever.

431
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Thank you.

432
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,519
A night of solitude is so lonely

433
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,239
Sitting alone in that corner by the window

434
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,840
Blankly staring at the lights outside the window

435
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,519
Before I knew it...

436
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:34,039
If I could turn back time to the moment before my mistakes

437
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,599
I'll do it properly again

438
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,840
Mr. Wu.

439
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,159
If I'm not mistaken,

440
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:56,769

441

is the one you love, right?

Now, in the presence of everyone here,

443
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,880
I would like to invite you...

444
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,599
to give this bouquet of flowers...

445
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,480
to the woman you love, okay?

446
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,809
- Great! - Good!

Thank you. Thank you, Li Xiang.

448
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,400
- Great! - Awesome!

449
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,880
I didn't face my unintentional mistakes

450
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,920
And made myself suffer

451
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,119
I didn't face my unintentional mistakes

452
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,079
I was afraid I would miss out

453
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:46,289
If I could turn back time

454
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,360
To the moment before my mistakes

455
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,769
I'll do it...

456
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Dad.

457
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,159
You're up.

458
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:10,400
- What are you doing? - Come and have breakfast.

459
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,960
Hou Jue, here.

460
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,880
Here's your porridge.

461
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:18,440
Why do you look so down?

462
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,960
Did you stay up all night again?

463
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,519
No, I didn't.

464
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,000
I just didn't sleep well.

465
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,920
What do you mean?

466
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,769
Listen, young people shouldn't stay up so late.

467
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,119
When I was young, I stayed up late for work too frequently.

468
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,329
Look at how many health problems I have now.

469
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,559
I lost more than I gained.

470
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,920
Don't worry, Dad. I'm perfectly healthy.

471
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,239
Hou Jue, look.

472
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,809
I bought a second-hand film camera.

473
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,679
It's over 1,000 yuan.

474
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,809
Are you planning to be a collector?

475
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,400
I've loved photography ever since I was young.

476
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,159
When you were born, I said,

477
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,480
I would take photos with you every day.

478
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,159
Now,

479
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,880
I can't even pick you up anymore.

480
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,769
And I didn't take a single photo.

481
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,360
It's time to pick up this hobby again.

482
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,679
Right, Dad.

483
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,519
Let me briefly tell you...

484
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,289
about the company's current situation.

485
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,159
Don't tell me about that.

486
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,769
I've left the company to you.

487
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Okay.

488
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,400
Were you going to tell me...

489
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,239
about the aftermath of the company's troubles?

490
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,920
That's related to me. Tell me.

491
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:40,159
I've already paid everyone's severance pay.

492
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,079
According to the contract,

493
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,039
we have to give three month's salary to every employee.

494
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,639
I gave them an extra month.

495
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,960
The entire company is under renovation now.

496
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,440
Apart from the Design Department,

497
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,119
I've rented out the other offices.

498
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:54,559
We don't need such a big space.

499
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,119
Also, I found a few small projects...

500
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:00,079
that were up for bidding.

501
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm working on the proposals for that.

502
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:03,239
You sure are generous.

503
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,960
You even paid them an extra month's salary.

504
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,599
Don't talk about work while eating.

505
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,769
- All right. - It'll affect your digestion.

506
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:09,769
We won't talk about it anymore.

507
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,920
Look. The company is in your hands now.

508
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,599
From now on, I won't get involved with anything.

509
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,039
Didn't you say you'd stop talking about work?

510
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,880
Okay. Ms. Zhang, let me say one last thing.

511
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,239
Fine. Go on.

512
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,119
I've sold one of my villas.

513
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,639
After I get the money,

514
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,440
use it as a backup fund for the company.

515
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,599
All right?

516
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,199
Do your best, Hou Jue.

517
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:29,809
Okay.

518
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,000
Who is it? Coming.

519
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,159
- Open the door. - Who is it?

520
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm coming.

521
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
It's Mr. Zhang.

522
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
- Good morning, Ms. Zhang. - Come.

523
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,599
Come on in.

524
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,920
- Have you eaten? - Yes.

525
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,679
- I ate in the car. - Here, change your shoes.

526
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,920
Okay, thank you.

527
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,159
I'm here to see Mr. Hou.

528
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:49,599
- Are you looking for me? - No.

529
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,360
I'm looking for Mr. Hou Junior.

530
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,239
You...

531
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:57,289
From now on, call him Mr. Hou and call me Uncle Hou.

532
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,519
That way, you can differentiate us.

533
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,599
Call me Monkey.

534
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,639
Don't be so rude.

535
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,119
Dad, you eat.

536
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,480
- I'll go talk to him. - Go.

537
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,719
- Let's go to the study. Come on. - Okay.

538
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,519
- Here, this room. - Okay.

539
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,039
I've found all of Wu Tian Yi's creditors.

540
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,329
They've agreed to transfer the debt to you.

541
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,519
You just need to find the debtors...

542
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,480
and have them sign a third-party agreement.

543
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,559
Then you just need to get it notarized.

544
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,199
All right.

545
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,360
That's great. I was afraid they wouldn't agree.

546
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,119
Things are a lot easier as long as they agree.

547
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,840
Here's the debt transfer agreement that I drafted.

548
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Take a look at it first.

549
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,519
Okay.

550
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:42,679
- I just need to sign it, right? - Yes.

551
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,880
Here, Mr. Hou. Have some water.

552
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,559
Look.

553
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,039
Actually, Hou Jue may like to fool around,

554
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,920
but he's quite diligent when it comes to crucial moments.

555
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,000
- That seems to be true. - Yes.

556
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,440
So don't be too anxious.

557
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,920
Yes, he has grown up.

558
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,679
I should really let go.

559
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,000
Yes,

560
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,239
you should let go when it's necessary.
