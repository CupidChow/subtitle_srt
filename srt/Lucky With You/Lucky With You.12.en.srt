What kind of hobby is this?

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,640
What are you doing?

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,210
Calling the police.

21
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,970
Hello, Officer. This is Wu Shiyi.

22
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,220
Something has happened here. Please come over, okay?

23
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,320
It's next to Qilin Li. Turn down Number 2 Alley.

24
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,740
That's right.

25
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,430
Okay, then. I'll wait for you here.

26
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,880
Bye-bye.

27
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,900
- Are you finished? <br> - Yes.

28
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,690
Thank you for cooperating with us.

29
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,490
These items are very important.

30
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,500
If you discover anything else like this, please notify us immediately and we'll come to collect the evidence.

31
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,880
- Okay. <br> - Good work.

32
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
- Thank you. <br> - Well done.

33
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,270
Captain Hao, We've finished gathering evidence.

34
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,170
You've finished collecting evidence? Then, gather the officers.

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,520
Officers, let's go.

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,930
Okay, let's go too.

37
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,660
Leave?

38
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,050
How can that wig be considered evidence?

39
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,200
Did someone wear a wig and steal the necklace?

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
That can't be totally confirmed at this point.

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,630
How did you think of rifling through the garbage cans?

42
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,040
That main street with the restaurant all have security cameras. Whether you're driving or in a cab, it's very easy to trace.

43
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,340
This road isn't the same.There aren't cameras on this little road.

44
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,200
It's great from escaping.

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,450
I just guessed that it was a possibility.

46
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,530
I can't believe I actually found something.

47
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,230
Your investigative senses are very strong.

48
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,530
This is very basic.

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
Hello.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,550
Where are you? I am brining Zhou Quan over to take your role.

51
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,440
Go to Hou Jue's house. We'll head there now.

52
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,610
How can we encounter this type of situation; I'm actually speechless. I won't talk more; I'll drive.

53
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,030
I'm hanging up.

54
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,430
Why are they going to my house?

55
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,560
Someone new is replacing me.

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
Why so fast?

57
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,260
That's the rule. Let's go.

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,490
What kind of rule is that?

59
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,470
What is this. It's so unfair.

60
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,040
I didn't make the decision for you to come. You leave, and I still can't make that decision?

61
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,000
None of us can make these decisions. This is my job.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,550
What kind of job is this?

63
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,580
Couldn't they be a little more reliable?

64
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,140
When I don't want anyone, they provide one.

65
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,150
I've just gotten used to it and they send you away. Is this a joke? Are they messing around?

66
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,030
This isn't fair!

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,560
True. It's not fair.

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,130
But, it will be fair sooner or later.

69
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,110
Whether it comes or not, I feel bad right now; it's not fair.

70
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,860
It's not fair!

71
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,730
Enough. I didn't even say anything.

72
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,760
Is it fun?

73
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,490
Hello. You're home.

74
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't worry. Giving you such an expensive necklace means it's okay.

75
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,690
I don't dare even touch it.

76
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,690
How's it going? Reached the objective?

77
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,200
It's going okay. Anyway, she's been recalled to the company.

78
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,450
<i> But I keep thinking that it seems like Hou Jue is suspicious about me. </i>

79
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,880
Sister, do dyou think the way you fixed up this house was too obvious. So he's figured it out?

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,100
Don't overthink this, okay?

81
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,350
How could he be suspicious of you?

82
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,270
Again, even if he does suspect you; is there any proof?

83
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,300
I don't think your rich boyfriend is not on your side.

84
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,270
I figure that you underestimate the relationship between him and that bodyguard of his.

85
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,680
But, as to this matter...

86
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,730
what if...if it gets exposed,

87
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,750
then Hou Jue will surely have nothing to do with me.

88
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,050
But, if I hadn't had that woman recalled,

89
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,340
what I was afraid of is that someday

90
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,490
she might have gotten rid of me.

91
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,780
Could you not spend time thinking of such useless things.

92
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm busy on this end too. I'll say goodbye. You just hang tight there.

93
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,370
I'll hang up. Bye-bye.

94
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,850
Then, okay. Go on.

95
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,320
Expensive things are different.

96
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,630
Why is this so difficult?

97
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
<i> Hey, Shiyi. </i>

98
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,520
<i> How can they just say the word and you're gone? </i>

99
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
The company will arrange for someone else to replace me.

100
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,150
Don't worry. All his people are very professional; they're outstanding characters.

101
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,770
That's not okay. No, no. I won't let you go.

102
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,020
I really won't let you go.

103
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,980
Sister Zhang, I'll come back.

104
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,520
Tell me. What kind of company is it?

105
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,040
When an employee suffers, they don't take responsibility.

106
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,850
Why are they punishing their own people?

107
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,070
Our company is very good.

108
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,080
It's just routine business.

109
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,050
How about I go be a witness for you.

110
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,630
I'll go be a witness. I'll be a character witness for you.

111
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,260
Thank you, Sister Zhang.

112
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,480
Don't worry. The police will definitely clarify all this and verify my innocence.

113
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,870
If you miss me, you can give me a call.

114
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,110
We can even do video calls.

115
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,180
No. I don't want to watch videos.

116
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,750
I want you around every day.

117
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,470
How about you come with me? We don't need him.

118
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,700
No. You two...I don't want to do without either of you.

119
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,710
Uh...I...

120
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,220
They're here. I need to go down.

121
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
Really, don't go. You...

122
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,250
Wait here. I have to get something.

123
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,430
Remember to come back and see me.

124
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,540
I'll be back to see you in a couple days.

125
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,610
You say a couple days, but who knows when you'll be able to come.

126
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,040
I'll come back when I have free time.

127
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,420
I've always loved this. It's for you.

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,010
When you look at it, it's the same as looking at me.

129
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,920
What is this?

130
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,200
It does look a lot like you.

131
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,480
Extremely like me.

132
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,250
Thank you. If you're giving it to me, you can't ask for it back?

133
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,120
Who would ask for it back?

134
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,720
I'm off.

135
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,890
I can't bear to lose you.

136
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,700
- Okay. <br> - Let's go. I'll see you off.

137
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,470
I'm off, Sister Zhang. I'll be back to see you.

138
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,850
Hello. I'm Zhou Quan.

139
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,940
I'm taking over Shiyi as you bodyguard.

140
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,480
I know.

141
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,650
I personally do not want anybody to replace her.

142
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,770
Understood.

143
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,390
Then...I'm sorry Shiyi has to be blamed.

144
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,430
I'm here to apologize to you.

145
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,150
Master Hou definitely has an unusual taste.

146
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,870
You managed to find so many "best quality" girlfriends.

147
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm looking forward for the day they bury you alive.

148
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,650
It's shouldn't be far from now.

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,430
I will clear Shiyi's name.

150
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,820
Do you really?

151
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,830
I definitely will.

152
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,290
Zhou Quan, I left you a notebook on the dining table.

153
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,740
It has all the safety reminders of the residence.

154
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,350
Got it.

155
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm heading out.

156
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,610
Director Hou, thank you very much for your support during this period of time.

157
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,650
You don't need to be this formal.

158
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,090
You know I won't get used to this.

159
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,920
This is the company rundown.

160
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,380
Do you have anything personal you want to say?

161
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,240
What do you want me to say?

162
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,190
Like the anger you have been kept inside your heart.

163
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,130
Curse it out. Curse at me.

164
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,390
I will feel much better that way.

165
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,250
Why do I want you to feel better?

166
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,210
Heading out.

167
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,160
Take care.

168
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,080
Look at your serious face, it's scary.

169
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,090
I'm pretty mad. When I saw Hou Jeu just now I wanted to punch him.

170
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,260
What do you think this is?

171
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,280
You can't blame him.

172
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,640
That Feng Lu, why would she do this to you?

173
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,490
Perhaps I heard her speaking on the phone at the wedding studio.

174
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,070
She is going to accompany someone to a trip.

175
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,510
And she is afraid Hou Jeu finds out.

176
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,750
- You didn't tell Hou Jeu?<br>- No.

177
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,030
This is someone's personal matter, it is inappropriate to come from me.

178
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,250
You are trying to be consider and yet she is biting you back.

179
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,440
To be honest, I do understand Feng Lu.

180
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,800
It's not easy to fine a guy like Hou Jeu, and she is afraid of losing him.

181
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,260
What if I told him the truth, what is it going to happen?

182
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,420
But she doesn't know Hou Jeu well enough.

183
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,280
Hou Jeu hates people stirring the pot behind his back.

184
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,830
For the office, if there is anything I could do, please let me know.

185
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,320
My dad is waiting for my money.

186
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,820
All right. Got it.

187
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,760
Food is ready.

188
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,190
Xiao Quan, we will eat first.

189
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,870
It's okay. I will wait for him.

190
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,950
No need. You don't know when he wants to eat.

191
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,970
You must consider here as your own home.

192
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,370
Shiyi stayed here like her own place. Let's go.

193
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,310
Thanks Sister. I think I better wait for him.

194
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,390
Xiao Quan, why would your executives not believe in Shiyi's character?

195
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,760
Sister Zhang, it's not whether they believe her or not.

196
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,810
For our company, they need to find out the truth in order to present an explanation to the client.

197
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,690
For our industry, we cannot have any obscurity on our morality and ethnicity.

198
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,720
But Shiyi has nothing obscured.

199
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,550
I know.

200
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,260
Unlike someone looks beautiful outside

201
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,390
but has a calculated heart.

202
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,990
They could lie at anytime at yet there are people who believed them.

203
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,330
Let's go and eat.

204
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,740
Sister Zhang, this incident is a misunderstanding, don't over think it.

205
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,010
I'm not hungry.

206
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,880
Misunderstanding? Only you consider that as misunderstanding.

207
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,620
She framed Shiyi of stealing the necklace.

208
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,320
I bet the necklace didn't go missing.

209
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,810
She is just not willing to see you and Shiyi being together everyday.

210
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,090
I'm bothered by this. Please stop nagging me.

211
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,310
People said the elderly like us can be scammed easily.

212
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,810
It looks you youngsters are worse.

213
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,160
You take you upon yourself.

214
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,240
When I got up to go to the bathroom with Hou Jeu and Feng Lu,

215
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,540
there was a pregnant woman sat at our 8 o'clock direction,

216
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,480
she went into the bathroom ahead of us.

217
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,150
Also, she left the bathroom before them.

218
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,350
When we returned to the dining room, I checked the surrounding,

219
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,230
the pregnant woman was no longer there.

220
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,280
Everybody else were there. Meaning this pregnant woman didn't return to her seat.

221
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,270
So she left the bathroom and then exited the restaurant right after.

222
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,800
That means the most important thing right now

223
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,300
is to find this fake pregnant woman.

224
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,940
That's right.

225
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,110
I will able to proof my innocence sooner or later.

226
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,140
But to prove Feng Lu is the person who orchestrated this is more difficult.

227
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,470
I don't think it is that difficult.

228
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,300
If we can't investigate, the police can.

229
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,840
Police can use CCTV from the scene to find this fake pregnant woman.

230
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,120
We can then find out the relationship between her and Feng Lu.

231
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,320
It's difficult.

232
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,420
I checked the alley, there are no surveillance cameras.

233
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,300
Also when you walk in further, there are big and small courtyards and backdoors.

234
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,990
Let say if she left the restaurant through the alley

235
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,300
and exited to the next big street. Then there will be CCTV.

236
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,100
But what if she lives at one of the apartment at this street?

237
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,150
Or she has friends over there.

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,180
She stayed for a bit and changed it up and left.

239
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,390
Then, it's more difficult to find.

240
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,600
That's right.

241
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,880
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

242
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,300
Xiao Zhou, you said Shiyi is waiting at the office

243
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,730
for the investigation result.

244
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,690
Will she get paid?

245
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,420
There are basic salary.

246
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,790
But if she wants to earn performance score, she will need to be the trainer assistant.

247
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,600
What trainer assistant?

248
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,000
It's like defensive punchbag.

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,850
So she will be beaten up?

250
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,530
It's not like that.

251
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,550
It's just the meaning.

252
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,440
Will she be in pain?

253
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,680
It's like defense and punch.

254
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,850
What kind of company is that?

255
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,180
Give me your boss' phone number.

256
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,250
I'm going to call him.

257
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,720
I will going to ask him and talk about this situation.

258
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,890
Sister Zhang, it should be me making the call. Don't you worry.

259
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,470
The person who deserves to be punched is not getting punched.

260
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,320
The person who doesn't deserve to be punched is now getting punched.

261
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,050
Can you call your boss?

262
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm going to see him.

263
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,710
Okay.

264
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,670
It's our faux pass in our industry.

265
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,950
If one person is returned by the client due to their integrity behavior,

266
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,680
it will affect the reputation of the entire company.

267
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,170
Also it will affect other team members.

268
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,160
Director Zhao, I didn't do anything that ruin the company's reputation. Please believe me.

269
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,440
I don't need to believe but I never suspected that.

270
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,190
For our client's safety, we can sacrifice our life,

271
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,820
who cares about this petty benefit?

272
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,990
However, according to our company policy,

273
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,870
when someone received complaints from the client,

274
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,020
before investigation completion,

275
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,450
they can't leave the company campus.

276
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,580
Also, you will be assisting other team members to train.

277
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,060
Once the result is out and proved your innocence, then you can go back to work.

278
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,330
Understood.

279
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,390
Sorry to make you suffer.

280
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,110
That's nothing.

281
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,280
Let's go.

282
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,580
Mr. Hou, I have heard a lot about you.

283
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,290
Please take a seat.

284
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,490
Has Shiyi been mentioning about me?

285
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,590
Shiyi didn't mention about you.

286
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,610
Mr. Hou, that's our discipline. We cannot release client's private information.

287
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,680
Don't worry. She really didn't mention anything about you.

288
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,480
That's good. That's good. Your industry should work like that. It's good.

289
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,270
Mr. Hou, what's the purpose of your visit?

290
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,480
That's right. Director Zhao. My visit today is to

291
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,740
have Shiyi resumes her duty at my place.

292
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,760
I want to renew her contract.

293
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,070
The messy incident was a misunderstanding.

294
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,460
I truly believe in Shiyi. I don't think she is the problem.

295
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,440
Mr. Hou, isn't it your girlfriend who reported to the police?

296
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,980
No.We ate out that day.

297
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,530
She is not my girlfriend, just a friend.

298
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,850
Mr. Hou, if you believe in Wu Shiyi,

299
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,660
- I'm glad to hear that. I thank you on her behalf.<br> - Your are welcome.

300
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,460
Can Shiyi be back?

301
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,570
Mr. Hou, I understand your feeling.

302
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,760
But now that your girl...

303
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,860
your friend has already reported to the police.

304
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,850
We will need to wait until the police finished the entire investigation,

305
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,210
in order to resume Wu Shiyi's job.

306
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,210
That's part of our company policy.

307
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,320
What if they cannot conclude the case right away.

308
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,780
What if it takes three or six months has no results?

309
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,930
Then Shiyi will have to wait?

310
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,140
Unless your friend withdraw the case.

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,320
Li Linzhi, step out.

313
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,250
- Hai Xing, come out. <br> - Yes, ma'am.

314
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,430
You hitting her? Try it. Go ahead, train.

315
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,850
- Try and hit her. <br> - Stop it, stop hitting him.

316
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,420
Keep fighting.

317
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,350
- I'll beat you up. <br> - Stop hitting him.

318
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,140
What are you doing?

319
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,470
What is wrong with you?

320
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,130
No, let me explain–

321
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,530
I cannot help it. Coaches ask me to fight with her.

322
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,140
- We are having a class. <br> - It's not okay even in a class.

323
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,610
You cannot hit her. You cannot!

324
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,880
None of you can.

325
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,800
You wait.

326
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,180
Monkey. You've misunderstood.

327
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,980
His heart aches for you.

328
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,770
What? How about my older cousin?

329
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,700
She won't be able to clear her name.

330
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,320
I mean, what if the case is not solved?

331
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,390
Will my older cousin never be able to work again?

332
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,290
I don't think what matters is if she's able to work again.

333
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:38,290
What matters is that wherever she goes, she'll be called a little thief. Who could stand that?

334
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,500
That would be terrible.

335
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,380
- No one could stand that. <br> - I agree.

336
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,650
So today, I thought about what to do.

337
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,790
I went to the bodyguard company

338
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,540
and walked past their training room. It was so cruel.

339
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,110
- They were all fighting her. <br> - Wait wait wait, no.

340
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,120
It was one-on-one. We were all one-by-one. This is very fair.

341
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,440
Oh, really?

342
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,420
One-on-one with everyone in line to fight the same person over and over again.

343
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,560
It was so cruel. I saw the first person

344
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,550
run over, pick her up, and throw her to the ground. And then the second one again, picked her up and threw her to the ground.

345
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,150
The person being thrown to the ground was Shiyi. When I saw that, I–

346
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,610
my heart ached.

347
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:27,410
And then it kept going, and then I saw you were there too. When did you register for classes there?

348
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,470
How could you even lay a hand on her, Hai Xing? Isn't she your older cousin?

349
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,760
I was faking it. I was just acting like I was doing it for real.

350
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,840
You know how close we are. We're family.

351
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,500
I had no other choice. Otherwise, my Qianqian wouldn't be able to carry out her duties.

352
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,060
- Fine, whatever. <br> - How about this, monkey?

353
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,960
Hit me twice. Vent all your frustrations out on me.

354
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,220
Okay.

355
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,010
- Don't move, okay? <br> - Uh, this–

356
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,060
Let me try it a different way.

357
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,220
You've drank too much. This is illegal.

358
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,330
So, what should I do? What do you want to do? I'll accompany you.

359
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,620
I thought about it,

360
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,870
I'm going to register for classes alongside you.

361
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,750
- Huh? <br> - Yes. I'm just going to watch you guys, every day.

362
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,130
I'll just sit there. I'll see which one of you guys dares to lay a hand on Shiyi.

363
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,570
I'll see which one of you dares to hit Shiyi. If you

364
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,990
throw her down once, then I'll go over and teach you a lesson.

365
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,260
Right? And if that doesn't work,

366
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,830
then I'll plead with him. Please, big brother, please.

367
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,030
G-g-give me a chance, for my sake, okay?

368
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,740
Be gentler with Shiyi. Don't throw her down. Right?

369
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,900
And if this still doesn't work, then I'll give you guys red envelopes.

370
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,560
For everyone in your class.

371
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,630
- I'll reimburse your tuitions. <br> - Monkey.

372
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,030
You're serious about her.

373
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,560
- I'm just– no, I haven't. <br> - You've fallen in.

374
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,160
I just think, this situation,

375
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,910
we handled it wrong. I feel guilty.

376
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,570
It's different now. You like her.

377
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,210
Don't deny it. Would I not know you?

378
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,510
Sure. Like you said, maybe your feelings for my older cousin

379
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,030
are the simplest of feelings that males can have for females.

380
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,670
Exactly.

381
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,420
- Exactly? <br> - Yes.

382
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,220
Then, this handsome guy standing at the door,

383
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,970
- It'd be the same, the same. <br> - The same? If he was wronged,

384
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,460
then you would also go and suffer for him?

385
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,310
You'd hand out red envelopes for him?

386
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,410
Impressive. Cheers to you.

387
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,250
Welcome, my new classmate.

388
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,350
No more drinking. Pick a song, let's sing.

389
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:03,020
<i>(Hou Jue drank too much, he's upset.)</i>

390
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:38,150
<i>(Take good care of him.)</i>

391
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,140
Slow, slow, slow.

392
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,180
Slow. You've got him, got him right, Little Zhou?

393
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,750
- Got him? Be careful. <br> - I've got him.

394
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,930
Here, here, here. Goodness. Why did he drink so much?

395
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,880
- Come here. Slow, slow, be careful. <br>- Come on, come on.

396
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,760
What's up with you, drinking so much for no reason?

397
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,550
Help me lift him onto the pillows.

398
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,680
Okay. Take off his socks.

399
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,880
Look at you.

400
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,550
It's okay, you don't need to help him take it off. Just leave him like this. It's okay.

401
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,100
You don't need to worry, I'll handle it. Go and rest.

402
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,480
- Go ahead. <br> - Okay, Sister Zhang.

403
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,500
- What are you doing? This child. <br> - If you need anything, just call me.

404
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,710
Go ahead, no problem.

405
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,490
Go ahead and leave.

406
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,380
That's enough.

407
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,350
Hurry and sleep. Stop messing around now, okay? Stop messing around.

408
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,930
Stop messing around now, stop messing around.

409
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,040
Jr. President Hou.

410
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,090
President Hou isn't in.

411
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,930
Where did he go?

412
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,990
The rooftop.

413
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,610
Do your stuff then.

414
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,320
Wait for me here.

415
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
President Hou.

416
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,870
What is it, Dad?

417
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,520
I know all about Wu Shiyi.

418
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,530
According to the contract, if a bodyguard

419
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:38,000
can be replaced if there is any flaw occurs during the job. We can cancel the contract.

420
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,650
No need to cancel the contract.

421
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,050
Shiyi didn't do anything wrong.

422
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,380
How do you know she didn't do anything wrong.

423
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,120
Shiyi definitely wouldn't do anything like this.

424
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,180
We just need the police to explain about it.

425
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,690
Tell me who did wrong then?

426
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,060
Tell me who did wrong?

427
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,220
Actually you and I both know what exactly happened.

428
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,700
Wu Shiyi is an excellent bodyguard.

429
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,350
Now that she is under suspicion for theft and is transferred back to the company for investigation,

430
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:12,070
it will cause a big effect upon her future. Understand?

431
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,270
This is all thanks to your internet celebrity girlfriend, Fan Lu.

432
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,170
What girlfriend? She is not my girlfriend. We are just regular friends.

433
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,220
We have no relationship at all. I only helped her film a program last time.

434
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,490
That's not what you told me that day.

435
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:26,170
That day? You are being ridiculous.

436
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,130
Dad, I shouldn't have cheated you, that's my fault.

437
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,680
Since you also think Shiyi is not a problem,

438
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,310
let her come back then.

439
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm tell you, the way you look now is the most ridiculous. Understand?

440
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,090
A bodyguard is reported to the police for the crime of theft.

441
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,130
The security company's President Zhao has to safeguard his company's reputation

442
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,410
and transfers her back for investigation.

443
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,600
It's impossible for us to let her come back to protect your safety now.

444
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,080
It's such a simple rationale, and you don't understand?

445
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,310
No, Dad.

446
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,460
We can... but she... <br> - But what? What's this but, but?

447
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,210
There is no but.

448
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,180
Blame yourself for being careless in making friends.

449
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,690
Let's talk further once there is a result from this matter.

450
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,150
Move aside. I'm hitting the ball.

451
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,070
- Hit-Hit the ball. <br> - I'm hitting the ball.

452
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,270
Last time, they said that expense wasn't allowed...

453
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,430
Yes, put it there, right there.

454
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,190
Face that desk.

455
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,570
- We are leaving then. <br> - Okay, thanks.

456
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,470
This is...

457
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,240
Come here. You sit here.

458
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,280
<i> - He sits there. <br> - There?</i>

459
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,290
Leave this side to me. I'm sitting here, right?

460
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,040
Isn't everyone more energetic in working now?

461
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,830
I decided to stay here to be with you.

462
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,200
<i>Isn't this ridiculous?</i>

463
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,260
You all aren't accustomed to me sitting here, right?

464
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,480
<i>- No. <br> - No.</i>

465
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,480
I'll go back then.

466
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,530
Lili, move away the desk.

467
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,330
You can sit back there.

468
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,890
Let me tell you. You are temporarily sitting there.

469
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,780
Also, when you come to work, don't dress just like me.

470
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,460
Xiao Zhou, here's your badge.

471
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,260
- Remember to always wear it. <br> - Okay.

472
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,690
You have fun first. Don't wait for me.

473
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,490
How about I come to you after I've watched the movie?

474
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,650
Okay, pay here. Wait a moment please.

475
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,740
Xiao Zhang?

476
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,780
- LI Chu, you are here too? <br> - Why are you here? Such a coincidence.

477
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,670
I'm here to watch a movie.

478
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,120
Here, come.

479
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,510
I have vouchers. No need to spend money.

480
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,580
- This is embarrassing. <br> - It's nothing.

481
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,120
What movie do you want to watch?

482
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,810
I... I don't know which one to watch.

483
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,820
How about you? Which one do you want to watch?

484
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,660
It's about a man who wakes up from sleep and becomes a silly husky.

485
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,550
- Husky dog? <br> - Yes.

486
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,840
- The one that's always turned into an meme? <br> - Yes.

487
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,640
That should be fun. Let's watch it then.

488
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,950
Okay.

489
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,810
Here.

490
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,710
I get emotional and cry easily.

491
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,730
Don't laugh at me. I probably can't change this problem in my whole life.

492
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,790
How is it a problem?

493
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,660
It only proves that you value friendship and feelings.

494
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,750
Thanks for understanding. I really wouldn't want you to laugh at me.

495
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,780
Why would I? That's old-fashioned values.

496
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,170
Isn't there a saying, when a man cries, it's not a crime?

497
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,080
Right, that's how the song was.

498
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,510
Yes, yes, yes.

499
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,160
Come, come, welcome, welcome.

500
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,630
Welcome, welcome.

501
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,170
Hold this for a bit. I'm going to the restroom.

502
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,600
Okay, go ahead.

503
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,030
<i>Come, come, welcome, welcome.</i>

504
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,420
<i>Welcome, welcome.</i>

505
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,010
<i>Welcome, welcome.</i>

506
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,460
Yingnan.

507
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,990
What are you doing?

508
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,650
Didn't you say not to bother Shiyi?

509
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,300
You still don't need to make yourself this way.

510
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,970
Ice cream? Is it...

511
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,400
Just bought it. You can have it.

512
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,860
- It's already melted. <br> - The weather is too hot.

513
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,720
Didn't you stay away from sweets? It's fattening.

514
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,560
I didn't eat it before because I was in a bad mood.

515
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,380
Now that I'm in a good mood, I eat whatever I want.

516
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,970
Wipe your sweat.

517
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,740
I am...

518
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,230
Here, you wipe.

519
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,770
Yingnan, are you here on a date?

520
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,130
Where? Which company? How old?

521
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,830
What are you thinking? Always thinking nonsense all day.

522
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,660
<i>I'm leaving first. See you another time.</i>

523
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,820
You... See? Aren't you secretly on a date?

524
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,990
What are you talking about? What secretly?

525
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,140
Let me tell you, Wu Tianyi. Even if I were on a date,

526
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,350
it has nothing to do with you.

527
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,940
It's not your concern.

528
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,780
Yingnan!

529
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,540
So sorry.

530
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,490
The class is full. How about the next class?

531
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,690
- When is the next class? <br> - After half a year.

532
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,200
Half a year? That takes too long.

533
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,140
We have only one course every half a year.

534
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,310
Please make allowance.

535
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,750
Just add him in. He definitely won't make trouble.

536
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,620
We really can't allow that.

537
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,540
We have to, first of all, guarantee the quality of training.

538
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,800
Secondly, we have to protect the instructure's energy and stamina.

539
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,930
We normally have small classes.

540
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:25,480
In the small class, it's hands-on training.

541
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,810
This is so that the students will learn the real thing.

542
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,240
None of that matters.

543
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,900
How about this, I'll pay you double to add me.

544
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,870
Double isn't enough? Five times then. Hurry and add me.

545
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,700
Do you think this is an auction house. Just bid high to win?

546
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,670
It won't work no matter how many times more.

547
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:48,430
How about this? Leave your name and contact info.

548
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,060
If anyone withdraws during the class,

549
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,740
you can take the spot.

550
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,160
That works. You withdraw then. I'll replace you.

551
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:04,610
Why? I... I'm not withdrawing.

552
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,720
- I'll give you double the tuition. <br> - I'm not withdrawing even with ten times.

553
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,530
Are you withdrawing or not?

554
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,810
Okay, okay.

555
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,280
The two of you, please go outside to discuss.

556
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,620
I still have work to do.

557
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,590
Hai Xing, I've noticed that you bacck down whenever I need your help. Why don't you have any sense of dedication?

558
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,040
Who backs down? Their quota is full, so I can't help it. Just wait for the next class.

559
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,930
How can I wait half a year?

560
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,950
Hurry and think of a way.

561
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,190
Actually, I don't think this company is worth too much. Why don't you buy it?

562
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,370
I buy it? It's faster to break your legs.

563
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,160
Be careful.
