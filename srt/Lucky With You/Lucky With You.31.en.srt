00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,159
(Episode 31)

4
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,680
I guess he took the proposal...

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,359
and sold it to Hedgehog Factory.

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Zhang Sheng.

7
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,560
No wonder I haven't been able to find him.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,359
He scammed me for my proposal.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,239
Do you still have...

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,120
the proposal on your computer?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
- Yes. - That's good.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,040
The save time is on the file.

13
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,359
If they violate your rights,

14
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,480
that can be your proof.

15
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,799
Okay.

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Thank you.

17
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,479
You're welcome.

18
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,560
I came for this matter.

19
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,439
So I'll get going now.

20
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,919
Shi Yi.

21
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,919
Be careful.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,199
You're telling me to be careful?

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,919
I'm pretty good at fighting.

24
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,120
Call me if you need anything.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm leaving.

26
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,919
Why are you here?

27
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,520
You can't leave the hotel if I don't leave the hotel.

28
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,919
Is this rule too strict for you?

29
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,599
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,159
- I... - I don't want to hear it.

31
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,039
I hope you won't do it again.

32
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,039
Sir, we've reached the internet cafe.

33
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Hou, good news!

34
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,839
The money was transferred out.

35
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,279
Now it's transferred back.

36
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,240
Was it a problem with the system or did someone do it?

37
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,920
It must have been done by someone.

38
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,800
But I don't know why it's being transferred...

39
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,879
back and forth.

40
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,040
What does this mean?

41
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,839
Whatever.

42
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,600
Transfer the money...

43
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,040
to another secured account of our company.

44
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
Keep it confidential.

45
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
Okay.

46
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,120
Should we call the police?

47
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,959
Public Security...

48
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,040
monitors account anomalies at all times, right?

49
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,720
Yes. Our account is now...

50
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,079
under the surveillance of Public Security.

51
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,680
Make it quick then.

52
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,399
How can we call the police when the money is out,

53
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,839
but not when it's in?

54
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,480
What will that make me?

55
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
All right.

56
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Mr. Hou.

57
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,160
Hey, Ma Yong.

58
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,720
Let me tell you something.

59
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,920
The 20 million we lost...

60
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,319
has been transferred back.

61
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
What do you think is going on?

62
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,199
That's great.

63
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,439
Congratulations.

64
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,480
That person's conscience must have kicked in.

65
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,800
- It's hot. - Keep them for me.

66
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
Here. Take a loin.

67
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
- I'm getting the ones I want. - Are you hot?

68
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,279
- Nice. - It's so hot.

69
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,199
- I want that. - What do you want? Chili?

70
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,920
- No, not chili. - No, this is for you.

71
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,160
- Can I have the green pepper? - Here's your green pepper.

72
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,120
- We have everything. - Can we eat this?

73
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,480
- Go over there. - It's for you.

74
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,959
- Here you go. - Shi Yi.

75
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,800
Come on over!

76
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
The pack of hungry wolves will finish the food.

77
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,759
Come on. Hurry.

78
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,559
- I can't eat this much. - Eat up.

79
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,120
Mr. Lan, you look so handsome when you grill meat.

80
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
You look much better in person than on TV.

81
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Is that so?

82
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,879
When Mr. Lan and I were in the States,

83
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,450
we always had gatherings with our friends.

84
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,519
His cooking skills are amazing.

85
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,000
Every time girls eat the meat he grills,

86
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,919
they will fall in love with him.

87
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,480
His nickname...

88
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,330
was the Prince of Barbecue.

89
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,799
Yes.

90
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,399
But after that, don't they fall in love with you?

91
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,559
His specialty is making desserts.

92
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,330
He was taught by a Michelin three-star chef.

93
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,330
He's jealous of me now because he can't perform.

94
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,399
I'm jealous of you?

95
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,330
You were the one who always complained...

96
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,360
why can't those girls start with my dessert...

97
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,879
and eat your grilled meat afterward.

98
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,720
Then you would be the one they fall in love with.

99
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,090
Lan Qi, no way.

100
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,240
Yes, otherwise, why don't I even have a girlfriend...

101
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,399
when you've already divorced three times?

102
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,399
You'll lose friends if you talk like that.

103
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,759
Let's go eat our barbecue.

104
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,120
Come.

105
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,210
Come on.

106
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
You're not hungry?

107
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,919
No.

108
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,960
Stop grilling and eat.

109
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Let's have a drink.

110
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,330
- Here. - Thank you.

111
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,120
Do you want some alcohol?

112
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,639
No.

113
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,799
I don't drink on the job.

114
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,720
Fine. I won't drink if you won't.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,720
I'll stay on the same channel as you.

116
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,450
Drink.

117
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,759
Everyone's enjoying themselves. You should relax.

118
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,799
No. If you won't drink,

119
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,879
how can we talk when we're not on the same channel?

120
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,159
I won't drink.

121
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,559
Give me some time. You will.

122
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,960
Here.

123
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,480
From what I've heard,

124
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,720
you're a great cook.

125
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,330
It's all right.

126
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,480
I can handle a small gathering of 10 people.

127
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,090
Then telling my dad you can't cook the other day was an act?

128
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,720
It wasn't an act.

129
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,039
Old people are like children. You have to coax them.

130
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,720
You really haven't changed at all.

131
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,600
Remember you had a nickname when you were a kid?

132
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,399
I remember. Chameleon.

133
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,120
But I don't hate it.

134
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,159
I didn't have a good dad...

135
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,879
or a proper background.

136
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,159
I camouflage myself...

137
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,240
to achieve my goals.

138
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm not embarrassed about it.

139
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,200
Is that your law for success?

140
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,679
One of them.

141
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,879
Come on, don't be so serious.

142
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,039
Look at you now.

143
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,039
You've changed a lot.

144
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,360
You used to laugh so hard at bad jokes.

145
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,759
Why do you have so much on your mind now?

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,399
That was before.

147
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,399
I do miss those times.

148
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,519
But there's no turning back.

149
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,759
Yes, we can.

150
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,720
As long as you trust me.

151
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,000
Hello. Can I talk to the person in charge?

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,480
Hello, do you have an appointment?

153
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,679
Yes, I'm Hou Jue.

154
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,440
Xiao Yue, he's here for me.

155
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,639
Hou Jue, right?

156
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,080
Mr. Xiao?

157
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,279
Zi Heng.

158
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,720
- Hello. - We don't do that here.

159
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
- Just call me Zi Heng. - You...

160
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,720
Take a seat.

161
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
Welcome to Hedgehog Factory.

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
You designed this?

163
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,840
It looks like everything but a company.

164
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,600
What you think is what you see.

165
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,720
What would you like to drink?

166
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,080
- Water is fine. - All right.

167
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,480
You said on the phone...

168
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,919
that you were the one who designed the book bar.

169
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,919
Yes.

170
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,320
I designed it when I was in college.

171
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
Have you given it to anyone?

172
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,279
Zhang Sheng.

173
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,360
When I presented my project,

174
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,960
on the day itself,

175
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,519
he said he especially liked the project.

176
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
We were about to sign the contract.

177
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,000
But something urgent came up and I had to leave.

178
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,240
He told me to send the project to his email.

179
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,519
Did you make any changes afterward?

180
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,200
If you did, what did you change?

181
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,320
I actually made some very basic improvements.

182
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,320
I increased the overall sense of chaos...

183
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,919
to make the whole space more compact.

184
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,120
It's not that functional either.

185
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
It's similar to this office.

186
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
The sense of disorder is very strong.

187
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,200
And it's easy for people to communicate...

188
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,559
as the area partition isn't so clear.

189
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,639
Thank you for acknowledging my design.

190
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,159
Let me tell you, this kind of office...

191
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,759
is where geniuses are born.

192
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,159
That's an overstatement.

193
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,679
I just didn't want to design it...

194
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,240
too much like a company.

195
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,519
This is a place for young people.

196
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,519
Young people need energy and passion.

197
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,919
You have to open your mind for that.

198
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,399
When I designed the book bar, I only had one idea.

199
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,320
I wanted the book bar to not look like a book bar.

200
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,279
That was what I loved the most.

201
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,840
The most important part of your design.

202
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
But you know what?

203
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,000
That was exactly what Zhang Sheng said to me.

204
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,639
When I presented the project,

205
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,759
I told them about the whole concept.

206
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
How can you prove...

207
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,519
that you've given this proposal to Zhang Sheng?

208
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I sent him an email.

209
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,360
Here's the email record.

210
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,399
My friend introduced me to Zhang Sheng.

211
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,879
Then I went to his company.

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,159
He loved the design.

213
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,799
He wanted to sign a contract with me that day.

214
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,039
But something urgent came up, so we couldn't make it.

215
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
Look.

216
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,360
I emailed the design to him.

217
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,639
When I went to look for him afterward,

218
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,440
he had resigned with his entire team.

219
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,159
And the company had no idea about my proposal.

220
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,480
Let me tell you. Zhang Sheng interviewed with me.

221
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,519
He brought this design with him.

222
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,679
He said he designed it himself.

223
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,440
While we were discussing it,

224
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
the concept didn't match up.

225
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
So we didn't collaborate in the end.

226
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,279
But I bought the design.

227
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll be direct, Hou Jue.

228
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,720
You've met Zhang Sheng.

229
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,279
Comparatively,

230
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,000
I trust you more.

231
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,720
I also trust my instincts.

232
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
The next time you come here, organize the details and process...

233
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,679
on your computer and sign the papers.

234
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,720
I'll have my company's legal team look into it.

235
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,799
No problem.

236
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:08,960
- Okay. - No problem.

237
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,720
I want to eat the cheese pudding from this place.

238
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,240
I heard there's a two-hour line.

239
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,279
No way.

240
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,559
At this age, you still eat desserts.

241
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,720
"Dongmen Pedestrian Street."

242
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm free anyway.

243
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,759
Dongmen Pedestrian Street.

244
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,399
- How much longer? - Don't worry.

245
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,559
Wait a little longer.

246
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm waiting to go shopping.

247
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,279
It's fine.

248
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,039
It's so long.

249
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,399
- Young man. - It's not moving.

250
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,559
Is this line for the cheese pudding?

251
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,600
Yes.

252
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,759
So many people.

253
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,919
Just like when we bought hairtail back then.

254
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,039
Sir, it's considered quiet today.

255
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,600
What's taking so long?

256
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,879
I should've brought a folding stool.

257
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,480
My blood sugar level is high.

258
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,839
I'll just have a little.

259
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,119
Here, eat more.

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,410
I'll help myself then.

261
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,319
You need to relax...

262
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,200
to feel the happiness of desserts.

263
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,440
Isn't it delicious?

264
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,359
You're right.

265
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,650
All these years,

266
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,170
all I've done is work.

267
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,240
I feel like I've missed out on a lot of good things.

268
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,920
Actually, the good things are always here.

269
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:42,079
As long as you slow down and see properly,

270
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,279
you'll know it has always been around us.

271
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,170
Since you like it,

272
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,720
let's eat as much as we want today.

273
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,279
I'll go buy some more.

274
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,319
It's okay.

275
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,000
Mr. Wu?

276
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,279
Why are you here?

277
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,359
You two look kind of guilty.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,680
Why would I feel guilty?

279
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,200
Mr. Wu, well...

280
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,920
Why don't you join us?

281
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,680
Forget it.

282
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm just an extra.

283
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,119
I won't bother you.

284
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,759
I'm done eating, Mr. Wu.

285
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,599
Why don't you sit down?

286
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,960
You're still here.

287
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,410
How can I take your place?

288
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm not doing that.

289
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm done. Let's go.

290
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,119
Mr. Wu, Xiao Zhang.

291
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,000
I have to go now.

292
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,279
Here you go.

293
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,359
Thank you.

294
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,559
See you later.

295
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,079
See you.

296
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,599
He's busy but he's not working.

297
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,279
Instead, he invited you to coffee.

298
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,079
He's good.

299
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
You're so strange.

300
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,519
Look at this place.

301
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,720
It's where young people go on dates.

302
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,759
He invited you here.

303
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,170
His motive isn't that simple.

304
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,200
So you have a clear motive? Why are you here?

305
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,039
I saw that you wanted it but you didn't want to wait in line.

306
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,480
So I came to buy it for you.

307
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,839
So I should thank you, is that it?

308
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:20,839
- But I... - Mr. Li...

309
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,920
saw that I wanted it and brought me here.

310
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,000
Can't he?

311
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
You're a man.

312
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,000
If you want to do something, just do it.

313
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,960
Stop hesitating.

314
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,960
He's a hypocrite.

315
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,650
He does something but means something else.

316
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,170
No wonder he kept asking about us.

317
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,799
I have nothing to do with you right now.

318
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,519
Wu Tian Yi, remember this.

319
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm a free man.

320
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,319
However free you are, you can't be free with him.

321
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,200
You're always so dressed up.

322
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,799
Zhang Ying Nan, I realize...

323
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,680
that you've become a little vain.

324
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm vain.

325
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,480
Did you just realize that?

326
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,240
What about you?

327
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,319
Just stay here and be jealous and envious.

328
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,359
Bye.

329
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,839
Goodbye.

330
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:15,410
Vain. So vain.

331
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,839
(Xing and Eight Guests)

332
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,359
Excuse me.

333
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,319
Coming.

334
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,839
Hello, sir. Here's the menu.

335
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,650
I don't need the menu.

336
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,599
One Hai Xing Fried Rice, please.

337
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,359
I heard your Hai Xing Fried Rice is really good.

338
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,559
So you're a regular? You should've told me earlier.

339
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,039
Which company do you work for?

340
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,759
I'm from Zhirong Construction's Security Department.

341
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,359
You're from Zhirong Construction.

342
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
I don't mean to brag,

343
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,680
but my boss and Mr. Hou Junior...

344
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,410
are absolute best friends!

345
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
I heard.

346
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,519
You heard?

347
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,410
Seems like my boss is quite famous.

348
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,519
To be honest, lately,

349
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,559
Mr. Hou Junior seems very exhausted.

350
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,319
Just because of some design plan,

351
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,000
he keeps going...

352
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,359
to some hedgehog company.

353
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,000
Boss.

354
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,039
He's from Zhirong Construction's Security Department.

355
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,480
He said he knows you.

356
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,359
Hello, Mr. Hai.

357
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,799
Hello.

358
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,319
Treat him well.

359
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,359
What's going on?

360
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,519
I'll go place your order.

361
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,839
Okay.

362
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,650
Mr. Hou, are you feeling better now?

363
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,960
Yes.

364
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,680
That's good.

365
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,200
Mr. Huang from Security wants to see you.

366
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,279
Would you like to see him?

367
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,759
- Tell him to come up. - Okay.

368
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,119
Isn't this the security footage the day the proposal went missing?

369
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,400
I've already seen it.

370
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,640
What's wrong?

371
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,960
We seem to have overlooked someone.

372
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,160
Overlooked someone?

373
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,799
Who is it?

374
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,920
Hai Xing?

375
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,039
Yes.

376
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,160
I went to eat at his restaurant earlier.

377
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,880
As soon as he heard...

378
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,079
I was from Zhirong Construction's Security Department,

379
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,720
his expression immediately changed.

380
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,599
He greeted me...

381
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,200
and went upstairs right away.

382
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,559
But he just came downstairs.

383
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,799
He didn't even do anything.

384
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,480
That got my attention on him.

385
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,839
As he is Mr. Hou Junior's friend,

386
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,960
we completely overlooked him.

387
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,839
You're right.

388
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,559
Because he's his best friend,

389
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,160
we completely overlooked him.

390
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,359
Did you say anything...

391
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,559
at his restaurant?

392
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,640
No.

393
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,759
Bring him here.

394
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,240
Okay.

395
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,559
God of luck, protect me.

396
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,640
That was a close call.

397
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,440
I'll really do more good deeds.

398
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,119
Bless me.

399
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
Boss.

400
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,880
What are you doing? Yoga?

401
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,480
Nothing. Why?

402
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,079
Well, someone's looking for you downstairs.

403
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,640
From the Security Department?

404
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,839
No.

405
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,960
It's that woman who knows martial arts.

406
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Did that guy from the Security Department...

407
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
tell you anything?

408
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,839
Nothing much.

409
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,519
He said our fried rice was delicious.

410
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,519
Nothing else?

411
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,319
Nothing else.

412
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
What's wrong?

413
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,319
Boss, why did you look so perplexed by him?

414
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,200
You can tell?

415
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,440
A little bit.

416
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,000
You seemed like you owed him money.

417
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,599
You...

418
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,400
You didn't even send me a message.

419
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,640
The chili is finished.

420
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,160
I've given it to everyone.

421
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,359
It's delicious.

422
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,839
I came to bring you the bottle.

423
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,759
You specially came for just a small matter?

424
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,400
You should've told me and I could've gone to get it.

425
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
Why go through so much trouble?

426
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,200
How is it? Is it good?

427
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,680
It's spicy.

428
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,440
It's okay.

429
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,599
- Well... - Well...

430
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,720
How is Hou Jue?

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,000
Monkey?

432
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,240
He's doing good.

433
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,839
In my opinion, never better.

434
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,880
Think about it.

435
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,359
When my cousin makes her move, anything can be fixed.

436
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,680
In my opinion, he's doing better than before.

437
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,680
That's good.

438
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,279
Do you want to try our new dish?

439
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,799
Hai Xing Fried Rice 3.0.

440
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,079
I've added a lot of creativity.

441
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,400
You'll be surprised. I'll get it for you.

442
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,559
No need.

443
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,839
I'm busy, you go ahead.

444
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,240
- I'm leaving. - It's okay. It'll be quick.

445
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,400
- No, it's okay. I'm leaving. - It'll be quick.

446
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
Then I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

447
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,200
No, don't bother, really.

448
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,599
You don't have to see me off. Bye.

449
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,599
Okay, bye.

450
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:51,119
That's a promise. Drive slowly.

451
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,119
Hai Xing.

452
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,160
You're Hai Xing, right?

453
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,680
Yes. Table for two?

454
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,119
We're from Zhirong Construction.

455
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,279
Mr. Hou would like to see you.

456
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,839
Mr. Hou?

457
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,839
He could have called.

458
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,119
Why be so formal?

459
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,240
Okay, please wait just a moment.

460
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,359
- Dolly. - I'm here, Boss.

461
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,359
Take good care of the store.

462
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,519
I'm going out.

463
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,920
- Let's go. - Come on.

464
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,880
Come on.

465
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,039
Get in the trunk!

466
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,680
Stop!

467
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
Hold it in.

468
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,039
Why are you yelling?

469
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,119
I told you to hold it in.

470
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
It hurts.

471
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,640
It's just a scratch.

472
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
Back then, at the training class,

473
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,319
I tortured you so much,

474
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,599
but I didn't see you scream.

475
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,319
Well,

476
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,839
I'm scared of nothing but pain.

477
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Scared of pain?

478
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,039
Then don't cause any trouble.

479
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,839
I didn't cause any trouble.

480
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,400
Didn't you see me...

481
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,279
run away when I saw them?

482
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,359
Tell me. What's going on?

483
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,359
Got yourself into debt?

484
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,039
Charged with a protection fee by a thug or something?

485
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,079
No.

486
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,039
Well, yes.

487
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,359
It's a thug, an old-timer.

488
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,920
The kind that steals girls.

489
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
He's shameless.

490
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,119
Then you should've called the police.

491
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,799
It's just a small matter.

492
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,599
Let's not bother the police.

493
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,880
Just think of it as me getting rid of the bad guys.

494
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,119
Listen up.

495
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,599
Don't do anything illegal.

496
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Compared to what that old thug did,

497
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,279
I'm considered a hero.

498
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,119
Please do one more.

499
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,160
Hero?

500
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Thank you.

501
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,920
Hero.

502
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,519
If you can't solve it, call the police.

503
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,079
Or else, call me.

504
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,519
I've been alive all these years. I'm not afraid of that.

505
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,759
Forget it. Just go to work. Leave me.

506
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,440
What if they come back?

507
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,400
I can run, but I can't hide forever.

508
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
I'll talk to them nicely.

509
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,759
Okay, I'm leaving.

510
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,279
Bye.

(Yuegang Colorful Stars Art Publishing House)

512
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,680
I'll go first.

513
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
- Hey! - Sorry.

514
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,440
- What are you doing? - Let me go first.

515
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,519
Follow that car!

516
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,720
What's with you?

517
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,759
Take a look at that paper later.

518
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
Okay.

519
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,400
Hello.

520
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,720
- I'm Li He Lin. - Hello.

521
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

522
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,279
What's with the pictures of the buildings?

523
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,720
Boring.

524
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,680
Mr. Wu.

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,319
It has been a while, Mr. Li.

526
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
It has been a while? We just met yesterday.

527
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,519
That's right.

528
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,000
My memory is so bad.

529
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,839
- See you later. - Wait.

530
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,720
I saw everything.

531
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,839
What did you see?

532
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,039
Did you think...

533
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,519
I wouldn't be able to recognize you...

534
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,960
if you dress up like this?

535
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,799
Wouldn't that make us colleagues for nothing?

536
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,400
What I'm wearing is none of your business.

537
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,680
That's true.

538
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,519
But you took my pictures without permission.

539
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,039
That's my business.

540
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,839
Mr. Wu, I know very well...

541
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,039
what you're thinking about.

542
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,920
If you really want to be with Xiao Zhang again,

543
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,440
why don't you just tell her?

544
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,440
You don't have to play tricks like these.

545
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,440
As an old colleague,

546
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,039
if you really don't like it,

547
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,839
I won't see her again.

548
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,960
But there's something I must make myself clear to you.

549
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,160
Xiao Zhang and I...

550
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,200
are purely just friends.

551
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,519
Together,

552
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,480
we just eat, talk, and watch movies.

553
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,359
That's all. There's nothing between us.

554
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,559
I'm single.

555
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,200
This is my way of life.

556
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,759
You don't have to follow me and take pictures of me.

557
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,559
As a person, you should be honest.

558
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Am I right?

559
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Li He Lin!

560
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,559
Listen up.

561
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,599
Stay away from Zhang Ying Nan.

562
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,119
I don't want to see you hitting on her again!

563
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,119
She'd rather let me hit on her...

564
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,279
than get back together with you!

565
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,160
Look at yourself!

566
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Li He Lin!

567
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,960
I didn't hit you, Mr. Wu.

568
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,960
My daughter bought this phone.

569
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,960
You made it like this.

570
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll have my daughter deal with you!

571
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Mr. Hou.

572
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,880
What happened to your hand?

573
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,769
It's just a scratch.

574
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,440
Your Hai Xing Fried Rice is really delicious.

575
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,679
I haven't had something this good in a while.

576
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,119
It's choking me.

577
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,360
Have a seat.

578
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,119
No, please eat. I'm not sitting.

579
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,159
Young people...

580
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,960
are so reckless.

581
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:54,880
It's just a scratch now.

582
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,119
But if you broke your bones,

583
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,360
it will be difficult to recover.

584
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,039
It's so good.

585
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,719
Let's go somewhere and have some tea.

586
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,079
Come upstairs.

587
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,360
Hello, Qian Qian?

588
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,840
Someone is picking a fight with Hai Xing again.

589
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,159
That guy looks nasty.

590
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,329
Please come back and save him.

591
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,719
Have a seat, sir.

592
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,679
I'll make you some tea.

593
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,639
Why did you steal my proposal?

594
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
I didn't.

595
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Did I hit the wrong person?

596
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,559
No.

597
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
No.

598
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,920
I've been thinking.

599
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,809
Why would you steal this proposal?

600
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,809
It has no use to you at all.

601
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,039
There's only one reason.

602
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,679
Someone must have ordered you to do it.

603
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,880
I've been working in this industry for so many years.

604
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,480
I've seen all sorts of people before.

605
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:37,880
To me, a proposal or a project...

606
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:40,039
is nothing.

607
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:43,920
I'm here today because I just want you to tell me...

608
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,400
who told you to do this.

609
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,809
Where's Hai Xing?

610
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:10,559
- He went up with a man. - Come again.

611
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,329
- Thank you. - Okay.

612
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,329
Then let me ask you another question.

613
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,719
How much did you get?

614
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,360
500,000 yuan.

615
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,809
500,000 yuan?

616
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,000
Hai Xing.

617
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,960
You're my son's best friend.

618
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,519
Am I right?

619
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,639
If you're going through a tough time,

620
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,000
tell me.

621
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Forget 500,000 yuan.

622
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,960
I'll help you find a way even if it's a million.

623
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,289
But how could you...

624
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,159
do this to your best friend's dad...

625
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,920
for a mere 500,000 yuan?

626
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,519
If Hou Jue finds out,

627
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,159
what will he think of you?

628
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,239
I've always thought you were an honest kid.

629
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,960
Why would you do such a disloyal thing...

630
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,719
for that little money?

631
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Hai Xing.

632
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,769
Don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

633
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:20,079
Let me ask you one last time.

634
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,719
Who told you to do this?

635
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,079
If you tell me now,

636
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,880
I'll pretend nothing happened.

637
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,159
If you don't,

638
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,119
the police will question you.

639
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,639
I'm sure you know...

640
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,039
what will happen then.

641
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,519
By then,

642
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:39,199
you'll also lose...

643
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,289
a friend like Hou Jue.

644
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,559
I...

645
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,840
always thought...

646
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,480
my best friend's dad...

647
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,599
was an outstanding...

648
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,880
and responsible man.

649
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
He was even my role model for some time.

650
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,769
But one day, I realized...

651
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,360
that he was horrible.

652
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,519
Because he deeply hurt a woman...

653
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,360
who loved him very much.

654
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,840
Say, if Monkey finds out,

655
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,360
what will he think?

656
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,329
What do you mean?

657
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,599
Guilty, are you?

658
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,769
Weren't you tough just now?

659
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,039
I don't even care about the mere 500,000 you mentioned.

660
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,440
I just want to get back at you.

661
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,400
Do you want to know who's behind this?

662
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,199
There's no way I'm telling you.

663
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,809
I stole the file.

664
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,159
I admit it.

665
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,519
I don't care if the police arrest me.

666
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,809
I've committed a crime.

667
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,039
But you're even worse...

668
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,960
because you stole a heart.

669
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,960
After stealing it,

670
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,119
you didn't even cherish it.

671
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,599
You smashed it to the ground and broke it.

672
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,239
Why isn't anyone arresting you?

673
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,159
You...

674
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,289
You're talking about Qian Qian?

675
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,519
Who else?

676
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,000
Who is she to you?

677
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,329
I thought she didn't have a boyfriend.

678
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,599
There's nothing between us.

679
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:29,400
It's a one-sided love.

680
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,769
I'm pursuing her.

681
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,119
But you stole her away.

682
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,329
I'm okay...

683
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,519
with you stealing her away.

684
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,679
Because you can give her a lot of things that I can't.

685
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,920
You can make her happy.

686
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,000
But you didn't make her happy and only made her feel worse.

687
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,360
She's such a good girl! You old womanizer!

688
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,639
Why are you such a jerk?

689
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,840
Aren't you ashamed?
