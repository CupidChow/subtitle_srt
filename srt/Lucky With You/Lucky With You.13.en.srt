<i> (Episode 13)</i>

19
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,080
Hai Xing, I've noticed every time I asked you for help and then you ran away.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,960
- Do you have any devotion spirit? <br> - Who runs away?

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,900
I can't do anything, they said the class is full. Wait for the next one.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
How can I wait for six months?

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,640
Quickly tell me what should I do?

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,980
I've looked around and perhaps it won't cost that money to acquire it. You can buy the company.

25
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,960
Buy the company? I think it's quicker for me to break your leg.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
Seriously. I can beat you up now.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,570
I've learnt few moves from Qian Qian.

28
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,430
When don't you ask Qian Qian? She is the instructor.

29
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,120
You go ask her and add me to the list.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,530
- I won't do it. Who wants to say it should do it.<br> - If you don't say it, who is going to do it?

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,220
I can't say it.

32
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,320
Yes, we have some emotional foundation between us,

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,810
it's just one word. But I can't let her make mistakes, can I?

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,580
If I send you there is too easy,

35
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,490
but what if she got fired because of this?

36
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,860
Then I will have to marry her. I'm not ready yet.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,450
- You are too responsible.<br> - That's right.

38
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,900
Then what is it going to happen after marriage?

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,190
She will be at home and I work. She will take care the kids at home.

40
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,560
How many kids are you planning to have?

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,960
Two within two years.

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,670
Do you know what am I afraid of? I'm afraid based on Qian Qian's personality, she might bully you after you got married.

43
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,480
That tough personality.

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,960
Do you know why am I here? I'm here to learn few moves in order to conquer and restrain her.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,870
If she screamed at me, I will...

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,010
cook, use my cooking to conquer her stomach.

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,580
Who is getting fired by the company?

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,490
Then, who are you marrying?

49
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,360
Someone.

50
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,450
- Why are you here?<br>- I want to attend your Sanda class.

51
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,810
But the class is full, can you add me to the list?

52
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,350
- Why?<br> - I want to learn martial art to protect myself.

53
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,120
Change another answer.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,350
Hai Xing has been bullied.

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,330
- I thought I could be here to help him.<br> - Change another answer.

56
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,020
I am bored at home, I'm here to stretch my body.

57
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,910
This reason is very reasonable.

58
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,890
Let's go for placement test.

59
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,300
What placement test ? Can I join after the test ?

60
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,870
How to test?<br> Let's go for the test.

61
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,630
Is it here?

62
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,360
It's too shocked, too surprised.

63
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,320
You can't sustain even 26 rounds?

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,620
It's 27 rounds, coach.

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm already at the class, why do I need to run with him?

66
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,130
- You are the one who wants to have babies with her. You don't know why you are running with me?<br> - You dumb.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,560
Hai Xing, carry on running. It's good for your body.

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,920
I don't want babies. Can I take a break?

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,010
Then do you want to join the training class?

70
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,830
Report to Coach. Mission accomplished.

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,150
- Are you tired? <br> - No.

72
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,400
Can you carry on?

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,590
That's not bad. Run another 20 rounds.

74
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,690
Coach. Can we have quick recovery?

75
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,760
Can we experience something else?

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,130
This is too boring.

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,860
You want to change another format to make you guys happy?

78
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,910
Follow me.

79
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,880
It can't be good.

80
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,470
<i> (Eagle Security)</i>

81
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,130
Keep up the position.

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,050
Coach, I have a question.

83
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,130
Go ahead.

84
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,230
We are here to learn Sanda.

85
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,620
I understand you want us to run, it's to train our strength. But why do we need to do splits?

86
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,360
We are not learning dancing.

87
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,130
If I can't beat someone then I will show him my splits.

88
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,910
Perhaps that's the killer move.

89
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,280
Tendon stretch is the basic for every moves.

90
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,060
If the ligament is too stiff,

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,970
your body parts will not be coordinated.

92
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,880
You got get injured easily.

93
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,310
Coach, I'm injured.

94
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,520
For real?

95
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,630
Coach, please help me out.

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,370
Coach, please help.

97
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Hello Manger Gao, we have a student here who can't stand anymore.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,820
We might have a vacancy at the Sanda class.

99
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,470
I will carry on training.

100
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,390
- Are you sure? <br> - I can do it.

101
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,550
Manager Gao, the student said he could carry on.

102
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,320
Bye.

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,410
You can carry on, can't you?

104
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,380
20 squat jumps.

105
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,000
Coach, I'm am an advance student.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,090
If you want to haze the new member, you don't need to torture me.

107
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,050
50 squat jumps.

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,820
- I'm here as a companion.<br> - 60.

109
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,600
I will do 50.

110
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,140
One!

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,560
Two!

112
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,140
Are you laughing?

113
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,620
50 squat jumps, both of you.

114
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,950
- Together.<br>- Put your hands on your head.

115
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,620
- Quick.<br>- Quick.

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,510
Squat jump.

117
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,380
I can squat jump, look.

118
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,450
One!

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,430
You did the move pretty well.

120
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,190
Next, we will practice body slam.

121
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,170
Let me explain the key point on bodyslam.

122
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,610
Shiyi, ready.

123
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,920
When your opponent attack you.

124
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,040
Block and step forward,

125
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,140
grab under her armpits and slam.

126
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,790
I just dissected the move, next I will do it in one move.

127
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,870
Can you see that?

128
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,150
Good. You go first.

129
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,040
Ready.

130
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,510
Next.

131
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,770
You, you can go first.

132
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,680
I'm sick.

133
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,540
Next.

134
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,590
Next.

135
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,710
Don't laugh.

136
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,180
Get up!

137
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,390
Get up!

138
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,770
Her punch is too quick.

139
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,440
Again.

140
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,570
Wu Shiyi, stand up.

141
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,090
Don't laugh. This is a training ground, take it seriously.

142
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,210
This classmate, even if we get slammed hundred times,

143
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,320
if the movement is not up to standard, we have to carry on.

144
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,290
That's right. Come on.

145
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,580
Slam.

146
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,040
You are too heavy. I can't life you.

147
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,460
All right,

148
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,860
you don't lift me like this. Let me down.

149
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,580
Like this, okay?

150
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,030
You have to slam this way, okay?

151
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,700
That's it! My back!

152
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,300
My stomach.

153
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,560
I can't, I need to go to the hospital.

154
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,780
I can't do the class anymore, I can't.

155
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,240
Let's go to the hospital.

156
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,070
Ridiculous. You're all teammates, can't they be more gentle?

157
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,010
How can they do that? Training is serious.

158
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,900
If your mom saw, she would be heartbroken.

159
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,930
In the past, in the training team, I've had much worse injuries.

160
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,020
Are all injuries the same? Some injuries make people angry.

161
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,050
Some help people relieve the hate in their hearts.

162
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,200
Some will make our hearts ache.

163
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,520
- Alright. Well if you feel uncomfortable anywhere, let me know. <br> - Okay.

164
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,870
Thank you, Doctor Gao.

165
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,920
Thankfully, she's fine.

166
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,690
Can't you guys be gentler? Look what's happened to her.

167
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,830
Yes, ma'am!

168
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,780
Are you okay?

169
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,050
I'm fine.

170
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,400
Did Hou Jue and them leave?

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,360
They finally left. This young master

172
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,070
was so angry. He kept nagging at me to stop letting you do the training. I'm really impressed by his persistence.

173
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,130
Just ignore him.

174
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,120
He's just being childish.

175
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,130
Quite.

176
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,560
But he's also pretty cute.

177
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,090
Sorry, sorry. I'll help you massage it.

178
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,000
Here, right?

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,020
But to be honest, I think he kind of likes you.

180
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,820
Stop joking around.

181
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,930
He's just the more emotional type.

182
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,350
If it were someone else, he'd also be like this.

183
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,250
Yes, yes, yes.

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,500
Any news from the police station?

185
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,620
Not yet. Should be soon.

186
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,760
You're really quite kindhearted.

187
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,440
You're only serving as a sparring partner. Why are you exerting yourself so much?

188
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,680
These past few days, being a sparring partner was quite relaxing.

189
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,100
I didn't have to think about anything. It's like a vacation.

190
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,520
That's why you don't like being a courier.

191
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,290
Not having to be on alert. It's not challenging.

192
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,250
My dad.

193
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,070
Hey, Dad. What is it?

194
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm working.

195
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,840
You all want to come see me?

196
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,450
How many?

197
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,290
Six?

198
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,660
No, I'm happy. I'm super happy, Dad.

199
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,930
Then... I'll get a hotel room. My place is too small and won't fit everyone.

200
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,910
Dad. My aunt rarely comes to see me.

201
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,900
It's not appropriate to squeeze everyone at my place.

202
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,990
Alright. I'll listen to you.

203
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,300
I'm hanging up then.

204
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,480
Your family is coming over?

205
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,960
My dad, mom, aunt, uncle, and cousin are coming to visit me.

206
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,360
Isn't that pretty good? It's lively with more people.

207
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,840
Six people's living and eating expenses are another amount of money.

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,580
It's not like you don't know my current situation. At the end of every month,

209
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,590
my dad and mom ask me for money, using all kinds of reasons.

210
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,320
My cousin wants to change his car and they want to help.

211
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,400
They want to help but I contribute the money.

212
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,820
Two days ago, they called, saying they wanted to buy me a house. They would pay the deposit and I'd pay the mortgage.

213
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,270
I'm living here but they want to buy me a house in our hometown.

214
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,900
I...

215
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,070
They're killing me.

216
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,990
Alright, don't be pissed anymore.

217
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,390
Since your family is coming to see you, it is still a happy matter.

218
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,860
Look at me. I'm always by myself.

219
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,270
I'm always spending the new year with either my mom or dad.

220
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,770
You are alone, but it's simple for you.

221
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,970
Our family is filled with relatives here and there.

222
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,060
It's so annoying.

223
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,450
I'll stop now. Heading to the golf course.

224
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,500
What for? Your coach certification?

225
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,430
Of course. You can earn money as a coach.

226
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,180
I'm going.

227
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,500
Sorry, sorry. When I was hitting the ball,

228
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,400
I don't know what I was thinking.

229
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,960
This ball went slanted.

230
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,820
It almost hit you.

231
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,290
It's fine.

232
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,360
This is my first time here,

233
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,980
and I'm not familiar with the course.

234
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,220
Your reason doesn't stand.

235
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,930
One look at you tells me you lack exercise which made you lose your form.

236
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,140
You're so brazen.

237
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,640
You exposed me right away.

238
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,390
To express my sincerity, I'll pay the expenses for this game.

239
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,380
You really don't have to. Thanks.

240
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,860
Hey!

241
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,970
Did you come by yourself?

242
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,650
Why?

243
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,830
I also came by myself.

244
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,400
From what you're saying, you must be good.

245
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,470
How about we compete?

246
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,940
- With me? <br> - Right.

247
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,410
Alright.

248
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,730
Wow, you hit so far.

249
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,390
You really are amazing.

250
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,470
I usually get into my good condition gradually.

251
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,970
I already regret what I said to you earlier.

252
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,470
But I have to grit my teeth and do it.

253
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,510
This is going to be ugly.

254
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,110
Why am I getting nervous?

255
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,920
- How is it? <br> - Your posture is good.

256
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,560
Nothing else?

257
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,410
Nothing else.

258
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,470
- Boss, do you want to use the car? <br> - No need.

259
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,680
- Let's take a walk. <br> - Okay.

260
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,510
I didn't introduce myself yet. My last name is Hou. What is your surname?

261
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,190
You can call me Qian Qian. Nice to meet you, Uncle Hou.

262
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,720
"Uncle Hou?"

263
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,100
Your way of addressing me just

264
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
put a lot of distance between us.

265
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,340
Once I become Uncle Hou to you,

266
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,780
it'd make our conversations more formal.

267
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,300
Also, I didn't prepare New Year's money for you.

268
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,220
Calling you Uncle Hou gets me pocket money? That's no loss.

269
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,130
- Hello, Uncle Hou. <br> - Go ahead then.

270
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,160
Call me uncle then. Let me tell you. You're definitely losing this game.

271
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,500
How about me "Brother Hou?"

272
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,960
No... why does it sound

273
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,910
like the monkey king from Journey to the West?

274
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,570
Call me "President Hou."

275
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,560
Call me "President Hou." That sounds more comfortable.

276
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,850
Alright! Hello, President Hou!

277
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,010
Come in.

278
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,440
President Lan, Wu Shiyi isn't at Zhirong Construction anymore.

279
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,160
She has returned to the security company, and a male bodyguard replaced her.

280
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,220
Cancel my three o'clock meeting. I'm going out.

281
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,010
Okay.

282
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,330
<i>Where are you? I want to see you right away.</i>

283
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,510
<i>I'm at work. It's not convenient.</i>

284
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,870
<i>Don't lie to me. My secretary went to deliver flowers to you at Zhirong Construction.</i>

285
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,880
<i>They say you aren't working there anymore.</i>

286
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,260
<i>What's happened? I need to see you right away.</i>

287
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,660
<i>Okay. I'm in the security company.</i>

288
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,960
<i>Don't tell my parents.</i>

289
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,690
President Hou.

290
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,190
Your golf playing

291
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,390
- is really bad. <br> - Don't be too proud.

292
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,640
Plenty of people make a mistake right before the end. Your turn.

293
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,380
I'll do what I can then.

294
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,090
I'll give you another chance.

295
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,760
Again.

296
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,100
Qian Qian, thank you for today.

297
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,560
I haven't enjoyed playing so much like today.

298
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,470
President Hou, how can you say that? I enjoyed it too.

299
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,210
Also, you are the best golf player

300
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,290
among all the female golf players.

301
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,150
I think you should participate in professional tournaments.

302
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,170
Actually, I have competed before.

303
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,990
My performance was pretty good. I've been thinking of trying

304
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,490
for the medium-level coach license.

305
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,750
I'm off today so I came to practice.

306
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,950
I wondered why your golf playing is so awesome.

307
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,140
Then, what do you do at work?

308
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,450
I am an instructor in a security company,

309
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,930
mainly training the security guards and personal security.

310
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,740
Personal security?

311
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,580
What is a personal security?

312
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,870
It's what you call a bodyguard.

313
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,340
I get it now.

314
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,650
So you are a chief bodyguard. I should've been more respectful.

315
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,970
If I get bullied from now on,

316
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm sure you will protect me immediately, right?

317
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,450
President Hou, you are joking.

318
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,200
You are so fierce and successful. Who dares to bully you?

319
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,310
You. You'd dare to bully me.

320
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,970
Ridiculous. This is pure nonsense.

321
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Thank you for unconditonally believing me.

322
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,920
Your client is a problem. Don't you see?

323
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,310
If he wanted to make you leave, why didn't he just say it openly? Why use such a despicable method?

324
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,830
It has nothing to do with Hou Jue.

325
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,750
Why not? Isn't that woman his girlfriend?

326
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,040
Is it possible that he doesn't know what his girlfriend did?

327
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,530
He really doesn't— <br> - Shiyi.

328
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,990
You are too innocent and believe people too easily. How can you be a bodyguard like this?

329
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,120
Don't worry. The police will handle everything.

330
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,180
The police will do what they should do.

331
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,010
You can't just let them off so easily.

332
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,580
What they've done is harming you.

333
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,090
How about this, I'll find a lawyer for you.

334
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,300
We'll sue them, and make them pay you double in damage compensation.

335
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,310
I don't want any damage compensation. I only

336
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,080
want the truth to come out soon. Otherwise, I'll have to leave this profession.

337
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,300
You should leave even after you're proven innocent.

338
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,460
We're not doing it anymore!

339
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,230
Shiyi, a lot of our classmates

340
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,740
have gotten married, had children, and are living a stable life.

341
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,030
Only you are still outside fighting with your life.

342
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,720
What for?

343
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,030
This job is tiresome and dangerous.

344
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,250
It also makes you suffer grievances.

345
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,640
If you are doing it for Uncle's debit, I'll think of a solution. Okay?

346
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,990
No need. Thank you.

347
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,630
My dad is giving me some pressure.

348
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,160
But, even without my dad, I still wouldn't leave this profession.

349
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,750
I love my work. Only in this work

350
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,110
I can find my self worth.

351
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,940
Okay, I respect your choice.

352
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,770
If you want to continue, then continue, but remember this.

353
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,880
You were on your own before and had to bear everything by yourself.

354
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,250
I'm back now.

355
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,270
No matter what happens,

356
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,320
I am here to help you. Understand?

357
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,930
Thanks.

358
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,050
Let me tell you something.

359
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,960
I actually have some understanding of your profession.

360
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,810
I hired a bodyguard for my son.

361
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,160
That kid has always gotten into trouble outside.

362
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,200
With a bodyguard to follow him and protect him, I feel much better.

363
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,620
President Hou.

364
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,220
Are you Hou Zhirong?

365
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,550
How did you know?

366
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,960
It's true then.

367
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,940
What's the matter?

368
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,120
We were chatting just fine. Why did you suddenly...

369
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,950
got unhappy?

370
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,400
I am unhappy, and I'm very angry.

371
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,100
Why?

372
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,950
Your son... Your son's female friend

373
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,610
has falsely accused my good friend of stealing her necklace. I really don't understand it.

374
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,870
I get it now. Wu Shiyi is your friend.

375
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,840
She is not only my friend,

376
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,380
I understand her very much and it's impossible for her to do succh a thing.

377
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,020
Sorry, I can't eat with you anymore. I'm leaving.

378
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,520
Qian Qian. Qian Qian.

379
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,430
Don't be angry. Sit down first. Sit down first.

380
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,890
Qian Qian, give me a chance to explain, okay?

381
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,190
Actually, I have no impression

382
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,440
of that girl.

383
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,810
Based on my understanding, she and my son Hou Jue

384
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,560
are just regular friends. Didn't I just tell you?

385
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,740
My son always gets into trouble outside. I... I...

386
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,780
I don't even know where he met this bunch of untrustworthy friends

387
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,860
and actually harmed your best friend.

388
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,970
On behalf of my son,

389
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,550
I sincerely apologize to you and your friend. Okay?

390
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:25,690
Also, what the name of the girl you mentioned?

391
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,570
- Fang Lu. <br> - Yes.

392
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,620
That girl called your President Zhao directly.

393
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,970
I really didn't know. If I had known,

394
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,430
I wouldn't have let Wu Shiyi gone back.

395
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,630
President Hou, can you plase

396
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,900
call our President Zhou yourself?

397
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,220
What the client says is very persuasive.

398
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,790
I can. How about this, let me understand the situation first.

399
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,180
I don't want a good person to be falsely charged. Isn't that right?

400
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,480
I also don't want a good person to be falsely charged.

401
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,790
I'll take this call.

402
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,270
Hello. Speak.

403
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,520
I'm busy outside, can't go back.

404
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,980
Trivial matters like this, you can just handle them from now on by yourselves.

405
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,580
Okay? Don't call me anymore.

406
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,320
- What's the matter? <br> - It's about the company.

407
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,220
The company's affairs aren't important. Let's eat.

408
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,390
Work is important. We can eat again. Let's go.

409
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:39,200
Huh? We can eat again?

410
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,850
Then... Then... Let's connect on WeChat then.

411
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,810
It'll be easier to arrange to meet again. Let's add WeChat then.

412
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,010
I'll scan your code.

413
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,920
President Hou, about my friend Shiyi, please help.

414
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,680
Sure. No problem.

415
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,050
- I'll leave first then. <br> - Goodbye.

416
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,840
We'll meet another day then, okay?

417
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,610
<i>(Hou Shirong bio)</i>

418
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,380
- Director Jr Hou, someone's here to see you. <br>- Who?

419
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,230
Who?

420
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,860
It's been awhile, Director Jr Hou.

421
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,770
- You are... <br>- Lan Qi.

422
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,560
Right, that's right.

423
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
What is it? Have a seat and let's talk.

424
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm good. Let's cut to the chase.

425
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm here about Shiyi.

426
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,330
- You know already? <br>- Yes.

427
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,330
She told me. It's a real blow to her.

428
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,730
Her career was also completely destroyed.

429
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,440
Yes.

430
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,160
You should know however deeply you were involved

431
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,200
you won't be able to get away with this.

432
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,200
So I'm here to tell you,

433
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,770
from now on, she's not alone,

434
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,590
I'll always support her.

435
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,950
I'm done. Goodbye.

436
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,960
Wait... What department are you in?

437
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,270
What's wrong with him?

438
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,800
Hi, do you remember me?

439
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,590
How can I help you?

440
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,740
I bought a necklace in this row about two days ago.

441
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,490
- It was quite big, remember? <br>- I remember.

442
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,750
I want to buy another one exactly the same.

443
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,640
I'm so sorry. It's been sold out.

444
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,570
Can you check if it's in another place?

445
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,560
- Let me check for you, please wait. <br>- Yes, quickly.

446
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,790
I'm sorry. It's a limited edition. It's sold out. It's all gone.

447
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,800
- Nowhere else in the country? <br>- It's all gone.

448
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,140
All right.

449
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,010
Thanks.

450
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,800
It's so cheap.

451
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,520
Triple refund if it's fake.

452
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,590
It must be real.

453
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,520
Monkey, so... I've found the necklace for you.

454
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,890
It looks exactly the same. It says triple refund if it's fake. The reviews are not bad.

455
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,700
Don't worry.

456
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,040
It's a nice necklace at ths price.

457
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,170
This is the second round for this draft plan.

458
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,700
Yet it's like this.

459
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,580
Tell the designer director

460
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,770
to redo the plan!

461
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,460
Did they not get paid?

462
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,850
They come to work and put in no effort at all.

463
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,740
Boss, hi.

464
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,480
Sister Shiyi, do you want some chili sauce?

465
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,510
No, you eat. Thanks.

466
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,710
- Sister Shiyi. <br>- Almost done.

467
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,810
Who are you talking to you? Smiling so sweet.

468
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,200
My friend.

469
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,930
<i>Who says I'm your boss?</i>

470
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,540
<i>You never agreed to it.</i>

471
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,530
<i>But I've already agreed to be your subordinate.</i>

472
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,010
<i>It's fine if you refused me, but you will need to write me a resignation letter.</i>

473
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,100
<i>Once I sign it, it will be effectively immediately.</i>

474
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,950
<i>Then wouldn't you become the boss?</i>

475
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,960
<i>I'm serious. Be my private coach?</i>

476
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,180
<i>It won't take up much time. Once a week is enough.</i>

477
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,970
<i>I'll pay.</i>

478
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,140
<i>I'll consider it.</i>

479
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,280
<i>What about the thing this coach asked you to do?</i>

480
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,310
<i>I did it as soon as I could.</i>

481
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,610
<i>The police understands our stance now.</i>

482
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,590
That's not an ordinary friend.

483
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,140
- What? <br>- Because your smile is not normal.

484
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,780
Really?

485
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,640
Your "really?" is full of subtext.

486
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,940
Spit it out, which stage did you reach?

487
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,680
When will you have him meet me and get my approval?

488
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,630
It's just a platonic friend. We've only met once.

489
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,280
For us...

490
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,190
it's impossible.

491
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,890
Why is it impossible?

492
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,870
The soup is good.

493
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,040
The potato is also good.

494
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,610
Why not?

495
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:07,480
God, look at you. We were done with it. <br>It's all about the soup now. Why are you still on that?

496
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,420
Let's eat. Eat.

497
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,550
What're you thinking? <br>Here.

498
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,830
To celebrate our bright future.

499
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,190
Three, two, one. <br>Cheese.

500
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,380
Waiter, a cup of coffee please.

501
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,960
Happy? How are you doing lately?

502
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,940
Didn't you see my black eyes?

503
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,910
What happened?

504
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,450
I couldn't sleep well.

505
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,810
After that thing happened, <br>I've been guilty.

506
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,860
If Hou Jue found out...

507
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,820
I... I couldn't even imagine <br>what he would do.

508
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,700
My lady, just rest one hundred percent assured.

509
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,960
It is only between us. No one else knows about it. <br>How would he know?

510
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Besides, if he knows, he will do something.

511
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,850
But he... <br> Hi, your coffee.

512
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,950
OK. Thanks.

513
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,460
Go on.

514
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,780
He didn't do anything indeed.

515
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,010
But... <br> When I sent him message on wechat,

516
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,520
he was very cold to me. <br>He barely replied to me.

517
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,730
When I said we could have dinner together,

518
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,040
he would say no rush.

519
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,810
See,

520
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,150
he's so understanding. <br>He didn't want to disturb your work.

521
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,190
So listen to him. <br>Ask him for dinner after you come back from Dubai.

522
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,600
Mary,

523
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,230
I'm begging you.

524
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,760
I can't go there.

525
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,200
I've known Hou Jue for many days.

526
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,610
I really like him.

527
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,170
I don't know how he thinks of me,

528
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,230
but I can never do anything that hurts him.

529
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,970
Fang Lu.

530
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Will you be grateful?

531
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,130
I just helped you getting rid of you enemy.

532
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,480
But you just turned around<br> and kicked me out.

533
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,740
Do you think it's proper?

534
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,640
No, I didn't mean that.

535
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,460
I just don't want to go to Dubai. <br>That's all.

536
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,350
Anyways,

537
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,050
I won't go

538
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,110
FANG LU!

539
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,460
What do you mean?

540
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,860
We've best friends for years.

541
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,440
But you're doing this to me?

542
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,590
They've bought the air ticket.

543
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,490
The flight to Dubai departs tomorrow.

544
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,200
Yet you told me you wouldn't go? <br>What should I say to them?

545
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,150
If you did regard me as your friend,

546
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,600
would you even consider for me?

547
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,390
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,540
Sorry?

549
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,840
It seems you're ready to give<br> up everything now, right?

550
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,500
Fine.

551
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,630
Years of our friendship is nothing.

552
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,480
Right.

553
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,160
Your necklace.

554
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,990
Mary.

555
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,020
This necklace... <br> please take it as my compensation for you.

556
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,620
Okay?

557
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:48,060
