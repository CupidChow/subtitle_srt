00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,239
Congratulations.

5
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,319
Hello, everyone.

6
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,159
Hello. I'm Huang Yue's good friend.

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,480
My name is Hou Jue.

8
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
Today,

9
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,480
I am representing Huang Yue's 50 ex-boyfriends...

10
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
to wish her a happy marriage.

11
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,200
Who is he?

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
- I don't know. - Why is he talking nonsense?

13
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Have you seen him before?

14
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,760
Huang Yue and I have spent a lot of time together.

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,319
We all know that Huang Yue is especially loyal...

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
in a relationship.

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,239
What kind of person is she?

18
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,319
She's not a person who can control her desires.

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,560
When you give her love, she would ask for money.

20
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,919
When you give her money, she would ask for some space.

21
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,039
When you give her space, she would ask for freedom.

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,090
When you give her freedom, she would want you to be romantic.

23
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,479
Listen.

24
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,240
But today...

25
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,840
What's your name again? Bai Quan.

26
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,090
Even though it's you who are getting married,

27
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,759
I'm happier about it than you are.

28
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,530
I'd like to thank you on behalf of everyone...

29
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,599
for getting rid of the cancer of the society.

30
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,159
Well...

31
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,240
I didn't come empty-handed.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
I came here with your wedding gift too.

33
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,879
Look! It's a giant diamond ring!

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,530
It's the kind of stuff you can't afford.

35
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,810
Over 50 of your ex-boyfriends...

36
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,919
pooled together money and bought it for you.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,039
Keep it.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Please take it.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,319
Lastly, I'll sing a song for you.

40
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,080
Hear me out.

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,639
"Where is spring?"

42
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,639
- Enough. What are you doing? - Where is spring?

43
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,919
You've gone too far.

44
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,000
- Where is spring? - What are you doing?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
What are you doing? Don't go overboard!

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,159
- Get out of my way! - Get out of my way!

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
You...

48
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,639
- Throw him out! - Throw him out!

49
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,520
Why are you only telling the truth?

50
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,599
Stop right there!

51
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,759
Stop!

52
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,280
Hou Jue, you scoundrel!

53
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,479
Get him!

54
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,610
It's such a coincidence.

55
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,879
I parked my car at the back of the hotel.

56
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,959
How lucky.

57
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,279
It's not a coincidence.

58
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,959
I did my homework.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
- Is that so? - She's professional.

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
My cousin is so smart.

61
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,480
Is that so?

62
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
Hold on.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,519
Did you really give that ring to Huang Yue?

64
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,560
I gave it to her. I put it in her hand first.

65
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,959
I'm so mad at you.

66
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,439
We could have saved the money. Are you crazy?

67
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,000
When I saw her face,

68
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,170
I feel really great.

69
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,639
- It's so exciting. - That's true.

70
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,120
It's really satisfying.

71
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
Today,

72
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,879
I'm going to name it...

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
the most meaningful day ever.

74
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,560
I'll give you 100 points today.

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,839
It's absolutely meaningful.

76
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,279
I bet tonight,

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,319
they will be mapping out for a divorce.

78
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,959
You're a good singer.

79
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
Where is spring?

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
- Where is spring? - Where is spring?

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,120
- Spring is in the eyes - Spring is in the eyes

82
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,399
- Of that little boy - Of that little boy

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
- There are red flowers - There are red flowers

84
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,079
- And green grasses - And green grasses

85
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,560
And also the little singing oriole

86
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,800
You may leave now. I'll do it myself.

87
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,879
Okay.

88
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,920
Thank you.

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,519
Get changed. We have a toast to make.

90
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,839
What's your relationship with him?

91
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,480
Okay.

92
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,560
I admit, we used to be in a relationship...

93
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,759
but that's all in the past.

94
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,240
It has long passed...

95
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
and things are impossible between us.

96
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,639
We're not done yet, Huang Yue.

97
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,480
My parents are...

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,639
against the idea of we getting married so soon.

99
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,240
Your ex-boyfriend...

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
humiliated me in front of everyone.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,600
You have to come clean today.

102
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,079
Are you two still together?

103
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,439
Otherwise, I can't answer to my parents, relatives, and friends.

104
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,399
He's a lunatic.

105
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,639
I don't know why he caused such a scene earlier.

106
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,160
And it's already over between us.

107
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,839
My parents and family are all here.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,639
If I don't mean it,

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
would I marry you?

110
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,720
He made a scene...

111
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,079
because you're still in his heart.

112
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,199
With his behavior,

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,199
who on earth dares to date him?

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,600
- Hey! - Mr. Li.

115
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
Da Peng, you're back!

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,279
Mr. Li, we have elevators here.

117
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,519
Why are you using the stairs?

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
It's an exercise.

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Why did you break down the newly installed door?

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,120
It's a long story.

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,240
Mr. Li, let's talk inside.

122
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,480
Okay.

123
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,000
Have some tea, Uncle.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,079
All right.

125
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,360
Mr. Li, you're our reference,

126
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
so I won't hide it from you.

127
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,279
I broke up with Shi Yi.

128
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,319
How did this happen?

129
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
We didn't spend much time together.

130
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
She sealed off your door.

131
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,319
Was it because you have wronged her?

132
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,639
No, Mr. Li. Absolutely not.

133
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll be honest with you.

134
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,960
Shi Yi got together with one of her clients.

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,799
I ran into them on the street.

136
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,450
As for the details...

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
I won't get into the details. I bet you can understand.

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,120
She doesn't seem like the type to do such a thing.

139
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,559
I thought so too.

140
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,399
I've never suspected her.

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,679
But I was fooled by her.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,799
She said she had to work and didn't have time for me.

143
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,210
Now I understand.

144
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,759
She ended up giving all her time to that client.

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,799
How did this happen?

146
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,210
Why did she install a security door to lock you away?

147
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,279
I don't know.

148
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,600
You know what? I think...

149
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,450
She probably hates that I bumped into them.

150
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,720
Bless me, God of Wealth.

151
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,360
I hope today is better than yesterday.

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,840
This month is better than last month.

153
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,159
Please let me attract wealth from every direction.

154
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,639
Please bless us.

155
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,360
Shake it up!

156
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,330
Here comes the private collection.

157
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,120
Sir, here are your noodles.

158
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,960
We can't go on like this. Are you rebelling?

159
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,159
That's enough meat for three bowls.

160
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,090
Why are you giving it to me? Are you crazy?

161
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,679
You don't know.

162
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,639
This is the leftover beef from yesterday.

163
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,919
It's not fresh.

164
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,600
We can't sell it to the customers.

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,919
So, I cooked them for you.

166
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,759
You have done the right thing.

167
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,600
Did you see a girl who just passed through?

168
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,450
A girl?

169
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,600
Who on earth just passed through?

170
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,039
Sir!

171
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,799
Who are you?

172
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,639
How is it? Don't I look different today?

173
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,519
Isn't it very fashionable?

174
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,159
You're way too stylish.

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,759
Who are you?

176
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,090
Gosh, sir.

177
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,480
I've been here for over a month.

178
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,919
I'm Dolly. How could you not remember?

179
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,960
Yes, you do look like a doll.

180
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,000
What happened to you?

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,279
Why did you apply Mr. Tian's flour and seasonings...

182
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,450
all over your face?

183
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
How can you say that?

184
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,759
Two days ago,

185
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,519
my friend took me to a great 10 dollar shop.

186
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,919
I walked in and took a look.

187
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,279
There's so much stuff,

188
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,600
so I bought a lot of them.

189
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,159
I have applied everything on my face today.

190
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,399
My gosh.

191
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,399
Dolly, I'll give you 10 minutes.

192
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,330
Remove the seasoning on your face first.

193
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,159
No wonder there were no customers this morning.

194
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,799
Come on, you have 10 minutes.

195
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,519
How annoying. You should appreciate it more.

196
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,720
My gosh.

197
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,600
Hello.

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,320
The 17th blind date is over.

199
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,559
That soon?

200
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,320
What happened this time?

201
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,600
Don't get me started. It is hard to say it all at once.

202
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,000
How are things on your side? Has it stopped?

203
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,879
No.

204
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,960
I had a dream last night about ironing clothes.

205
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,320
I was exhausted.

206
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,440
I've been wondering why I woke up.

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,639
I get it now.

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,399
My client is too fussy.

209
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,919
I've been trying to figure out how to make it smooth.

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,240
Is he really so hard to please?

211
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,200
I'll drop by in the afternoon for a client visit.

212
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,559
Let me deal with him.

213
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,919
Shi Yi.

214
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm having Hai Xing Fried Rice for lunch.

215
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm hanging up.

216
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,120
Hai Xing.

217
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,840
One large serving of Hai Xing Fried Rice,

218
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,039
with more meat and a portion of vegetables as the side dish.

219
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,480
We are leaving in half an hour.

220
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,840
Did you bad-mouth me again?

221
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,200
Yes.

222
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,360
You're quite honest.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,360
What did you say? I'm listening.

224
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,000
I was saying you don't train properly at all...

225
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
and you're eavesdropping on people's phone calls.

226
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
Shi Yi.

227
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
Let me ask you.

228
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,559
No, I won't.

229
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,879
But yes, I will.

230
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,519
What do you mean? I haven't even asked.

231
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,000
Didn't you just want to know if I would follow you in?

232
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,399
I won't follow you right now,

233
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,600
but if anything happens in there,

234
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,879
I'll go in.

235
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,200
If you don't eat noodles with garlic,

236
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,240
you're basically wasting the food. Here, I'll peel it for you.

237
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,919
If I eat noodles with garlic, what would the customers feel?

238
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,600
We're in the service industry.

239
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,200
You can't serve the customers with that garlic smell.

240
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
You need to change your mindset.

241
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,200
Learn from Mr. Tian.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,639
You're so absent-minded.

243
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,639
All right.

244
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,679
In that case,

245
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,600
let's keep the garlic for supper tonight.

246
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,879
I bought a lot anyway.

247
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,200
I bought 10kg.

248
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
10kg? You're crazy.

249
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,639
Why did you buy so much garlic?

250
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,720
Sir, don't worry.

251
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,679
I ran into my hometown friend.

252
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,879
He insisted on selling it.

253
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,159
How much do you think he charged me for that?

254
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,159
How much is it?

255
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,960
It's two yuan.

256
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Not bad. You have a trick up your sleeve.

257
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,840
- Aren't I amazing? - You deserve praise.

258
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
It's commendable.

259
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,480
I've long considered Xing and Eight Guests as my home.

260
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,879
I especially like that.

261
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,919
Look over there.

262
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,799
From now on, Xing and Eight Guests will be your home.

263
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,120
From now on, Xing and Eight Guests will be your battlefield.

264
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,879
Okay, sir.

265
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,000
In order for me to fight better in this battlefield,

266
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,919
can I get a separate room?

267
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,039
Rent is too expensive now. I'm really overwhelmed, sir.

268
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,399
I can't do that.

269
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,279
Do you know why it is called Xing and Eight Guests?

270
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,480
If I give you a room,

271
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I'll have to change the name to Xing and Six Guests.

272
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,399
There are four rooms in total. Each room can fit two people.

273
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,000
Hence, the hut can fit eight people in total.

274
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,799
What is my name?

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,759
I see, it is Hai Xing's restaurant.

276
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,600
That's why it's called Xing and Eight Guests.

277
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,759
Sir, you're so talented.

278
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,840
Go. Get rid of your makeup.

279
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Remove your flour.

280
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,200
I'm going to deduct your pay.

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,639
All right.

282
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,639
Make sure it's clean.

283
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,759
A little girl should look simple.

284
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,919
- You've arrived, Hai Xing. - Nice outfit.

285
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,320
Make this figure...

286
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,240
- The data can be... - Handsome Ma.

287
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Are you here again for a delivery?

288
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,399
Mr. Hou Junior is too picky with food.

289
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,679
I have to serve him well.

290
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,440
I have no choice.

291
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,639
Hello.

292
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,279
Excuse me. Where is Mr. Hou Jue's office?

293
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,279
Turn here and go straight.

294
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,120
Just go to the room without any sign on the door.

295
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
Do you have an appointment?

296
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,759
I have an appointment. Thank you.

297
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,799
She's so pretty.

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,320
That's right. How elegant.

299
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,000
Hello.

300
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm Qian Xiao Yan from Eagle Security.

301
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm here for a client visit.

302
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,159
Hello. Have a seat.

303
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,360
Thank you.

304
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,679
Are you Mr. Hou Jue?

305
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,410
Have you eaten?

306
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,519
Let's eat something first.

307
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,920
It's okay. I'm not hungry, thank you.

308
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
I made this myself.

309
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,799
It's called Hai Xing Fried Rice.

310
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,039
It's quite delicious.

311
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,890
I didn't know you cook for yourself.

312
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
That's right. It's healthy.

313
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,119
Don't worry, the fried rice doesn't contain starfish.

314
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,680
It's just a name.

315
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,079
It's pretty good. Try it.

316
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,170
Try it. It's really good.

317
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,410
No, thank you.

318
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're a promising young man.

319
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,960
Look at you.

320
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,720
You really look...

321
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,079
like a designer.

322
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,759
Really?

323
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,920
Do I really look like one?

324
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,170
So you're a bodyguard?

325
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,319
I'm a trainer. I don't go out into the field.

326
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
You are a leader.

327
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,319
That's a lot of responsibility.

328
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,759
Today, I'm here to ask...

329
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,839
if you are satisfied with Wu Shi Yi's work?

330
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,599
Yes.

331
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,079
I'm satisfied.

332
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,799
It's because my...

333
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,720
I mean, you should give Shi Yi a lot of credit.

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,920
She has a good image, right?

335
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,279
She is also skilled.

336
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,720
She is a good driver too.

337
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,890
She is responsible and right on time.

338
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,480
If you ask me, she's really good.

339
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,519
Really.

340
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,480
Is that really what you think of her?

341
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Yes.

342
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,039
Anyway, I think if it's possible,

343
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,720
I would have hired her for the rest of my life.

344
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,079
Mr. Hou Jue, thank you very much.

345
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,039
Thank you for your support in our work.

346
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,559
No, I should thank you.

347
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,279
As you can see, only a responsible instructor like you...

348
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,039
could train such an outstanding...

349
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
female bodyguard.

350
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,650
Thank you.

351
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,839
Does all the female bodyguards...

352
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,000
need to fulfill high image requirement?

353
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,519
I mean, it's all about image.

354
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,410
Are you having a date?

355
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,519
Qian Qian.

356
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,759
- Why did you come back? - Here you are.

357
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,759
Shi Yi.

358
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,319
- Who is she? - Here's your food.

359
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,410
Hou Jue.

360
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,170
This is our instructor of Eagle Security, Qian Xiao Yan.

361
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,799
Hello, Mr. Hou Jue.

362
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,440
Hello.

363
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,759
I'm here for a client visit.

364
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I heard...

365
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,200
you're very impressed with Wu Shi Yi's work.

366
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,079
Impressed? I never said that.

367
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,480
If I understood correctly,

368
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,599
this gentleman said...

369
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,480
you're very satisfied with Wu Shi Yi's work.

370
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,559
Are you impressed with her?

371
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,359
Well, isn't my cousin good at work?

372
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,410
Very good.

373
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,319
Shouldn't you listen to my opinion?

374
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,079
What about the lifetime employment?

375
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,279
Lifetime employment? Are you trying to rip me off?

376
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,960
No, I...

377
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,200
It's a misunderstanding.

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,119
This gentleman is...

379
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,279
He is my son.

380
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,559
He meant I'm his son's godfather to be.

381
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,170
He...

382
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,839
Hai Xing, that's my name.

383
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,319
Hello.

384
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,119
Hello.

385
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,039
Mr. Hou Jue.

386
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,000
You have such a negative opinion about Wu Shi Yi.

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,359
May I ask why?

388
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,279
That's a long list.

389
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,839
Let me tell you why.

390
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,480
First of all,

391
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,410
she doesn't listen to me.

392
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,359
She always follows me around.

393
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,680
She follows me around when I ask her so.

394
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,599
She insists on following me around even when I stop her from doing so.

395
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,920
Isn't it irritating?

396
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,960
And she's always talking behind my back.

397
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
I really can't accept it.

398
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,200
She follows you around 24 hours a day?

399
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
Mr. Hou Jue.

400
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,599
That's Wu Shi Yi's job.

401
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,410
Also,

402
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,319
she always stands on the moral high ground.

403
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,170
She criticized and educated me.

404
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,170
Tell me.

405
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,650
How dare you criticize your client?

406
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,359
Education? She is not supposed to educate her client.

407
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,000
How about this?

408
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,960
In the future, whatever needs to be discussed,

409
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,890
you can talk to me if you have any problems.

410
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,650
I'll try my best to coordinate with you.

411
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,759
What do you think?

412
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,960
- So I can complain? - Yes.

413
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,960
That means you're still a reputable company.

414
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,599
I hereby lodge a complaint against her.

415
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,559
I'd like you to go back and work on her education.

416
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,079
Manage her well.

417
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,200
I want her to reflect on herself,

418
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,599
find out her mistakes

419
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,920
and fix them.

420
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,319
Okay?

421
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,720
Okay.

422
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,920
It's easier to communicate through WeChat.

423
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,480
Add her on WeChat.

424
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,359
Wait, why would I add her on WeChat?

425
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,410
That's not a good idea.

426
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,519
It's inconvenient, right?

427
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,799
How about that?

428
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,890
I'll transfer it to you. I'll transfer it to him.

429
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,240
You don't have your phone with you, is it?

430
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll scan the code first.

431
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,920
Three lives? That's a nice name.

432
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,839
I...

433
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,079
I will transfer it to him.

434
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,079
Thank you.

435
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,759
If you are done talking,

436
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,839
you may go for lunch now.

437
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,039
All right.

438
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,599
I won't disturb you then.

439
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,640
Bye.

440
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,000
- Thanks for coming. - Thanks for coming.

441
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,759
Don't forget to educate her.

442
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,680
Why did you come back so early?

443
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,799
Do you like her?

444
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
- What? - Your eyes are about to fall out.

445
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,039
You're pathetic.

446
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
- You must be hungry. - It's okay.

447
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,960
Is there something wrong...

448
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,599
with Mr. Hou Jue's friend?

449
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,960
No, he is nice...

450
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,319
and very capable.

451
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,319
He runs a restaurant and a guest house of his own.

452
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
He's quite hardworking.

453
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
Perhaps he was nervous...

454
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,599
when you were around.

455
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,279
How was the blind date? Tell me about it.

456
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,000
Don't get me started.

457
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,759
This man is loaded...

458
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,119
and handsome.

459
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,960
I'm sure he'll find someone to marry,

460
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,680
but I'm sure it's not me.

461
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,480
Every time you meet someone,

462
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,200
you find different problems.

463
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,880
You don't date an uncultured person.

464
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,599
You reject those who are not making good money.

465
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,519
What are you looking for?

466
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm not asking for anything.

467
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,920
As long as I have feelings for him.

468
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,079
Okay.

469
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,000
That's the hardest.

470
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,039
It's a bit salty.

471
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,720
Get me some water.

472
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:33,440
No, I'm screwed.

473
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,039
Who's screwed?

474
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,240
I'm screwed.

475
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,279
What's wrong?

476
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm in love.

477
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,519
What happened to you?

478
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,799
She is the one.

479
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,160
Let me take a look.

480
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,039
Look at this.

481
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,799
I can't believe it. Look at this.

482
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,400
What does she usually do in life?

483
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,240
She always feeds the stray cats.

484
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,559
How loving.

485
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,599
And look.

486
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,839
She exercises a lot.

487
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,440
Hitting 300 yards with a wooden drive?

488
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,279
How many meters is that?

489
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,839
- It's quite far. - It's far.

490
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,640
Look at her.

491
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
Look at her outfit.

492
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,359
She has good taste.

493
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,920
Her body, her image...

494
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,960
In many ways, I think...

495
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,559
she's prettier than my cousin.

496
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,680
- That's great. - Really great.

497
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
- I think she's perfect. - Perfect.

498
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
She is totally my cup of tea.

499
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,079
But she is not for you.

500
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,279
Why do you think so? I think she's great.

501
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,640
You can't handle her.

502
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
- I'm telling you. - What do you mean?

503
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,960
Women are to be respected. We should look up to them.

504
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,640
And unlike you,

505
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm looking for a wife.

506
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,480
She's the one.

507
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,400
Hai Xing, let me tell you something.

508
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
I'm trying to be considerate here...

509
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,640
so that I won't discourage you.

510
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,599
But you really stand no chance.

511
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,480
She is the one.

512
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,319
Stop looking.

513
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,240
It's the taste of love.

514
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,359
It's sweet.

515
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,039
The world is sweet now.

516
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,559
You are useless.

517
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,319
My dad called me yesterday asking for money again.

518
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:56,960
Do you know how much he wants?

519
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,799
Two hundred thousand yuan.

520
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,000
Where can I get him that much money?

521
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,079
I send my family money every month.

522
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,119
I really don't know what they did with all that money.

523
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,680
My hometown is a small place.

524
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,720
The living expenses are so low.

525
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,240
Why do they need so much money?

526
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,119
Look at us.

527
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,519
You and I are in the same boat.

528
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,079
Tell me.

529
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
If I don't marry someone...

530
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,680
who is well-off,

531
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,519
I will be dragged down by my family.

532
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,240
What if...

533
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,160
there is someone who loves you very much...

534
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,720
and especially nice to you,

535
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,599
but he is just not well-off?

536
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,079
That's all the more reason I don't dare to agree.

537
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,119
I can't take advantage of him.

538
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,599
Even kinship is unreliable,

539
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,079
not to mention love.

540
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,559
My dear professor Linda,

541
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,079
thank you for your concern.

542
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,559
I'm sure you know why I'm back.

543
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,559
I can't disobey my dad.

544
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,319
When I came back,

545
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,759
I was also very disappointed.

546
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,599
The company's design concept...

547
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,519
is as stiff and stubborn just like my dad.

548
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,079
It's not creative enough.

549
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,839
In the entire company,

550
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,319
I can't find any colleagues who share the same ideas as me.

551
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,440
They're all just echo bugs.

552
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,000
I am deeply saddened.

553
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,960
Did you see that?

554
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,400
Are you sure that the email came from you?

555
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Yes.

556
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,960
Hello, is this Security Department?

557
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,160
I'm Wu Shi Yi.

558
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,319
Okay. Got it.

559
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,720
The Security Department has called the police.

560
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:42,799
Hello.

561
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,400
Okay, I'm on my way.

562
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,079
We work so hard every day.

563
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,480
- Stop talking. - It's unexpected.

564
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,640
- That's right. - How could he say that?

565
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,799
What are you talking about?

566
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,680
I know you read the screenshot of the email.

567
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
My computer was hacked.

568
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,720
I wrote the email. What's the matter?

569
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,279
Get back to work!

570
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,000
I had Ma Yong draw up a statement...

571
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,880
to announce to the entire company...

572
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,240
that the email incident...

573
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,480
was a complete fabrication and defamation.

574
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,519
You should cooperate with the release of the statement.

575
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,839
It's okay to be angry.

576
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,119
You have to tell the whole company...

577
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,559
that you didn't write this email.

578
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,839
It's not you.

579
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,359
I just admitted to the Design Team...

580
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,519
that I wrote the email.

581
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,920
That's how I really feel.

582
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,640
Think about the bigger picture.

583
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,519
If you don't say anything,

584
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,759
not only will you lower my reputation in the company,

585
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,559
but you'll also make everyone in the company...

586
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,599
reject you.

587
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,200
Let them be.

588
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,400
So what?

589
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,759
Anyway, I won't apologize.

590
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,799
I won't explain either.

591
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,039
That's how I really feel.

592
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,799
Your opinion doesn't matter right now.

593
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,960
Those thoughts are no longer in your heart.

594
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,480
They are now playing on everyone's mind.

595
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,160
You must take responsibility for this.

596
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,440
Why should I?

597
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,799
Shouldn't it be the responsibility of the person...

598
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,920
who hacked my computer?

599
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,400
That's the police's business.

600
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,480
Let's see.

601
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,160
You haven't accomplished anything.

602
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,480
Who are you to laugh at others?

603
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,839
You can't say that.

604
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,119
When the cook is terrible,

605
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,680
can't I complain about the bad dishes?

606
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,920
How good am I?

607
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,119
You'll know...

608
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,039
once you see my report in the meeting.

609
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,079
Don't get angry for no reason.

610
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,359
You're bragging.

611
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Hello, Ma Yong.

612
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,279
Release the statement.

613
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,920
Why?

614
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,759
Just follow what I said.

615
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,519
I'm following up on the Haicheng No. 8 Project.

616
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,759
This morning, I just finished drafting the proposal.

617
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Let's take a look.

618
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,400
If you have any comments, feel free to voice them.

619
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,519
I want to be able to have an honest conversation with you.

620
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
(The proposal of Haicheng No. 8 Project)

621
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,559
What on earth are you doing, Hou Jue?

622
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,680
My design plan has been hacked by the hacker.

623
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,079
Are you done with the show?

624
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,480
What's there to act about?

625
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,279
The meeting is adjourned.

626
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,599
Hou Jue can stay.

627
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,079
I said, the meeting is adjourned!

628
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,079
I have to deliver the proposal today.

629
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,839
You completely messed up your work.

630
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,160
Does work even matter to you?

631
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,359
I'm not taking work lightly.

632
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,640
You look down on someone today...

633
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,200
and another one tomorrow.

634
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,920
Did you use it as your capital?

635
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,079
Don't you trust me?

636
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,039
I told you I finished the project. I completed it.

637
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,200
No one believes what you said is true...

638
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,279
more than I do.

639
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,279
You're my dad.

640
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,319
Why can't you trust me?

641
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,799
- What proof do you have? - I can't prove it!

642
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,240
I can prove it.

643
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,839
Mr. Hou, please take a look at this.

644
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,359
Mr. Hou Junior stayed up all night working.

645
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,920
He was so tired that he fell asleep.

646
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Okay.

647
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Thank you.

648
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,359
I'm sorry, son.

649
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,920
I was wrong about you.

650
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,400
Of course you do.

651
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,279
I'll go and get the project back on track.

652
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I'll try to make it in time for the tender.

653
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,559
It's okay.

654
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,759
Your plan must have been leaked.

655
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,200
It's worthless now.

656
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
What should we do then?

657
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,319
I'll find a way.

658
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,079
Hou Jue.

659
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,079
Let me ask you something.

660
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,759
I heard you...

661
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,039
went on the rescue mission again.

662
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,799
Didn't you promise me...

663
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,519
you won't do that again?

664
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,119
If I had known...

665
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,680
that you won't listen to me,

666
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,319
I probably wouldn't hire just one Wu Shi Yi.

667
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,880
I would probably hire two...

668
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,000
or three.

669
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,759
Hou Jue, you're an adult.

670
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,359
You need to learn how to think in other people's shoes.

671
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:55,000
In order to protect you, Wu Shi Yi...

672
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,680
is always on guard.

673
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,319
It's a lot of work.

674
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,319
Do you think that's appropriate?

675
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,920
If she can't put up with the workload,

676
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,960
she can quit.

677
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,519
I wasn't looking for a bodyguard, was I?

678
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,329
If you don't like it,

679
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,289
go and sign a contract with the security company...

680
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
and pay up.

681
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,599
That's it.

682
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,880
You want to stop me from joining the rescue mission, right?

683
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,329
No way.

684
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,480
And...

685
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,329
I don't need a bodyguard.

686
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,639
I do!

687
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,920
I need her to protect you, understand?

688
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:35,559
You're my son.

689
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,840
You can keep her.

690
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,719
You may go.

691
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,329
Mr. Hou, are you all right?

692
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,039
I'm fine.

693
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,769
Thank you.

694
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:28,880
Have a seat.

695
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,480
The police officers...

696
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,880
just left after the investigation.

697
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,599
What did they say?

698
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,480
They said...

699
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,079
this hacker...

700
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,159
hacked into the system...

701
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,329
by spreading a virus.

702
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,599
They mostly focus on the company's computers.

703
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
They also gave us a reminder.

704
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,719
The hacker didn't cause any damage...

705
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,159
to the company's computers.

706
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,199
But all the information in Hou Jue's computer...

707
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,519
especially his proposal...

708
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,599
cannot be retrieved.

709
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,400
That's my guess.

710
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:07,809
And...

711
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,920
now that we lost the proposal,

712
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,809
should we withdraw from the tender?

713
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Of course not.

714
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,440
No doubt this is a small project,

715
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,119
but what's more important...

716
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,239
is the collaboration with Haicheng Group in the future.

717
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,239
That's why...

718
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,840
we must take part in the tender.

719
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,039
Hello.

720
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,000
Take a break.

721
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,519
I'll buy you some coffee.

722
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,559
Buy me some coffee?

723
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,769
Sure.

724
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,480
It's on sale these days.

725
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,769
- Have a seat. - It's very cheap.

726
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:22,079
- Of course. - Good morning, Mr. Hou Junior.

727
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:23,960
- I'll send you the link. - Sure.

728
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,360
Hold on.

729
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,400
Let me do it.

730
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,239
Let me make you some coffee.

731
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,880
You are about to experience...

732
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,960
the right way to make...

733
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
a perfect cup of instant coffee.

734
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:38,769
First step, tear the package open...

735
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,440
and don't put too much in.

736
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,159
For a mug this size,

737
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,000
let's pour only 70 percent of the powder.

738
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,480
And then,

739
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,039
make sure the water is around 83 degree Celsius.

740
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,289
It fits perfectly.

741
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,920
Melt it.

742
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,440
Pick up the stick.

743
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,880
Stir it to the left and right.

744
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:07,519
A perfect cup of instant coffee is ready.

745
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,329
Try it.

746
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,960
How is it?

747
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,159
Not bad.

748
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,119
It does taste like instant coffee.

749
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:23,480
The pour-over coffee is out of stock.

750
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,000
I can only explain this to you.

751
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,159
Although it's instant coffee,

752
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,719
it's full of my gratitude for you.

753
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,639
Thank you for today.

754
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,679
You're welcome.

755
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,079
I was just saying...

756
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,599
what I saw with my own eyes.

757
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,809
I knew it.

758
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:39,920
Look at you.

759
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,769
You have a bad temper and terrible personality,

760
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,639
but you're a very honest person.

761
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,039
That impressed me a lot, you know?

762
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,360
- Thank you for the compliment. - So...

763
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,840
So I made up my mind.

764
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,289
From now on,

765
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,119
our relationship...

766
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,360
has upgraded to friendship.

767
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,159
What does that mean?

768
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,079
It means we're friends from now on.

769
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
It's hard to find a friend you can trust.

770
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,769
It's so rare.

771
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:08,840
So?

772
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:11,199
So there are some things that we should keep between us.

773
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,679
You don't need to tell anyone.

774
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,000
No problem.

775
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,840
But...

776
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:21,329
if you go on a rescue mission...

777
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,840
or do something...

778
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,719
that could harm one's safety,

779
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,880
I still have to report to Mr. Hou.

780
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,679
I think...

781
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,360
it depends on the situation.

782
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,679
No, that's not true.

783
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,000
It's specified in the contract.

784
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,809
I am obligated to report to Party A...

785
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,880
about the whereabouts of the person I'm protecting.

786
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,719
You are a great person,

787
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,440
but nobody's perfect.

788
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,159
Why can't you empathize with me?

789
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,519
I think volunteering for the rescue...

790
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,920
is a good thing.

791
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,960
But I've never seen anyone...

792
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,000
who doesn't know how to protect themselves like you.

793
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,679
Can you tell me why?

794
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
I can't.

795
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,519
Drink more coffee. Drink something strong.

796
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Xiao Bao.

797
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,960
Don't be nervous.

798
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,199
Hello.

799
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,360
Mr. Hou.

800
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,809
Hello, Mr. Hou.

801
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,039
Hello, Mr. Ma.

802
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,679
- It's been a while, Han. - Long time no see, Mr. Hou.

803
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,880
Please have a seat.

804
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,400
Have a seat.

805
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm sorry.

806
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,599
Mr. Hou, the last time we met,

807
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:13,039
I handed out my business card to you at a forum.

808
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,679
I'm surprised you remember me.

809
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,440
Mr. Hou cherishes talented people.

810
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:19,440
He has never forgotten you.

811
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,719
Thank you, Mr. Hou.

812
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Have some tea.

813
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,400
Mr. Hou, I'm really sorry.

814
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,440
I'm going to tender my design...

815
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,480
and compete with your company.
