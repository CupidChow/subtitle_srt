00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
Hello, Ying Nan.

5
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,239
Dinner tonight is canceled.

6
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,000
A pregnant woman fell down at the supermarket.

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,599
I'm taking her to Number Three Hospital now.

8
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,879
How could you bump into a pregnant woman?

9
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,879
Hurry there.

10
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Hello, Mom.

11
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,370
Shi Yi, how are you doing?

12
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,479
Where are you?

13
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,159
I'm not doing much. What is it?

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,039
I don't know what happened to your dad.

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,599
He knocked over a pregnant woman.

16
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,039
He's at Number Three Hospital now.

17
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,919
I'm worried her family will beat up your dad...

18
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,159
when they get to the hospital.

19
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,360
Come with me.

20
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,599
All right. I'll be right there. I'm hanging up.

21
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,439
Where are you going?

22
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,960
Where are you going?

23
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,479
I'm going to Number Three Hospital.

24
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,960
You're not going anywhere. Do you hear me?

25
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,360
Why am I not allowed to go anywhere?

26
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,680
I have to go home and get changed.

27
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
You can go home.

28
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,319
We'll observe your condition.

29
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,199
Are you her guardian?

30
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,719
No.

31
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,919
Hurry up and call your family.

32
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
Look how big your tummy is now.

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,039
You need someone to take care of you.

34
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,639
I've already informed her husband.

35
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,000
Is it serious, doctor?

36
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,840
No. We'll observe your condition first.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,199
Then you can be discharged.

38
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,439
Why do you always make me worry?

39
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,719
It wasn't easy to have you.

40
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,400
If anything happens to you,

41
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,360
how am I going to explain it to your dad?

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
Don't say anything.

43
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,520
The baby will hear you.

44
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,759
You have to maintain a positive mindset right now.

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,399
Babies have strong vitality.

46
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,610
You have to believe in them.

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,879
Sir.

48
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Thank you.

49
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,170
It's nothing.

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,639
About that day...

51
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,839
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,079
Don't talk about that anymore.

53
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,199
Your matters with Shi Yi are in the past now.

54
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,050
Forget about it.

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,839
Your just dad quit drinking.

56
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,079
We didn't even get peace and quiet for a few days...

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,519
and now this is happening.

58
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,610
Gosh.

59
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,170
He's hopeless!

60
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,959
Mom, we don't know what happened yet.

61
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,959
Let's not resent Dad yet.

62
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,879
He still can't knock down a pregnant woman.

63
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,319
Excuse me, where is the observation room?

64
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,610
Turn left up ahead.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,199
- Thank you. - Thank you.

66
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,050
It's okay now.

67
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,240
Xue Mei.

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,319
Xue Mei, are you all right?

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,730
- Xue Mei, are you okay? - Honey.

70
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,730
Are you okay?

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,079
Why are you here?

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,959
- No, I... - Did you knock her down?

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
No, she...

74
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,959
- Da Peng. - You're taking revenge on us.

75
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,079
This is absolutely revenge!

76
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,639
- Honey. - You don't know the situation.

77
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,759
She's pregnant.

78
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,360
If you have a problem, take it out on me.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,519
It wasn't him.

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,480
I bumped into something myself.

81
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,120
He brought me to the hospital out of kindness.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,759
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,160
It's fine.

84
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,639
As long as they're both safe.

85
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,079
My gosh.

86
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,759
What exactly happened?

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,680
- You... - Zhu Da Peng?

88
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,839
Why are you here?

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
- Did you knock her over? - No, Ms. Zhang.

90
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,519
- How could you think that too? - Ms. Zhang.

91
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,879
He didn't do it.

92
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,160
He brought me to the hospital.

93
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
Are you okay?

94
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm fine.

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Thank you.

96
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,319
That scared me.

97
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,480
- It was a false alarm. - Lie down.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,040
Why didn't you make things clear on the phone?

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,160
How could you...

100
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,040
- What is this? - Did you let me talk?

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,680
You hung up before I could finish.

102
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,439
- You... - Well, you should've said so.

103
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,600
That's enough. Stop arguing.

104
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
We're in a hospital. Let her rest.

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,120
If there's nothing else,

106
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,519
we'll get going.

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,079
Get some rest.

108
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,879
Da Peng.

109
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,759
Take care of your wife.

110
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,480
Now that you're married, your wife is your family.

111
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
I did well this time, didn't I?

112
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,519
I guess you're considered a hero this time.

113
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,920
- Don't get cocky. Keep it up. - Okay.

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,079
Did you hear that? Listen to my mom.

115
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,160
I've always had that chivalrous spirit.

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,279
- Keep bluffing. - Mr. Wu, Ms. Zhang.

117
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,519
Shi Yi.

118
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Thank you.

120
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,639
All right.

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,199
Go back to your wife.

122
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,399
Thank you.

123
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
- Go back. - Go on.

124
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,279
Come on.

125
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,079
It's just that there's love across the miles I've flown

126
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,920
- This step is so high. - Look at how happy Dad is.

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,959
Be careful.

128
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,279
Here.

129
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,759
Have a seat.

130
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm going to wash the cups.

131
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,879
- Mom, take a seat and rest. - Okay.

132
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,199
- Do you need my help? - There's no need.

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,920
Let your dad do it.

134
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,679
- Let him show himself off. - That's right.

135
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,919
Dad, it's your phone.

136
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,559
Answer it for me.

137
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,039
Hello.

138
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,399
Is this Mr. Wu Tian Yi's phone?

139
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes, I'm his daughter, Wu Shi Yi.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,879
You can talk to me.

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Shi Yi.

142
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,039
I'm Mr. Zhang from Zhirong Construction.

143
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,039
Mr. Zhang?

144
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,210
What's the matter?

145
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,879
Here's the thing.

146
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,879
Mr. Hou Jue has already made a debt transfer agreement...

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
with your dad's creditor.

148
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,639
Mr. Wu Tian Yi's debts...

149
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,240
will be transferred to Mr. Hou Jue's name.

150
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,559
This...

151
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,039
I'm sorry. Please wait for a moment.

152
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,399
Dad.

153
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,600
Who is it?

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,759
It's Mr. Zhang.

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Can you repeat what you just said?

156
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,519
Sure.

157
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,279
It's like this.

158
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,720
Mr. Hou Jue has already made a debt transfer agreement...

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,360
with your dad's creditor.

160
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,519
Mr. Wu Tian Yi's debts...

161
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,210
will be transferred to Mr. Hou Jue's name.

162
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,759
If your dad has no objections,

163
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,330
I'll go and find him to sign an agreement.

164
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,399
Please give me your address.

165
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,759
Mr. Zhang.

166
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,450
Please wait a moment.

167
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,240
Can we discuss this first and get back to you?

168
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I see.

169
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,759
Okay. Get Shi Yi to call me later.

170
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,039
Okay, thank you.

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,919
Shi Yi, no. We definitely can't do this.

172
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,919
Hou Jue...

173
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,000
This is ridiculous.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,159
Never mind this for now. I'm going to boil some water.

175
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,679
No.

176
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,480
What's going on?

177
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,759
- Do you not know about this? - I don't.

178
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,450
I thought Dad knew.

179
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,330
Gosh, Hou Jue.

180
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,120
He didn't tell me.

181
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,720
Shi Yi.

182
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,480
Why don't I...

183
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
write Hou Jue an IOU?

184
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,679
Is that okay?

185
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,919
No.

186
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,279
Why not?

187
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,840
Doesn't Hou Jue like Shi Yi?

188
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,679
If he's willing to help,

189
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,000
isn't that a good thing?

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,279
How is it a good thing?

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,279
Why didn't you learn a thing from what happened with Lan Qi?

192
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,759
If you accept such a huge favor from him,

193
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,240
Shi Yi won't get to decide her own feelings.

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
What the heck goes on in your brain all day?

195
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,840
Right. Ying Nan, you're right.

196
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
Yes, this...

197
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,120
That's what I think too.

198
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,799
I was just spouting nonsense.

199
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,399
Shi Yi.

200
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,080
Don't worry about the debt.

201
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,519
It's just 860,000 yuan.

202
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,919
I still have two more years.

203
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,200
I'll figure it out.

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,679
It's okay. I'll pay it back slowly.

205
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,799
Come back here.

206
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,039
Get me a piece of paper and a pen.

207
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,200
What are you doing?

208
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,399
Just do as I say.

209
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,679
Why are you talking so much?

210
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,639
(IOU)

211
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,799
Sign it.

212
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,240
An IOU?

213
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,799
"This is to certify that I, Wu Tian Yi, have borrowed..."

214
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,919
"860,000 yuan from Zhang Ying Nan,"

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,879
"to be paid back in five years."

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
Wait, Ying Nan.

217
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,399
- Mom. - This...

218
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,240
Are you helping my dad pay off his debt?

219
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm not helping him. I'm lending him money.

220
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,240
He has to return the money to me.

221
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,120
Dad, is that okay?

222
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,200
How can I do that?

223
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,039
This isn't appropriate.

224
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,960
If I accept such a huge favor from you,

225
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,799
I'll feel even more ashamed to face you from now on.

226
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,919
So you don't want to borrow the money?

227
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,960
Forget it then.

228
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
No, wait.

229
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Wait a minute.

230
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,279
I agree, okay?

231
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,120
Mom.

232
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,919
You're the best mom in the world.

233
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,000
I just feel sorry for you.

234
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,879
I know.

235
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,519
Shi Yi.

236
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,399
You've suffered so much all these years.

237
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,320
Dad, what are you talking about?

238
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Thank you, Mom.

239
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,039
In our hardest times,

240
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,879
we didn't abandon...

241
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,200
nor leave each other.

242
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,840
We've been together this whole time.

243
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Yes.

244
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,879
No one left anyone behind.

245
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,039
Listen up, Wu Tian Yi.

246
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,320
From this moment on,

247
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,399
I'm your creditor.

248
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,240
You must abide by all the promises...

249
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,639
you've made to me.

250
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,639
Otherwise, I'll blacklist you forever.

251
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,279
I promise.

252
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,480
I'll do as you say.

253
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,879
I knew it.

254
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
My wife is dearest to me.

255
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
Who's your wife?

256
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,519
Dad...

257
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,759
Where's the tea?

258
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,759
Hold on. Coming right up.

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,039
Look at how happy he is.

260
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,720
- Sit down and rest. - Okay.

261
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,799
What took you so long?

262
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Didn't you go home? Why are you still here?

263
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,440
I did. I went home to change.

264
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
How did you get in?

265
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
You didn't lock the door.

266
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,840
Why are you looking at me?

267
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,679
What's the use of your door?

268
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
There's nothing in here.

269
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
The bookshelf is empty. There's nothing in the fridge.

270
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,399
I just put some food in here.

271
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,559
All right, it's your lucky day.

272
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,279
I've decided to show you the Hou family's cooking skills...

273
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,159
that have been passed down for generations.

274
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,600
I'll make you a dish.

275
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,759
Hold on.

276
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
What?

277
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

278
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,759
Tell you what?

279
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,759
About the debt transfer.

280
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,879
Did your dad sign it?

281
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,440
Let me explain it to you.

282
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
I can't take the company's money.

283
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,679
I can't borrow money from my dad either.

284
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,399
So I can't pay it all off at once.

285
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,480
I can only...

286
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,279
sign a third-party agreement and slowly pay it off.

287
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,799
My dad didn't agree to it.

288
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,559
Why not?

289
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:39,679
Does he look down on me?

290
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,519
No, it's because...

291
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,440
my mom has promised to pay it off for him.

292
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
Having your mom pay it off...

293
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,759
is more suitable than having me do it.

294
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,720
But thank you anyway.

295
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,879
Thank me for what?

296
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,360
Thank you for everything you did for my dad.

297
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,399
Come on, louder.

298
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,960
Say more. Compliment me.

299
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Thank you.

300
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,240
Is there any wine?

301
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,799
Wine?

302
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,000
I think...

303
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,759
This is your place.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,840
Didn't you say there's nothing in my house?

305
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,320
Didn't you bring groceries or wine?

306
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,840
You want to drink.

307
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
I want to celebrate.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,279
You want to celebrate. That's easy.

309
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,840
I'll take you somewhere with alcohol.

310
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,919
Everything's clear. Don't worry. Get up.

311
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,440
Okay, let's go.

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Charge forward!

313
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,359
Take a right here.

314
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,279
Go three blocks and then, turn left.

315
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,480
Turn right on Hubin Road.

316
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,480
Then, go straight until Huangpi Road and head south.

317
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,799
Take a left at Jianguo Road.

318
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
Go 200m and stop.

319
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,279
- Okay? - Okay.

320
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,839
Come.

321
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,039
I'll take you to relax.

322
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,170
Come.

323
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Hou Jue, you're here.

324
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,960
I've prepared a booth for you. Come this way.

325
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,319
- Let's go. Quick. - Come.

326
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,599
Here's the booth we prepared for you.

327
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,279
- Call me if you need anything. - Okay.

328
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,319
How is it?

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's quite lively.

330
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,410
Do you see that stage over there?

331
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,559
The place where they're dancing.

332
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,519
I see it. Are you going to dance?

333
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,599
Go ahead. I'm not going.

334
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I didn't ask you to dance.

335
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,839
I arranged a special program for you.

336
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,480
Go up there and sing.

337
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,920
I can't sing.

338
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,440
It's all right. I've already arranged everything.

339
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,650
Stop playing. I'm tone-deaf. I can't sing.

340
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,650
I'm not joking.

341
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Good-looking people are all tone-deaf.

342
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,039
- Go. Come on. - I'm not going.

343
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,440
All right, everyone.

344
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,319
Dance time is over!

345
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,279
Please be seated and recharge your energy.

346
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,839
Meanwhile, we have a big surprise for you.

347
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,410
Now, let's welcome...

348
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,119
tonight's special mystery guest.

349
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,319
She is...

350
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,170
Ms. Wu, who has the voice of an angel,

351
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,799
from Table 10.

352
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,480
Okay. She will sing a song for us.

353
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,039
- Please welcome Ms. Wu. - I can't sing.

354
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,559
No, I'll scare everyone with my singing.

355
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,079
- You'll run away. - Go. Hurry up.

356
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,319
- I'm not going. - So many people are watching you.

357
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,000
Hurry up. They're looking at you.

358
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,079
Stop it.

359
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,170
They're causing an uproar.

360
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,960
Over here. Come.

361
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
No.

362
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,890
Don't go!

363
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,839
- I can't sing. - Take it.

364
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,410
- Sing! - Here's the microphone. Take it.

365
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,559
- I really can't sing. - Take it!

366
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,119
- Sing! - You can do it!

367
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,920
- Do it! - Do it!

368
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,519
You can do it!

369
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,480
You can do it!

370
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,599
"Unknown Journey".

371
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,480
- What? - "Unknown Journey"!

372
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,319
The past is in the past

373
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,319
Don't care too much

374
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,799
Even if you still have a lot of grievances

375
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,720
- Unfinished matters will continue - Stop singing.

376
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,559
- Come down. - There's nothing to fear

377
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Come on

378
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,170
Let's go on an unknown journey

379
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,410
Goodness me!

380
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,920
Don't care what anyone says

381
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,440
Make your own choice

382
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,759
Stop singing!

383
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,410
Behind each stubborn decision

384
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,240
There's a voice calling to me

385
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,359
- Get off the stage! - I believe

386
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,279
There's a meaning to the day before yesterday

387
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,960
As long as you always believe

388
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,650
All good things will always be there

389
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,839
What wonderful serendipity

390
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,599
I believe the day after tomorrow will be full of surprises

391
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,440
As long as you're experiencing it with me

392
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,890
I'm so lucky to have met you

393
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm grateful for all the things that are meant to be

394
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,759
I'm sorry, everyone.

395
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,839
I'm so sorry, everyone.

396
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,000
Sorry for making you suffer.

397
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,519
I am indeed tone-deaf.

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,519
I don't know where my pitch ran off to.

399
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,359
I haven't been able to find it.

400
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,559
To be honest,

401
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,480
I've been ashamed about this...

402
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,839
for almost 30 years.

403
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,160
In the past, whenever my friends asked me to go to karaoke,

404
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,519
I would always find excuses not to go.

405
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,559
They thought I was anti-social.

406
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,400
Actually, I was scared.

407
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,119
I was really scared.

408
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,880
I was afraid people would laugh at me.

409
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Today...

410
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,759
Here's some encouragement!

411
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,839
Thank you to Mr. Hou Jue from Table 10...

412
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,839
for giving me this opportunity...

413
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,680
to experience my 30 years' worth of humiliation!

414
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
- Great! - Awesome!

415
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,480
It's not that bad, right?

416
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:31,000
So I've decided to finish this song!

417
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,000
- Great! - She's quite brave.

418
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,400
Don't worry. There's only a little bit left.

419
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
There's just one last verse. Bear with me, everyone.

420
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If you really can't stand it anymore,

421
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,720
cover your ears or go to the bathroom.

422
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,440
But please don't pay the bill and leave.

423
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,759
Otherwise, I'll have really committed a big crime.

424
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,599
Hou Jue!

425
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
To compensate everyone,

426
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,880
shouldn't you treat everyone to a glass of beer?

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
All right?

428
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,799
- Yes! - Okay!

429
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,480
- No problem. - It's on me.

430
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Come on!

431
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,599
Behind each stubborn decision

432
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,359
There's a voice calling to me

433
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,839
I believe

434
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,799
There's a meaning to the day before yesterday

435
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,720
As long as you always believe

436
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,440
All good things will always be there

437
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,000
What wonderful serendipity

438
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,680
I believe the day after tomorrow will be full of surprises

439
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,440
As long as you're experiencing it with me

440
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm so lucky to have met you

441
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm grateful for all the things that are meant to be

442
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,079
The past is in the past

443
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,839
Don't care too much

444
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,319
Even if you still have a lot of grievances

445
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,240
Unfinished matters will continue

446
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,079
There's nothing to fear

447
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Come on

448
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,839
Let's go on an unknown journey

449
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,039
Don't care what anyone...

450
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,119
Hello.

451
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,519
Were you happy today?

452
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,119
I was so happy.

453
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
You're a terrible singer.

454
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,240
What is there to be happy about?

455
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,880
It's good enough as long as I had fun singing.

456
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,000
If I sang as terribly as you,

457
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,279
I would really be embarrassed to sing.

458
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,640
You made me go up there.

459
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,480
I said I didn't want to, but you forced me to sing.

460
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,759
Listen. I haven't sung enough.

461
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
That's enough.

462
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,359
You haven't had enough but I have.

463
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,799
I actually quite admire you.

464
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,079
You run into so much trouble every day...

465
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,599
but you never let life beat you down.

466
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,240
I've never seen you secretly cry alone either.

467
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,400
That's just because you've never seen it.

468
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,680
I've cried a lot.

469
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,799
Is that so?

470
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,880
I thought you'd say...

471
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,319
that you're a strong person who never cries.

472
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,160
Whenever I was exhausted from training...

473
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,599
or lost a competition,

474
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,680
I always cried.

475
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,599
But after crying...

476
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and wiping away my tears,

477
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,720
I still have to get back out there and fight.

478
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,359
You sure are tough.

479
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,960
Thank you for today.

480
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,680
I was really happy.

481
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,519
I was really happy too.

482
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Thank you.

483
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,599
All right, it's getting late. Go to sleep.

484
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:13,319
- Good night. - Good night.

485
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
What's wrong?

486
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,519
I was checking to see if you were paying attention to me.

487
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,559
Okay, let's go to sleep. Good night.

488
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,880
Stop playing and go to sleep, okay?

489
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm hanging up.

490
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Sir.

491
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
Sir.

492
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Do you remember me?

493
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,079
I know.

494
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,119
You're the friend of my brother's boss.

495
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
That's right.

496
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,440
Didn't I pawn a jade pendant here last time?

497
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,599
I want to buy it back now.

498
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,400
The jade pendant isn't with me.

499
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,319
Wait, what do you mean?

500
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,200
I told you I'd definitely come to get it back.

501
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,319
How could you sell it?

502
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,240
Don't get so worked up.

503
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,559
I'm not getting worked up. You can't do this.

504
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,920
Let me finish.

505
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,240
That jade pendant...

506
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,880
is with your friend who came with you last time.

507
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,839
Which friend?

508
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,119
He knew you needed money.

509
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,960
The 100,000 yuan was his too.

510
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,640
He was afraid you wouldn't be able...

511
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,880
to get the jade pendant back,

512
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,039
so he came to me in advance.

513
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,480
He asked me to put on an act with him.

514
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
It looks like we acted pretty well.

515
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,920
You believed it.

516
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,279
Go.

517
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Go to him for your jade pendant.

518
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,519
I already told you.

519
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:31,440
Jades are led by fate.

520
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,319
If it's meant to be yours,

521
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,240
it can never run away.

522
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
All right.

523
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,359
Thank you.

524
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,839
Bye.

525
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,079
It's fate.

526
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,640
Fate.

527
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Give me two beers.

528
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
Are you trying to rebel?

529
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,880
Why are you drinking in broad daylight?

530
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Listen up.

531
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,559
I'm drinking if you're drinking.

532
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,039
I don't believe I can't handle you.

533
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,319
What are you doing?

534
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,440
Do you have to be like this...

535
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,839
because of those rich people?

536
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,960
When they were in trouble,

537
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,160
you took them in.

538
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,440
But now that they're successful,

539
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,799
they don't even care about you.

540
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,359
You know nothing. Give it to me.

541
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,279
- I know. - Give it back.

542
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,279
I won't.

543
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,240
I understand.

544
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,079
Do you think I don't understand?

545
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,799
You're living in a daze every day now.

546
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,119
Do you know what?

547
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,400
I can't stand seeing you get mistreated by others.

548
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,119
I feel bad when I see you get mistreated.

549
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,319
Do you know that? I'm upset!

550
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,319
Dolly.

551
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,519
That Hou Jue...

552
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,240
and that Qian Qian...

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,359
You treated them sincerely,

554
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,720
but did they take you seriously?

555
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,759
I'm telling you.

556
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,640
I want what they don't so bad.

557
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,920
I really want it.

558
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,440
What are you doing?

559
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,759
Listen.

560
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,960
Girls should be more reserved.

561
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,680
You confessed your feelings so messily just like that...

562
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,000
Boss will think you're just drunk and won't take you seriously.

563
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
Isn't it unfair?

564
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
- Yes. - It is, isn't it?

565
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,079
Both of you should just stop talking and it'll be over.

566
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,079
Do you hear me?

567
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,279
And you. Do you hear me?

568
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,359
That's more like it.

569
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,519
What are you guys doing there?

570
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Get to work.

571
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,720
Gosh.

572
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
Hou Jue.

573
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,240
What's with this shabby sock?

574
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,960
There's such a huge hole! Whose is this?

575
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Look.

576
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
It's mine.

577
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,279
Since when did you have such a sock?

578
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,000
I bought it from a street stall back then.

579
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,799
You must have been scammed.

580
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,079
Look at this quality.

581
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,400
It was 10 yuan for several pairs. How can you expect quality?

582
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,079
You can't do any physical work at all...

583
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,519
and you don't know how to do anything.

584
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,319
Yet, you insisted on being independent.

585
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,920
- Don't play such games again. - All right.

586
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,720
Okay. It's so tattered. I'm throwing it away.

587
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,319
Ms. Zhang.

588
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,759
Don't throw it away.

589
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,559
I have an emotional attachment to this sock. I'll keep it.

590
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,680
- It's such a torn sock. What... - Keep it for me.

591
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,039
The rescue team is assembling for an emergency.

592
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,559
I'll follow you.

593
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,599
Boss, where are you going?

594
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,200
I have a rescue mission. Take care of the restaurant.

595
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
But you...

596
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,079
I forgot the gear.

597
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,119
- Hello. - Hello.

598
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,599
I'm from Angel Rescue. Are you the one who called for help?

599
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,559
That's right. My colleague broke her leg.

600
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,799
- Now... - Where is she?

601
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,359
She's on that cliff. Right there.

602
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,599
Give me a hand.

603
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Thank you.

604
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,480
Be careful.

605
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,119
Hang in there.

606
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,289
Hurry up.

607
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,719
Captain.

608
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,199
It's Hai Xing's car.

609
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:07,880
I think this is the spot.

610
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,599
- I'll go and look for them. - Wait.

611
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
What's the rush?

612
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Is this a new piece of equipment?

613
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:16,360
Apart from this,

614
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,920
there's also a titanium stretcher...

615
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,239
and a full-body immobilizer airbag.

616
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,480
They're at least 200,000 yuan.

617
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Who gave them to us?

618
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Qian Xiao Yan.

619
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,719
Who?

620
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,000
Qian Xiao Yan. Why? Do you know her?

621
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
No.

622
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,519
Captain, we found them.

623
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,639
I think it's here.

624
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,199
- Be careful. - Hang in there.

625
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:53,840
- Hang in there. - Quick.

626
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,239
Hang in there.

627
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Hang in there.

628
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,769
- Be careful. - Be careful.

629
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,809
Hello, you can't go.

630
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:10,119
- We're rescuing someone down there. - My friend...

631
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,519
That's my friend.

632
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,880
I think he's hurt.

633
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,119
Can you let me go and take a look?

634
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,119
Hai Xing!

635
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:16,769
Hai Xing!

636
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,329
Stand here for a while.

637
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,079
- I want to help. - Please wait.

638
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,519
My friend is down there.

639
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,960
- Hai Xing! - Don't go!

640
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Hai Xing.

641
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,559
- What happened to your leg? - Why are you here?

642
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,769
I was worried, so I followed you.

643
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:51,000
Come on, I'll help you.

644
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:52,329
Dolly.

645
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,039
Don't come along to my rescue missions anymore.

646
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,039
It's too dangerous.

647
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,920
Here, get in the car.

648
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,199
What's wrong with your car?

649
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,519
Who knows?

650
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,239
Even the car is against me.

651
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,679
Try again.

652
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,159
Try again.

653
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:32,599
What a phony.

654
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,769
Don't say that about my buddy.

655
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,480
You still regard him as your buddy?

656
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,639
I was the one who let him down.

657
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,519
Why?

658
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,719
I scammed his dad's money.

659
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,960
Boss, watch your leg.

660
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,159
Be careful.

661
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:53,639
Be careful.

662
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,519
It's okay.

663
00:39:58,809 --> 00:39:59,960
Do we have to unhook this?

664
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:03,079
- Do you need my help? - There's no need.

665
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:05,329
Be careful.

666
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,039
You're already here. Come inside.

667
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,119
It's okay.

668
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:32,079
Take care of your boss's wound when you get back.

669
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,329
Have a seat.

670
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Come and have a seat.

671
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,920
We have many new dishes. They're delicious.

672
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
I'm sure you haven't tasted them.

673
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,079
It's okay. I have something to do.

674
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:48,480
You guys have worked so hard. You must be tired.

675
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,199
Go up and stay for a bit. Really.

676
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,159
Go up and stay for a bit. Really.

677
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,719
Sit for a bit.

678
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,880
I haven't had Hai Xing Fried Rice in a long time.

679
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,159
Get one to go for me.

680
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,639
Let's go, Hou Jue.

681
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:01,769
Let me...

682
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
turn off the engine.

683
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:04,809
Sure.

684
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,809
Come on, let's go.

685
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,119
Come in and have a seat. Sit anywhere.

686
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,840
Give me one Hai Xing Fried Rice to go.

687
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:25,880
Hai Xing Fried Rice?

688
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
How about this?

689
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,480
We have a new dish, barbecued pork rice.

690
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,639
It's just as good as Hai Xing Fried Rice.

691
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:34,809
Why don't you try it?

692
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
Fine.

693
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
All right.

694
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Wait here.
