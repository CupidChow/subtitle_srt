4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,000
Your colleagues are starting to get suspicious.

5
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,319
Keep going on blind dates.

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,759
It's a robbery! Help! I've been robbed!

7
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,879
Our girl is great.

8
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,530
What are you so happy about?

9
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,039
So many things happened lately, but we knew nothing.

10
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,530
Shi Yi has been like that since young.

11
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,090
She keeps all the problems to herself.

12
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,280
Why are there bad people like that?

13
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,090
How could they frame Shi Yi like that?

14
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,639
The person is so evil.

15
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,719
That's right.

16
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,719
That Hou Jue seemed like an educated man.

17
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,199
How could he be so coldhearted?

18
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,639
One word from the girlfriend and he sent Shi Yi away.

19
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,520
Where is justice?

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,199
Don't worry, ma'am. I've looked for Mr. Hou.

21
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,719
I pressured him a little.

22
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,960
He has to know...

23
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,520
that Shi Yi is not without help.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,840
Moreover, I've already decided.

25
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,759
Even if the police don't solve the case in time,

26
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm still going to take legal action...

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,319
to seek justice for Shi Yi.

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,039
Thank you, Lan Qi.

29
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,599
Don't mention it.

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,479
To be honest, I've always been a bit hesitant...

31
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,159
about her becoming a bodyguard.

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,599
Not only is it risky,

33
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,319
but you also don't get any respect from the client.

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
When there's a problem, the bodyguard is held responsible.

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,800
You have to be willing to die as well as suffer.

36
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,960
Even though the pay is good,

37
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,280
but it's at the expense of your life.

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,479
Why bother?

39
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,759
But it's what Shi Yi loves to do.

40
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,919
If you want her to switch jobs,

41
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,120
she definitely won't agree.

42
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,439
How would we know if we didn't try?

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,199
Lan Qi.

44
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,960
You're well-connected.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
Can you do something about it?

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,840
Help Shi Yi look for a suitable job.

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,759
Yes.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,719
How about this?

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
I think our company's Security Department...

50
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,800
is a good fit for her.

51
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
Based on her experience,

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,479
she can become a manager.

53
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,080
Firstly, the income will not be less than a personal bodyguard.

54
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,039
And more importantly,

55
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,280
it is way less risky.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,319
- That's great. - That's great.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,599
But Mr. Wu, ma'am,

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,439
we can't make the decision.

59
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,519
You have to ask for her opinion.

60
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,360
It's not right for us to impose our intention onto her.

61
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,680
That's true.

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,240
I know. I know you're frustrated.

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,519
But I promise you.

64
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,079
I will submit the design blueprint...

65
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,360
within the contract period, okay?

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,199
As you know, we're short-staffed.

67
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,319
Okay, that's all for now.

68
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,319
Okay, bye.

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,319
Hey, Ms. Qian.

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,879
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

71
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,759
I promise you. I'll be right there.

72
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,199
Don't be mad.

73
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,050
I'm dead meat.

74
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,879
Hurry up and take it out.

75
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,959
- Mr. Hou, I'll take these in. - No.

76
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,560
Wait for me outside.

77
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,480
- Wait for me inside. - Okay.

78
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,319
Qian Qian.

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
I'm really sorry.

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,399
I'm late.

81
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,839
You're late on your first day of class.

82
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,800
Do you really want to learn?

83
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,759
Qian Qian,

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,439
the way you spoke, looking all serious,

85
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,639
was so cool.

86
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,759
Don't joke around.

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,319
Do you want to learn?

88
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,040
Of course I do.

89
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,120
I promise it won't happen again.

90
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,519
Let's get started.

91
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,519
No.

92
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,279
If my team members were late today...

93
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,040
Of course they wouldn't be late.

94
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,920
But let's say they were,

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
they'd receive punishment.

96
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,079
Running for 10,000m.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,439
Running for 10,000m?

98
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,040
You're so ruthless.

99
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,639
I saw a garden outside on my way here.

100
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,560
It's about 1,200m per lap.

101
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,759
You can do eight laps.

102
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,480
What?

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
Go on.

104
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,839
You want me to run?

105
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,160
Did you expect me to run?

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,639
Qian Qian.

107
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,959
No, I mean Ms. Qian.

108
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Listen.

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,160
You didn't tell me about this beforehand.

110
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,439
We didn't set the rules.

111
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,680
I get it now.

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,319
If I had known, I promise.

113
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,600
I would get here early no matter how busy I am.

114
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,399
Also,

115
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,399
I haven't run for years.

116
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,480
And I...

117
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,560
I currently have a lot of ailments.

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,600
It's true. I'm...

119
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,839
Let's discuss this.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We'll decide on a new set of rules, okay?

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,839
You have ailments, do you?

122
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,839
Yes.

123
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,000
You'll feel better after running and sweating.

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm the instructor.

125
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,000
I call the shots.

126
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,879
Ms. Qian.

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Well...

128
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,639
How about this?

129
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
I'll pay for it.

130
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,319
One yuan per meter.

131
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Mr. Hou.

132
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,600
Not everything can be bought with money.

133
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,519
I guess it's too low.

134
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,079
How about two yuan per meter?

135
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,879
I'll buy it, okay?

136
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,879
I'll count to three. If you don't run, I'm leaving.

137
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,759
- One. - Fine.

138
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,560
I will run.

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,800
Right.

140
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,040
This is a gift for you.

141
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,079
I hope you like it.

142
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,360
Run. Off you go!

143
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,210
This is the hotel of one of our employees.

144
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,480
If you like the food here,

145
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,360
you're welcome any time.

146
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
It's on me.

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
You're too kind.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,960
Thank you, Lan Qi.

149
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,039
Come over for dinner sometime.

150
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,840
- I'll cook for you. - All right.

151
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,279
What about you, Mr. Wu?

152
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,559
I can give you a ride.

153
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,450
It's okay. You must be busy.

154
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,639
I can go on my own. It's no trouble.

155
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,360
- Yes, let him go on his own. - All right.

156
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,759
See you, Mr. Wu, ma'am.

157
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,799
- Bye. - Bye.

158
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,159
Hold on. I'm choking.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,399
I haven't had an appetite like this in years.

160
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,960
Everything tastes good.

161
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,759
Actually, going for a run is good.

162
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,090
It's a mission from Ms. Qian's mission.

163
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,799
I will do it to my best ability.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,090
Did you see it?

165
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,159
After running today,

166
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,679
my golf skills were better than usual.

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,360
Looks like running...

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
is pretty good.

169
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,240
Are you planning to be late again?

170
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,210
What's the matter? Are you addicted to running?

171
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,240
That's right.

172
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,759
The point is, I tasted the reward for being a latecomer.

173
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,679
Running, sweating.

174
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,039
And I get to have a meal with Ms. Qian.

175
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,960
And do you know...

176
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,090
what the most important thing is?

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
I made you angry.

178
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,759
When you're angry,

179
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,210
the way your nostrils puff up,

180
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,639
I don't know why, but it makes me gleeful.

181
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,330
If you're late again,

182
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,639
the punishment might not be running.

183
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,919
I have plenty of ways to punish you.

184
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,159
What do you want?

185
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,519
I can't tell you now.

186
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,559
We'll decide when you're late.

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,080
Fine, you win.

188
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,240
You little brat.

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,879
I'm telling you.

190
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm busy with work.

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,799
I tend to lose track of time when I'm working.

192
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,879
Next time,

193
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,080
could you remind me earlier?

194
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,120
All right?

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,080
A person...

196
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,440
only tends to forget things...

197
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,840
that they don't care about.

198
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,120
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

199
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
I'll remember that.

200
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,639
Do you like the gift I gave you?

201
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,159
I totally forgot about it.

202
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
It's a good mask.

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
All my friends use it.

204
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
I'll keep it.

205
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Sure.

206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,159
I really like this bag.

207
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,919
But it's too much.

208
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,279
I can't accept it.

209
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,120
- But... - Okay.

210
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,759
It's almost time.

211
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,919
Thank you for the mask. Bye.

212
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,360
Qian...

213
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,000
Come in.

214
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,639
Dad.

215
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,600
I made coffee for you to try.

216
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
What are you doing?

217
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
It's nothing. I just wanted you to try my handiwork.

218
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,159
I guess the sun will rise from the west.

219
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
How is it?

220
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,399
Smooth.

221
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,120
It's good.

222
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,519
My dad knows what he's doing.

223
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,039
When I was younger,

224
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,000
every time I was rushing to complete a design,

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
night and day all melded together.

226
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,240
I drank coffee like no tomorrow.

227
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,240
But I can't anymore. I'm old now.

228
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,720
I get heart palpitations if I drink coffee.

229
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,960
It has been hard on you.

230
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,480
Out with it.

231
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,799
What is it you want from me?

232
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,960
It's nothing. It's really nothing.

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,759
Let Wu Shi Yi come back.

234
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,799
It's not that Zhou Quan is bad.

235
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,559
He's very good at his job.

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,080
However, Shi Yi got fired...

237
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
because she was framed.

238
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,120
It's the right thing to do.

239
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Let's at least complete the contract period.

240
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Am I right?

241
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,480
In order to let a bodyguard fulfill her contract period,

242
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,039
you've learned to talk nicely to your dad?

243
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
That's surprising to me.

244
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,000
Isn't that normal?

245
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,000
All right.

246
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,960
Let me think about it, okay?

247
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,600
Think about it.

248
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,799
Okay.

249
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,039
Think about it.

250
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,279
Cut down on the coffee.

251
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,919
Caffeine keeps you up at night.

252
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,759
I'll close the door for you.

253
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Hello, Mr. Hou.

254
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,639
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

255
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,039
I'm Zhi Rong.

256
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,600
I'd like to ask you something.

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,039
That female bodyguard, Wu Shi Yi.

258
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,120
How's her relationship with Hou Jue?

259
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,440
They're okay.

260
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,679
They don't fight or anything.

261
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,360
Ms. Zhang, please don't misunderstand.

262
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,080
I'll be honest with you.

263
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,000
About that girl, Fang Lu,

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,639
I'm sure you know.

265
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm worried that there could be problems...

266
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,799
in the way Hou Jue handles his love affairs.

267
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,879
He came to see me several times...

268
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,440
asking me to let Shi Yi come back.

269
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
So I...

270
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,799
I'm a little worried.

271
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,559
You don't need to worry about that.

272
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,559
Shi Yi is a very honest girl.

273
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,879
Anyway, I think she was very strict with Hou Jue.

274
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,279
She knows when to interfere and step back.

275
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,080
She says what needs to be said.

276
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,080
I've been watching.

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
After Shi Yi joined us,

278
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,240
Hou Jue has become a completely different person.

279
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,799
He used to be nonchalant about everything.

280
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,279
But he's better now.

281
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
He puts more effort into his work.

282
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,440
So don't worry.

283
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,399
Okay, I got it.

284
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,799
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

285
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,919
Please don't tell Hou Jue that I called you.

286
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,919
I worry that if he finds out,

287
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,039
he'll come and pick a fight with me.

288
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
I got it. I won't tell him.

289
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Okay, Ms. Zhang.

290
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,919
Thank you.

291
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,919
Bye.

292
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Hello, Hou Jue.

293
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,759
Your dad just called.

294
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,240
He asked me about you.

295
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,960
So I told him what I was supposed to.

296
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,039
I didn't say what I shouldn't have.

297
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,200
Don't worry.

298
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,410
Thank you.

299
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Why are you thanking me?

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,170
I didn't lie for you.

301
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,650
Okay.

302
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,519
Okay, I'm hanging up.

303
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,170
Those two, father and son. Gosh.

304
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,839
Ms. Qian.

305
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,119
Ms. Qian, I've got a job.

306
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,410
Congratulations, Comrade Wu Shi Yi.

307
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,410
Thank you.

308
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,079
I can finally come home and sleep comfortably on my bed.

309
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,119
What do you mean?

310
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,279
You think I'm troublesome?

311
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,759
Do you think I'm mooching off of you?

312
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,000
The way you're sticking to me,

313
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,799
I can't even get a boyfriend.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,039
Don't forget.

315
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,960
I have a vote of veto.

316
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,410
Yes, madam.

317
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,519
Who's your client?

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,359
The same Hou Jue.

319
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,359
He spoke to Mr. Zhao...

320
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,200
and asked me to go back and work for him.

321
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,650
That's good.

322
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,000
You're smiling to yourself again.

323
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,079
Something is up.

324
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
Something is going on.

325
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,039
Tell me. Who is it?

326
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,119
Do I know him?

327
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:37,480
No, you don't.

328
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,519
Who is it then?

329
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,519
The one I met at the golf course.

330
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,039
Is he the type you like?

331
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,440
The kind that makes your heart flutter at first sight?

332
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,410
Actually,

333
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,240
it's better than I thought.

334
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,680
I can see that you're tempted.

335
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
Is there a photo on the phone? Let me see. Come on.

336
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,480
No.

337
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,559
- Let me see. - Attention!

338
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,799
Yes.

339
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,079
Let me see.

340
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,759
Not yet.

341
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm just at the sussing out phase.

342
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,759
How boring.

343
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,680
So what do you feel?

344
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,799
I think...

345
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,000
when I'm with him,

346
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,720
I can be willful,

347
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,279
I can nag,

348
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,079
or throw tantrums.

349
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,480
When I'm with him,

350
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,079
I really feel like I can be a woman.

351
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,650
Do you get it?

352
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,799
So you found the perfect man.

353
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,079
It's not exactly perfect.

354
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
He's a little old.

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
How much older?

356
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,839
I don't think age is an issue.

357
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,200
He's an outstanding man, so I'm willing to ignore the age.

358
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,799
Five years?

359
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Eight?

360
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,839
Ten?

361
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,079
Fifteen?

362
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,680
Eighteen?

363
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,240
More? Twenty years older?

364
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,559
He's 92 years old?

365
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,410
What? It's 29.

366
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,279
- Where did you see the 92? - No, that's...

367
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,279
You scared me. I thought you found a 92-year-old.

368
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
But 29 isn't that small.

369
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm worried about that too.

370
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,759
But you know what?

371
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,240
When I'm with him,

372
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,200
I never feel like...

373
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,119
there is such a big age difference.

374
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,890
Is he single?

375
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,960
A widower with a son.

376
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,240
How old is the son?

377
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,839
I don't know. I didn't ask.

378
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,359
How is he to you?

379
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,079
To me...

380
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,519
I'm a little confused too.

381
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,759
It's like...

382
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,410
I think...

383
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,519
he likes me.

384
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,200
But I don't know whether his feelings for me...

385
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
are the lovers' kind...

386
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
or just the friends' kind.

387
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,319
Or maybe he sees me as a junior.

388
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,720
Do you understand?

389
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
I don't.

390
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,359
I haven't even met him. I...

391
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,599
Look at you, all pleased.

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,559
So you've fallen for him.

393
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,559
The age difference is kind of big,

394
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,079
but being middle-aged isn't so bad.

395
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,559
They're more mature and thoughtful, right?

396
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,519
Not like Hou Jue.

397
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,359
He's just like a child.

398
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,079
Whoever is in a relationship with him,

399
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,720
being his girlfriend...

400
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,960
would be like being his mom.

401
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,680
His mom?

402
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
I know, right?

403
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,519
His mom...

404
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,000
Hou Jue.

405
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,799
Is it ready? The company car is on its way.

406
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,759
Just a minute.

407
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,680
All right. Do you need help?

408
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,400
No, I'm coming.

409
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Try one.

410
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,240
Energy cubes.

411
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,079
If you didn't eat when you're out on a mission,

412
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,599
take one piece and it will fill you up.

413
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,720
It's a secret recipe.

414
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,720
- Not bad. - Right?

415
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,880
But it's my first time having a guy cook for me.

416
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,559
Stop looking at me so full of lust.

417
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,319
It's my first time making it for a man too.

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,119
Shi Yi is here.

419
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,119
Take it.

420
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,039
Hello, Hou Jue. I'm Wu Shi Yi.

421
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,759
I am replacing Zhou Quan as your personal escort.

422
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,319
The company car is waiting.

423
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,720
I'll get going then.

424
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Mr. Hou Jue.

425
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
Thank you for your support.

426
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,680
No need to be so formal. We're friends from now on.

427
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,119
All right.

428
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,400
Take care.

429
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,440
Okay.

430
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,039
Have a safe trip.

431
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,920
Thank you.

432
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,759
Come in.

433
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
Welcome, my new friend.

434
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Hey...

435
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,920
My luggage. Stop messing around.

436
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,960
You...

437
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,119
Are you done?

438
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,279
My luggage.

439
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,279
Luggage.

440
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,400
Here.

441
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
So...

442
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,480
Where's Ms. Zhang?

443
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,039
Ms. Zhang is off today.

444
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,240
She went to see her friend.

445
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,079
You haven't eaten, have you?

446
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,480
I'll order something.

447
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,640
Don't order food.

448
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,599
I'll cook today.

449
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,880
I'll make you something delicious.

450
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Go and unpack your things.

451
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,680
Sit for a few hours.

452
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,880
I'll be done.

453
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,039
Can you manage?

454
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,039
Don't worry.

455
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,119
I'm looking forward to eating.

456
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,240
You're so good with a knife.

457
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,400
When did you learn it?

458
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,799
You must be here to learn in secret.

459
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,079
Your cooking skills seemed to have improved.

460
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,359
Did you get possessed by Snow White?

461
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,119
You seem like a different person.

462
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,640
Actually,

463
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,119
I'm a very deep,

464
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,079
intellectual,

465
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,160
and multifaceted man.

466
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,559
That's why I can't let you see right through me.

467
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,880
I don't intend to.

468
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,839
What if the insides are filled with parasites crawling around?

469
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,000
That would spoil my appetite.

470
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,359
My body only contains a noble soul...

471
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,839
and pure flesh.

472
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
Don't talk to me.

473
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
Watch the knife.

474
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,279
You'll cut yourself.

475
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,720
Why are you so concerned about me today?

476
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,839
Well, if you get hurt, it's on me.

477
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,359
It means I didn't do my job, okay?

478
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,359
It's not fair.

479
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,119
Don't worry. I'll make sure you won't get framed again.

480
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,000
Fine, I believe you.

481
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,319
I've never had a client cook for me before.

482
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,119
To be precise,

483
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,880
except for my parents,

484
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
no one has ever cooked for me before.

485
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,240
Really?

486
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,200
This meal...

487
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,799
First of all, it's to welcome you.

488
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,519
Secondly, it contains my thanks.

489
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,759
It contains my gratitude.

490
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,559
There are a lot of words in it.

491
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,400
You'll know when you taste it.

492
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,680
Okay, I...

493
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,519
I shouldn't just watch you.

494
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,359
Can I do anything to help?

495
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
Should I wash the vegetables?

496
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,799
Sure.

497
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,039
Which one?

498
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,799
This?

499
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,880
Okay.

500
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,880
Hold on.

501
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,759
I'll tie an apron for you.

502
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,960
- Don't get your clothes dirty. - No need.

503
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,039
Here.

504
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
It's okay.

505
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Don't you think the scene...

506
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,039
is heartwarming?

507
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,519
It's like we are...

508
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,799
an old married couple.

509
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,599
I'll do it. Come on.

510
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,599
I'm almost done.

511
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,680
I'll do it myself.

512
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,799
You do your stuff.

513
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
I'll tie it again for you.

514
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,359
What are you doing? Why tie it again?

515
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,960
I got it. Don't move.

516
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,319
Stop it.

517
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,200
Loneliness is an illness.

518
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,920
(Loneliness is an illness.)

519
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,440
It's an ancestral antidote...

520
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,880
to treat loneliness.

521
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,680
Look at this light.

522
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,640
This music...

523
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,400
really sets the mood.

524
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,599
Shouldn't we have a drink?

525
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,680
You can drink. Here.

526
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,119
I mean drink together. What's the point of drinking myself?

527
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,680
I told you. I can't drink when I'm working.

528
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,160
Today, let's not talk about work.

529
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Let's relax today.

530
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,319
To this quiet night.

531
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,400
Are you sure...

532
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,680
that no matter what happens,

533
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,680
you won't walk out that door?

534
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,799
I promise I won't leave.

535
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,039
If I have to leave, I'll leave through the window.

536
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,079
All right?

537
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,160
You'll fall to your death.

538
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
Come on.

539
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,160
Okay, since I'm feeling good today.

540
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,359
Today,

541
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,480
this drink together with all these dishes...

542
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,119
are to welcome you.

543
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,799
Secondly, they are to thank you...

544
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,240
for taking care of me thus far.

545
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,799
Also,

546
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,000
for everything I put you through,

547
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,240
I'll make an exception.

549
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,720
Just this once. Don't make it a habit.

550
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,720
Thank you as well.

551
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,359
Two days ago, at the training center,

552
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,720
you worried that I'd be beaten to death,

553
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,759
so you tried to protect me.

554
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,759
I could see that.

555
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,119
Though it was a bit of a mess,

556
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,359
I'm still quite touched.

557
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,039
You could tell?

558
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,480
I'm glad you noticed.

559
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,079
I feel bad for you, you know?

560
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,720
It's unfair that you got beaten up.

561
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Watching you getting beat up...

562
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,799
and knowing how awful you must have felt...

563
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,960
made me even more upset.

564
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,799
So I can't let that happen again.

565
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,079
I'm going to seek justice for you.

566
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,759
Although I'm no match for your instructor,

567
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,680
I can make them feel guilty, right?

568
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,359
That's your only option. Here.

569
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,240
There's something...

570
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,400
I didn't want to tell you before.

571
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,319
I don't like to talk that much.

572
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,960
But today,

573
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,640
since you agreed to drink with me,

574
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,480
I'll be frank with you...

575
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,279
about my impression of you.

576
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,319
I didn't know much about you.

577
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,599
But through our interactions...

578
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,960
and getting to spend more time with you,

579
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,279
I gradually understood.

580
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,359
Actually, I feel sorry for you sometimes.

581
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,440
I think...

582
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,519
you've come a long way.

583
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,480
I know you grew up...

584
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,079
Your parents got divorced when you were very young.

585
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,039
You then joined the cadet school.

586
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
You trained every day.

587
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,480
While others studied, you trained.

588
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,880
While others were shopping, you were training.

589
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,559
While others went on dates,

590
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,680
you still trained.

591
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,400
After all these years of training,

592
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,400
you got a job...

593
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,359
as well as a boyfriend.

594
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,839
You were in an unreliable relationship.

595
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,599
You don't talk about it,

596
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,279
but I know it was a huge blow to you.

597
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,319
From the first time I saw you on the street, chasing him,

598
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,079
to seeing how you reacted...

599
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,039
and handled things later,

600
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,279
you might have wrapped yourself up well to protect yourself,

601
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,319
but from the look in your eyes,

602
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,000
from your demeanor,

603
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,119
I saw traces of sadness, sorrow.

604
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,960
Or perhaps...

605
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,839
annoyance towards yourself.

606
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,240
I noticed it.

607
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,359
Sometimes,

608
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,079
I really feel sorry.

609
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,319
Why did you and I...

610
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,240
Although we bicker...

611
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,119
and we get into trouble,

612
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,680
but from the bottom of my heart,

613
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,119
I still feel bad for you.

614
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,359
It's because...

615
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,799
I think you deserve to be fussed over.

616
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,359
It's because I believe...

617
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,920
that you will be happy.

618
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,920
Why? It's because you've been through a lot.

619
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,039
But I think the earlier ups and downs...

620
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,599
and conflicts are not necessarily a bad thing.

621
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,359
Everything you've been through in your life...

622
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:22,480
will be your asset for the future.

623
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,559
In the future,

624
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,960
they become your strength.

625
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,839
They make you stronger and wiser.

626
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,079
But I still...

627
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:37,079
can't help but feel bad for you.

628
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,680
I feel a little emotional.

629
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,440
A girl like you...

630
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,400
Wu Shi Yi, a girl like you...

631
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,200
will be happy for sure.

632
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,079
Because if you can't be happy,

633
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,400
no one will.

634
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,839
By the way,

635
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,799
I think you're especially happy to have met me.

636
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Don't you think so?

637
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,720
The last sentence is more important, right?

638
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,839
For your happiness.

639
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,799
I wish you happiness.

640
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,440
Do you feel happy?

641
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,719
Come on.

642
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,360
Where are you taking me?

643
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,769
It's pitch black.

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,559
It's just around the corner. Hurry up.

645
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,679
You're not trying to sell me, are you?

646
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,000
This place is like a fairy tale.

647
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,519
Have you been here before?

648
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,329
I remember taking Hou Jue...

649
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,840
to these places when he was a boy.

650
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Come on.

651
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,039
- Let's go. - Where to?

652
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,199
Go and play.

653
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,360
I'm not going.

654
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,809
This is for young people.

655
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,559
I can't. Go and have fun.

656
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,289
I'll wait outside. Go.

657
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,039
I forgot. You're old.

658
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,719
An old man can't be playing, right?

659
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,769
What do you mean?

660
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,360
Are you saying I'm old?

661
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:59,329
I'll show you.

662
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:00,400
I'm telling you.

663
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,599
Old men won't lose to the youngsters.

664
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,199
Don't be rash.

665
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,719
Recklessness is deadly.

666
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,289
That's the exit. The exit.

667
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:11,960
Over there. The entry is that way.

668
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,329
Do you have money?

669
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,329
Yes.

670
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:20,880
What is this?

671
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,360
You're underestimating me.

672
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,289
Listen, if I designed this merry-go-round,

673
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,239
it would be at least double the speed.

674
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,079
According to your design plan,

675
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,880
it would be like a crazy merry-go-round.

676
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,639
You know what?

677
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,480
We didn't have many fun things growing up.

678
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,599
We just played...

679
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,400
with little glass beads.

680
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,679
That's what we played with.

681
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,769
Or we went to a sandbox and spinning seats.

682
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,000
Spinning seats at the sandbox.

683
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,809
I could play for the whole day.

684
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,840
You young lads are a lucky bunch.

685
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,039
I loved riding on the merry-go-round when I was young.

686
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:57,360
But I stopped when I entered middle school.

687
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,239
At that time, I hung out with my friends.

688
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,519
We would do whatever that was thrilling...

689
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,000
or exciting.

690
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,239
But now,

691
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,199
I still prefer riding the merry-go-round.

692
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,289
I love that it goes slow.

693
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Slow?

694
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,809
If you said I like to take it slow at my age,

695
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:13,920
that'd be understandable.

696
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,679
Why do you like to take things slow?

697
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,960
What's the saying?

698
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,880
"Walk slowly..."

699
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,519
"so the soul can keep up."

700
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,199
I think that's what it means.

701
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:25,769
It makes sense.

702
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,920
You should age slower as well.

703
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,000
I...

704
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,079
Look at me.

705
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,239
I tend to overthink matters.

706
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,289
I tire myself out that way.

707
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:43,639
I've long forgotten...

708
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,920
how simplicity could be so satisfying.

709
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
That's right.

710
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,329
So according to you,

711
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,769
I shouldn't be the doctor to treat your loneliness.

712
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,679
I should be your medicine.

713
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,480
Yes, the cure-all medicine.

714
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,639
Go!

715
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,119
Go!

716
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,719
It's raining.

717
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,159
How is it?

718
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,639
The old man stood up to the challenge, right?

719
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,809
Yes.

720
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,679
Two grilled tripes, please.

721
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,719
All right.

722
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,239
- How much is it? - Ten yuan.

723
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,360
Ten yuan.

724
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,329
I should pay for this because you treated my ailment.

725
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:39,679
Getting treated to a meal is part of the antidote.

726
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,769
I'd be a freeloader.

727
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,679
Sir, I've paid the bill.

728
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,000
Bring me two more soft drinks.

729
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,360
- Sure. - How much is it?

730
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:47,769
Twenty yuan.

731
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,809
- Okay, it's paid. - Okay, thank you.

732
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:51,840
Here you go.

733
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
- Thank you. - Thank you.

734
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,920
Come on.

735
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,159
Bottoms up.

736
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,239
Wait a minute!

737
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,329
Really?

738
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,079
Why are you like this after drinking?

739
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,360
It's true.

740
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,639
Don't drink too much.

741
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I'm afraid...

742
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
Where's the wine?

743
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,719
Stop drinking.

744
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,480
- Where's the wine? - Let's pour our hearts out.

745
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,329
- Why are you hiding it? - Let's talk, okay?

746
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,769
Let's talk while we drink.

747
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,880
I think you should stop drinking.

748
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,480
Why shouldn't I?

749
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
- Bottoms up. - Gosh.

750
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,809
Go for it!

751
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:42,880
You can talk to me directly.

752
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,719
Let me know if you have any thoughts about me.

753
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,199
But can you stop giving me wine?

754
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,199
All right?

755
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
You give up?

756
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,079
I give up.

757
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,719
All right.

758
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,400
What I think of you...

759
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,360
You always make others worry.

760
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,559
How so?

761
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:07,360
I've never met a client like you before.

762
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,329
But you have a lot of good qualities too.

763
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,639
Sometimes,

764
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,920
you have this cute...

765
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,079
and adorable side.

766
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,480
That's right.

767
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,599
You're kind.

768
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,079
You can't stand seeing people suffer.

769
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,639
Including me.

770
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:40,559
And...

771
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,440
That...

772
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,599
- Fang Lu. - Fang Lu.

773
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:50,239
And that...

774
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:52,809
Huang Yue.

775
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:53,920
Yes, Huang Yue.

776
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
I can't remember her name because I only met her a few times.

777
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,159
You have a lot of good qualities.

778
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,239
What about other aspects?

779
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,079
For example, this...

780
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:07,809
Don't you have any comments?

781
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,039
This?

782
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,239
Your looks?

783
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,679
To be honest, being born with a face like yours...

784
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,769
is quite sad.

785
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,000
It's true.

786
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,199
How a man looks doesn't really matter.

787
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,679
Of course being handsome is good.

788
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,119
Handsome is good.

789
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,039
But most importantly,

790
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,809
you need to have an interesting soul.

791
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,769
Do I have it?

792
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,639
Congratulations.

793
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:46,769
You do.

794
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,239
I do? I do.

795
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,360
My soul can't get any more interesting.

796
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:57,920
I'm too interesting.

797
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Not only am I good-looking, but I also have an interesting soul.

798
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,679
This kind of man...

799
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:02,880
is top quality!
