4
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,079
Sir, your package is here.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,159
It's finally here.

6
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,840
It would be too late if it came any later.

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
Good things take time.

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,879
Look at this packaging. There's definitely no problem.

9
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Look.

10
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,920
"We'll compensate you with triple the money if it's fake."

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,959
Don't worry.

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Good things are worth waiting for.

13
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,959
- It's wrapped so tightly. - It is.

14
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,159
There's still another layer.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
You can just take it out directly.

16
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,719
Not bad.

17
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,090
Why are there so many?

18
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,039
I only paid for one though.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
We lucked out. He must have made a mistake.

20
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
This is a good thing.

21
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,159
No.

22
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,919
Didn't it say they'd compensate us with triple the amount if it's fake?

23
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,639
This is fake and this is triple the amount.

24
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,639
My gosh. I've been fooled.

25
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,439
Now you can't complain.

26
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,560
You can't trust the Internet.

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,439
You bought a pig in a poke. I told you cheap stuff isn't good.

28
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,599
No, this...

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,400
What a joke. This is so fake.

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
Actually, let me see.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,479
- Can you tell? - Can't you tell?

32
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,479
I can't tell.

33
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,240
- It's okay. - I guess you can't really tell.

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,280
Isn't that right?

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
This was made quite well.

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,039
It's bright. Look at the glare. Look.

37
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,039
It's quite shiny.

38
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,759
Then let's use this for now.

39
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,919
Let's use it for now.

40
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,960
She'd better hurry and drop the case.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,560
- That's right. - Look at how the other ones are.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,280
Pick the best one. Hurry.

43
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,319
Let me look at them one at a time.

44
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll tell Fang Lu that we found the necklace first.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
I'll give you this one.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,479
I'll take the other three.

47
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,919
What are you doing?

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I...

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Are you giving them to Qian Qian?

50
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,400
That's right. They're necklaces.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,919
They're quite nice, so I'll give one to her.

52
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,159
I'll give the other two to Mr. Tian.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
He can give them to his wife.

54
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,680
They'll get pricked.

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
The quality is so bad.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
They're quite good.

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Is this one mine?

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
That's yours.

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,199
Find me a better packaging.

60
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,319
How could l carry it in a plastic bag?

61
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,240
Well...

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Okay.

63
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,879
Come to Damon's Bar. I want to see you.

64
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,879
Okay, Hou Jue.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,280
I'll be right there.

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Hou Jue.

67
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,399
Lu Lu, sit.

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,879
Hello. What would you like to order?

69
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,879
A glass of orange juice will do.

70
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,170
Okay. Please wait a moment.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,480
Are you not mad at me anymore?

72
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,120
Why would I be mad at you?

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,730
Do you think I'm that petty?

74
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,879
That's good.

75
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,680
I have something important to tell you.

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
What is it?

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Well...

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,639
I found the necklace.

79
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
No way.

80
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,610
I gave the restaurant manager a really hard time.

81
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,800
I told them that they had to find the necklace.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,279
They dug deep...

83
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,050
and searched every corner.

84
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,120
They finally found it.

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
It wasn't easy.

86
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,680
Hello, here's your juice.

87
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,199
Enjoy.

88
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,959
That's impossible.

89
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,759
This isn't my necklace.

90
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,519
You're right. It's indeed not your necklace.

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
But...

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,040
I really refuse to believe...

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
that Shi Yi stole your necklace.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,519
Do you like Wu Shi Yi?

95
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,079
What are you saying?

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,319
What does it have to do with the necklace?

97
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,560
If you like Wu Shi Yi,

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,680
then why are you being so nice to me?

99
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,720
Lu Lu, listen.

100
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,959
I'm nice to you.

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,800
You're like a little sister to me, right?

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
When you're bullied...

103
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,519
or when you suffer injustice,

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,000
as your brother, I can't ignore you.

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,240
But who is Wu Shi Yi?

106
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
She's my bodyguard.

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,959
She risks her life every day for me.

108
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
You're picking on her...

109
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,959
and you don't believe her.

110
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,079
If that's the case,

111
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,199
we can't be friends.

112
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,959
So...

113
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,319
you just bought a fake necklace...

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,279
so that I'll drop the case, right?

115
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
I do want you to drop the case.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,560
I think this necklace...

117
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,759
is not that important...

118
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,480
compared to Shi Yi's future.

119
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,560
If you don't drop the case, her future will be ruined.

120
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,160
I want to ruin her.

121
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
Just let her get ruined.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,759
What gives her the right...

123
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,360
to be with you all the time...

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,399
while I can't?

125
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
What did you say?

126
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,959
I...

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Let me put it this way.

128
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,319
Regarding this case, I've considered...

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
I've considered many possibilities.

130
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,439
I've considered that maybe you really dropped it...

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,079
or I've considered that maybe you really...

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,600
forgot it somewhere.

133
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,839
There's one possibility that I really don't want to believe.

134
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,319
You framed Wu Shi Yi.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,079
But looking at it now,

136
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,439
this possibility is very likely.

137
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,839
I didn't.

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,319
I said those things out of anger just now.

139
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,680
Lu Lu, let me give you some advice as your older brother.

140
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
If this is true,

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,199
I want you to drop the case.

142
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,120
I won't cause any trouble for you.

143
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,839
But if you don't drop the case...

144
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,000
and I find any evidence or clues,

145
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,639
I'll hand them over to the police.

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
And I won't forgive you.

147
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,959
I'm leaving.

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,319
Call me when you've thought it through.

149
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,959
I'm not eating anymore.

150
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,160
Why aren't you eating?

151
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,120
They're all your favorites.

152
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,399
He's troubled.

153
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,279
Why aren't you eating either?

154
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,480
Mr. Hou,

155
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,039
this case isn't that big of a deal.

156
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,159
Don't worry.

157
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,240
The results will be out soon.

158
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,759
What do you mean it's no big deal?

159
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,210
What else has to happen for it to be considered a big deal?

160
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
How long will it take for this to be over?

161
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,159
Ten days? Or how much longer?

162
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,159
Shi Yi is being thrown on the floor every day now.

163
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,240
Look at how she's suffering.

164
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,330
No. She's not just being thrown.

165
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,450
She is being kicked too.

166
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,879
During training, the members...

167
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,840
Hey, you.

168
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,360
Even food won't shut you up.

169
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Come on, clean up with me.

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Come on.

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Gosh.

172
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,330
I was up all night.

173
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,799
I'm about to go and drop the case.

174
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,799
Can you come with me?

175
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,039
I'm scared.

176
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,840
Okay, wait for me. I'm coming.

177
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,559
Is he crazy?

178
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,879
What?

179
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,159
You're dropping the case?

180
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,600
Yes, I want to drop the case.

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,450
This is a criminal case.

182
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,679
It can't be dropped just like that.

183
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,210
Sir. Wu Shi Yi definitely didn't steal the necklace.

184
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,090
Even if there's a misunderstanding, it must be someone else.

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
It can't be Shi Yi.

186
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,279
Go over there and find out the details.

187
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,639
You're right.

188
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,519
It was indeed someone else.

189
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,090
Did you catch him?

190
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,759
Our police squad checked all the security cameras...

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,240
in the area according to the clues we have.

192
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,879
We directed our suspicions to Wang Ma Li.

193
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,840
When our disguised policemen went to Wang Ma Li's place...

194
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,330
to investigate and pick her up,

195
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,240
she was about to leave with the necklace on her.

196
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,720
There's a number carved on the clasp of this necklace.

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,200
It's like proof of identity.

198
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,039
We just checked Wang Ma Li's necklace.

199
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,480
It's the one you lost.

200
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,440
Fang Lu, is there anything else you want to tell us?

201
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Has the necklace been found?

202
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,559
Yes.

203
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,000
Where was it?

204
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,240
Ms. Shi Yi.

205
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Lu Lu.

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,759
Ms. Shi Yi.

207
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,559
Ms. Shi Yi, please talk to them.

208
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,200
- Please forgive me. - What are you doing?

209
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
What's wrong? Calm down.

210
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,919
I'm still too young. I was too willful.

211
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,919
I won't do it again.

212
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,960
Can you tell them to forgive me?

213
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,519
Fang Lu.

214
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
We need you to cooperate with us for a statement right now.

215
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,879
Hou Jue.

216
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
This counts as coming to turn ourselves in, right?

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,799
Will things be okay since I turned myself in?

218
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,159
That...

219
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
It's not up to me to say whether things will be okay.

220
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,440
- Fang Lu. - What do I do then?

221
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,559
Come and give us your statement, Fang Lu.

222
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
Come on.

223
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,159
Cooperate with the police investigation first.

224
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Come on.

225
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,279
I'm sorry. You've suffered the past few days.

226
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
Why are you apologizing?

227
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,600
It's not your fault.

228
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,600
But this all started because of me.

229
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,159
Fang Lu and Wang Ma Li...

230
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,879
confessed to framing Wu Shi Yi.

231
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,840
Their testimonies are basically the same.

232
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Thank you.

233
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,200
Thank you for giving me justice.

234
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
It's what we should do.

235
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
The clues you gave us helped us solve the case.

236
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
You were of great help.

237
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,559
We should thank you too.

238
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,879
Sir, then will the two of them be locked up here today?

239
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,919
Unless there's someone suitable willing to bail them out.

240
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,399
He blocked me.

241
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Why are you still bothering him?

242
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,600
I just want to thank him.

243
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,120
If it weren't for him,

244
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,720
we would be crying alone right now.

245
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,440
That's true.

246
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,360
He...

247
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,919
really is quite righteous.

248
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,279
Ma Li.

249
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,480
Let's cancel our contract.

250
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,879
We never had a contract anyway.

251
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,440
It was all verbal.

252
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,519
If you really want to quit, then quit.

253
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,600
I've also been having a hard time these days.

254
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,720
When this is all over,

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,360
I want to go home to be with my mom and dad.

256
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,320
Then I'll see what I can do next.

257
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,759
Ma Li.

258
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,279
Thank you for taking care of me all these years.

259
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,840
Don't say that.

260
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,120
From start to finish,

261
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,679
I was the one who gave you all the ideas for this.

262
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,480
You didn't dump the whole thing on me...

263
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,320
at the police station.

264
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,039
If we're talking about gratitude,

265
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,159
I should be the one to thank you.

266
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,399
I've been working out here all these years.

267
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,919
Honestly, I didn't make that many friends.

268
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
But...

269
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,960
you count as one.

270
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,559
You really can't see things clearly until you experience setbacks.

271
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
To be honest,

272
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,919
all these years,

273
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,080
I didn't make any good friends either.

274
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
But Fang Lu,

275
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,279
you're a really nice girl.

276
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
Ma Li.

277
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,720
I want to be alone for a bit.

278
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
I won't keep you company anymore.

279
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,720
Let's bid farewell here.

280
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,159
All right. I'm leaving.

281
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Taxi!

282
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,039
Wang Chun Hua.

283
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,519
Fang Lu, there are so many people around.

284
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,879
Don't call me by my real name!

285
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
Bye.

286
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,159
Bye.

287
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,559
Go.

288
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,159
Bye.

289
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Hello, everyone.

290
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,879
I'm Fang Lu.

291
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
It has been a while.

292
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Look.

293
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,039
This is where I did my first live broadcast.

294
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Do you remember?

295
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,240
I'm here today...

296
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,119
to say goodbye to you all.

297
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,200
I came here...

298
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,440
because this is the place where I first met all of you.

299
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,410
So...

300
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,559
I wanted to say goodbye here as well.

301
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,319
A lot has happened to me lately.

302
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,359
I met a guy.

303
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,799
He's tall and handsome.

304
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,720
And he's very warmhearted.

305
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,410
He really treated me so well...

306
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,039
and gave me a great sense of security,

307
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,960
like a brother taking care of his little sister.

308
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,279
He helped me a lot.

309
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,240
Even in my dreams,

310
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,960
I wished...

311
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
I could stay by his side forever.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,119
But I did...

313
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,039
I did something wrong.

314
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,359
That's how I lost him.

315
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,359
Everything is over now.

316
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,759
It really feels...

317
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,319
like I was in a dream.

318
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,839
I'd like to sing a song for you all today.

319
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:53,359
I've already closed the rewards function.

320
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,799
Today, you and I...

321
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
are just friends.

322
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,480
Listen carefully to my song,

323
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,279
especially you.

324
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Please listen to it.

325
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,200
- Cheers! - Cheers!

326
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,039
All right, stop taking pictures.

327
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,839
- Come on. - Come on. Cheers.

328
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,000
- Cheers. - Cheers.

329
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,480
This is too much.

330
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,759
Can we eat now?

331
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,170
Yes.

332
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,359
Ms. Shi Yi,

333
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,000
we realize you're getting prettier these days.

334
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Really?

335
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,410
Yes.

336
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,170
It's all thanks to your instructor, Ms. Qian.

337
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,519
Me?

338
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,279
You really should thank me.

339
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
I'm leaving, Zhou Quan.

340
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Mr. Hou Junior.

341
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,200
It's past six o'clock.

342
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,279
Do you want me to order some food for you?

343
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,170
I'm not very hungry.

344
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,119
Sure. Order something.

345
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,799
Okay.

346
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
There's something I want to tell you.

347
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,240
Qian Qian sent a photo to our chat group.

348
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,650
She's having dinner with Shi Yi and the others.

349
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Let me see it.

350
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,920
Ask Qian Qian where they're eating.

351
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,279
Should I ask her?

352
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,440
Yes. I happen to be hungry now. Let's go.

353
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,920
I'm hungry.

354
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,559
Let's go.

355
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,160
Here, quick. Someone, eat this pizza.

356
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,480
- Don't waste it. - It's delicious.

357
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,799
- This is delicious. - I want fries.

358
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,920
- Do you want more fries? - Take this.

359
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
- I want fries. - I want some too.

360
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,240
Don't you guys want fries?

361
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,480
Quiet down.

362
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,799
I have a suggestion.

363
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:19,960
Let us...

364
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,519
raise our glasses...

365
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,240
to celebrate Shi Yi getting her justice...

366
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,559
and her glorious return to the team.

367
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Cheers.

368
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,200
- Cheers. - Cheers.

369
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Cheers.

370
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,039
Keep it down.

371
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,759
Thank you.

372
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,839
Hello. Here are some German treats.

373
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,079
Did we order this?

374
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
No.

375
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,960
It's from a gentleman.

376
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,880
- From a gentleman? - Yes.

377
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,920
Do desserts really fall from the sky like this?

378
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,400
Is that gentleman tall and handsome?

379
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,759
We want to meet him.

380
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,200
Chu Fan, you're so boy crazy.

381
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,519
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

382
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,440
But he already paid the bill and left.

383
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,400
He paid the bill and left?

384
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,079
Enjoy.

385
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,880
So be it.

386
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,960
Who cares about him?

387
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,039
It's a waste if we don't eat these.

388
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,240
Let's eat up. Come on.

389
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,880
Come on, let's eat.

390
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,200
This is so pretty.

391
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Let's take a photo.

392
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,440
It's so pretty. Show me yours.

393
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,559
I think this one looks good.

394
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,759

396
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
(Wiwaso Bierhaus)

397
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,279
Look.

398
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,319
Let me see. Post it in the group chat.

399
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,920
Let me adjust the colors for you.

400
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
For what?

401
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,839
Hurry, this pizza is so good!

402
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,079
- I'm already full. - Don't change the subject.

403
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,720
- Hurry up and show me the picture. - Okay.

404
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,279
Thank you, Dung Beetle Man.

405
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,440
The snitch...

406
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:00,519
was you, right?

407
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,279
I think so.

408
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Let's go.

409
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,839
It feels good.

410
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,200
It's a big and bright moon tonight.

411
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,079
That's because Shi Yi is happy today.

412
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,799
Please be a man for a bit.

413
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,039
You're so annoying. You want to get married so badly.

414
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,960
I just don't want to waste this beautiful night.

415
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,480
All right, baby.

416
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,880
Shi Yi, your client is so sweet.

417
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,319
Unfortunately,

418
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,160
why are all the good men in the world...

419
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,400
taken by bad women?

420
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,640
You're right.

421
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,720
That's the mystery.

422
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,599
Can't you talk to him?

423
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,160
Tell him not to marry that girl.

424
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,119
What does it have to do with me?

425
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,160
That's right.

426
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,720
Dissuasion is considered a good deed too.

427
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,119
I think letting things go with the flow...

428
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,279
is what's considered a good deed.

429
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,720
Go with the flow?

430
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,519
My purse! Help!

431
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,599
Give it back!

432
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,960
It's a robbery! Help! I've been robbed!

433
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,039
Someone, help!

434
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,839
My purse!

435
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
That's amazing.

436
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,839
Robber! Hit him!

437
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,920
- I'll beat you to death! - Is this the police?

438
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,359
I'm reporting a crime.

439
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,680
There's a robbery over here.

440
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,119
Mr. Tian, stop chatting with them.

441
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,079
Hurry and clean up the kitchen.

442
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,240
Check it out. She's a master.

443
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,279
I'll send it to the group chat.

444
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
What is it?

445
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,079
It's a video. I've sent it to our group chat.

446
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,240
- Did you send it? - I did.

447
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,839
It's a robbery! Help! I've been robbed!

448
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,839
Boss.

449
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,880
Why does it...

450
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
look like Ms. Shi Yi?

451
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,759
Why are you prying into other people's privacy?

452
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,319
I'm not.

453
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,799
What is it?

454
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,519
It's so early in the morning. Are you nuts?

455
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm not watching it. You always send me useless videos.

456
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Fine.

457
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,680
This is awesome.

458
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,599
A video was uploaded online last night...

459
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,079
and it has gone viral.

460
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,359
As you can see,

461
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,039
the footage is absolutely exciting.

462
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,559
Some netizens suspect that it's just a gimmick.

463
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,720
But according to reporters' investigation,

464
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
its authenticity is almost confirmed.

465
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,160
This was a motorcycle robbery...

466
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,559
that happened in our city last night.

467
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,680
When the robbers were escaping after the robbery,

468
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,480
they were subdued by a group of bold and righteous girls.

469
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,759
As you can see in the footage,

470
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,160
the whole thing took no more than 10 seconds.

471
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,720
Netizens have been liking and reposting the video.

472
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,200
- Hello. - They're also speculating...

473
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,279
who these mysterious,

474
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,599
- Yes. - strong, and agile girls are.

475
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,200
- This is Eagle Security. - This needs further investigation.

476
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,400
- I'm Mr. Zhao. - Other reports are coming up next.

477
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,079
Hello.

478
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
You're so well-informed.

479
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,559
No wonder you're a reporter.

480
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,279
I also just saw it.

481
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
Yes.

482
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,519
They are from our company.

483
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,160
They were a few of our female bodyguards.

484
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,160
Our company has rules.

485
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,640
We don't publicize our members individually...

486
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,000
nor do we use their real names.

487
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,440
In our line of work,

488
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,559
if we become famous,

489
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,440
how will we do our work?

490
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,559
Here are the steamed buns I made.

491
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,519
- Hurry up and eat. - Let's eat.

492
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,279
- Here, Hou Jue. - It's okay.

493
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,920
Here.

494
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,079
When is Shi Yi going to take over from you?

495
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,039
Take over?

496
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,880
The company wants me to keep serving you.

497
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,160
It's what the client asked for. Don't you know?

498
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,599
I didn't sign the contract with your company.

499
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,640
You won't mind if I ask Shi Yi to come back, right?

500
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Well...

501
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,880
Have I not been doing well?

502
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,400
No. Don't misunderstand.

503
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
You did a very good job.

504
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,480
You've done an outstanding job in all aspects.

505
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,039
But Shi Yi and I...

506
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,599
We were together for a long time, so I'm more familiar with her.

507
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,319
We're like brothers.

508
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,759
You could say we've been through life and death together.

509
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,759
Yes.

510
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,720
That's why I'm more used to her.

511
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,000
So it's because you're used to Shi Yi serving you...

512
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
that you want her to work for you,

513
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,359
not because I didn't do well, right?

514
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,359
That's right.

515
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,359
It's not because of you.

516
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,680
That's a relief.

517
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,519
But...

518
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,680
if you like Shi Yi,

519
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,480
you should just tell her.

520
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,039
I like Shi Yi? I...

521
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,960
We're just closer because we spent a lot of time together.

522
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,839
Right? I told you, we're like brothers.

523
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,960
Then why don't you like her?

524
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,960
I don't dislike her.

525
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I like...

526
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,880
No, I like her too.

527
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,880
Do I like her or not? I...

528
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
We...

529
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,680
Eat first. Eat.

530
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,759
Look at you.

531
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,519
Even you haven't gotten it straight.

532
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,960
All right. Zhou Quan, eat more.

533
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,440
You won't be able to eat this anymore.

534
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,799
Here. Have another bun that I made. Here.

535
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,279
No. That's not what I meant.

536
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,359
I mean...

537
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,119
It's okay, if you want to eat this in the future,

538
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,240
I'll make some and bring them to you.

539
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Eat up. You should eat too.

540
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Here.

541
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,400
You won't be able to eat this anymore.

542
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,519
I'm starving.

543
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,759
Okay, I'll get it for you later.

544
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,240
Don't go. Come on.

545
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Everyone, stop.

546
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,440
Listen to me while you eat.

547
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,119
You've all really stopped.

548
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
That's good too.

549
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,880
What I'm about to say...

550
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,480
is indeed quite serious.

551
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,200
Listen up, everyone.

552
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,319
I'm just scaring you guys.

553
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
It's good news.

554
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,920
I saw the video on the Internet.

555
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,759
Qian Xiao Yan.

556
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Present.

557
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,839
- Wu Shi Yi. - Present.

558
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,599
- Chang Fei Fei. - Present.

559
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Sun Min Fa.

560
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,079
Present.

561
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,599
Wang Da Ni.

562
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,599
Present.

563
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,759
Good job, you five.

564
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,519
I would like to commend you.

565
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
You...

566
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,920
are the entire company's pride.

567
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,839
You're the role models for the whole company.

568
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,880
Although it doesn't seem serious,

569
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,559
you brought glory to the company.

570
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,039
You brought honor to our industry. Give them a round of applause!

571
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,920
I was so scared. I thought something happened.

572
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Me too.

573
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,920
To be honest,

574
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,680
seeing all the good comments online...

575
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,559
makes me a million times happier...

576
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,160
than getting several missions...

577
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,400
and getting acknowledgment from our clients.

578
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,279
According to company regulations,

579
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,599
bold and righteous team members...

580
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,480
will be publicly commended on our company website...

581
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,759
and given a physical reward.

582
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,839
- Great! - This is wonderful!

583
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,839
Also,

584
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,720
I've already talked to the kitchen.

585
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,559
Everyone gets...

586
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,880
1, 2,

587
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,559
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

588
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,240
Nine extra drumsticks for lunch!

589
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,480
As long as you can eat them all!

590
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:12,960
We can't.

591
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
There's more.

592
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,000
- Is there still more, Mr. Zhao? - There's more?

593
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,880
This is very important.

594
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,640
As you all know,

595
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,160
not long ago,

596
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,640
Wu Shi Yi was framed.

597
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
But...

598
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,319
she demonstrated extraordinary professionalism...

599
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,039
by obeying company rules...

600
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,759
and actively participating in the investigation.

601
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,319
She even served as everyone's sparring partner.

602
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,359
She never displayed any negative emotions.

603
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,160
Her behavior...

604
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
helped maintain the company's credibility...

605
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,400
and protected the industry's image.

606
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,240
She also set a prime example...

607
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,400
for anyone who encounters something similar in the future.

608
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,960
Give Shi Yi extra drumsticks!

609
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,519
- Yes! - Okay! Give her 10 extra!

610
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,559
Give her 10 more!

611
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,079
Anyway, everyone,

612
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,720
the purpose of our company...

613
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,119
is to train each of you...

614
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,769
to become the most outstanding team members.

615
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
The best!

616
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,599
Eat up!

617
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Shi Yi.

618
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,639
I have something to tell you.

619
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,000
- Come here. - Yes.

620
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,769
I talked to Zhirong Construction.

621
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,880
They're happy with your work.

622
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,289
However, they think...

623
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,480
it's better for a male bodyguard to serve Hou Jue.

624
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,679
I understand.

625
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
The company has decided.

626
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,000
To commend you for your recent performance,

627
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,719
you'll still be given...

628
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,639
the performance pay as per the contract this month.

629
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,519
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

630
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,719
Shi Yi, rest well.

631
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,159
A new job...

632
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
will come before you know it.

633
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:06,329
Yes.

634
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,519
Mr. Hou.

635
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,559
I bought it.

636
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,559
Come on.

637
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,039
Close the door.

638
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,679
I got the purse you asked for.

639
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,769
Thank you.

640
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,639
Take a look at it.

641
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,199
No.

642
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,079
What if my taste doesn't match yours?

643
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,719
I'll be blamed.

644
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,639
Your taste is much better than mine.

645
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,599
It's okay as long as it's the right brand.

646
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,880
I don't know much about women's purses.

647
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,480
I don't know what looks good.

648
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:54,400
How is the woman?

649
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,039
This woman...

650
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,360
It's hard to say whether she's a good woman or not.

651
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
But...

652
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,199
she's quite remarkable.

653
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,599
Is there anyone you can't get?

654
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,769
That's impossible.

655
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,199
There are people who I can't get.

656
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,360
You're too modest.

657
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,239
Okay, I'll go now.

658
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:20,809
By the way,

659
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,440
how are the floor tiles coming along?

660
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,679
Pay attention to the construction period.

661
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
Make sure to meet the deadline.

662
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,329
I'm doing my best to investigate it.

663
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:29,039
Don't worry. The construction schedule won't be delayed.

664
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,199
I'll remember that.

665
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,920
Go.

666
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,400
- Mr. Hou Junior. - Mr. Ma.

667
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,039
- Hello, Mr. Ma. - Hi.

668
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,559
Where are you going?

669
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,960
- I'm going to the bank. - No.

670
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,880
I have a bunch of receipts. Hurry and reimburse me.

671
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,039
Let's talk about that later. I'm busy.

672
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:55,039
Do it right away.

673
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Hurry up.

674
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,039
Dad, let me tell you.

675
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,599
Shi Yi's case is closed.

676
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,719
It had nothing to do with her.

677
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,119
Okay.

678
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:11,289
It was all Fang Lu and her friend's doing.

679
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,639
Mr. Zhao from the security company told me everything.

680
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,809
Then since you know everything,

681
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:20,079
let's ask Shi Yi to come back to work.

682
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,289
I talked to Mr. Zhao.

683
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,360
I think we should keep that male bodyguard.

684
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,079
Female bodyguards are too much trouble.

685
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,719
How are they troubling?

686
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,809
Shi Yi has done so well at work.

687
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,679
She can serve as a bodyguard and a secretary at the same time.

688
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
She never did anything incompetent, right?

689
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,440
Why do you find her troublesome all of a sudden?

690
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Look at Zhou Quan.

691
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,679
I'm uncomfortable with a new bodyguard.

692
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,039
I'm already used to Shi Yi.

693
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,679
Is it troubling?

694
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's no trouble.

695
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,519
Why are you looking at me?

696
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,960
Why do I think your relationship with Wu Shi Yi...

697
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,360
isn't as simple as a boss and employee?

698
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,159
What do you mean it's not simple?

699
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,400
Dad, what are you talking about?

700
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,239
I just think Shi Yi is quite suitable for the job.

701
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,559
Isn't that right?

702
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,639
If you don't want to change bodyguards, then never mind.

703
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,639
We'll go with the male then.

704
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
Let's not change bodyguards.

705
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:14,400
Fine, we won't do it.

706
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,960
Mr. Ma, you're here.

707
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,079
Mr. Ma is here.

708
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,199
Mr. Ma.

709
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:39,079
Ms. Hong, please reimburse me.

710
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,239
Don't call me that.

711
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,400
You're making me sound old.

712
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:45,440
It makes me seem young.

713
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,039
Mr. Ma, why aren't you married yet?

714
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,079
You...

715
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,559
That really hit home.

716
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,039
Think about it.

717
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,159
Girls these days...

718
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,809
want to be consoled, kept company, and taken care of.

719
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,360
The company is like my home.

720
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,880
I have no time for that.

721
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,809
I had two girlfriends before.

722
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,400
When I got too busy, they dumped me right away.

723
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,239
Mr. Ma, do you like anyone now?

724
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,880
Yes, Mr. Ma. Tell us.

725
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,960
Are there any girls you like right now?

726
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:27,400
Are you...

727
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
trying to recommend me to go on a dating show?

728
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,440
Do you want to be representatives of my friends and family?

729
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,679
- What do you think of Tian Tian? - Yes.

730
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,809
Who's Tian Tian?

731
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Tian Min.

732
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,079
Tian Tian?

733
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:47,840
- Office romances are forbidden. - Ms. Tian.

734
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,920
We all know that.

735
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,809
Do you want Mr. Hou to fire me?

736
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,920
Tian Min is young and pretty.

737
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,159
And she's so smart.

738
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,809
I don't deserve her.

739
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,559
That's hard to say.

740
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,289
You have no idea.

741
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
Every time we talk about you,

742
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,880
you should see Tian Min's eyes and expression.

743
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,039
You just haven't seen it.

744
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,039
- Exactly. - That's right.

745
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,400
I think she likes you.

746
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,519
That's right. She likes you.

747
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,679
She has liked you for a long time.

748
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,199
We can all see it.

749
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,289
- We all know. - That's enough. I'm begging you.

750
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,769
Stop making fun of me, all right?

751
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,719
I'll be honest with you.

752
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,239
She's not my type at all.

753
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,840
I like rich and elegant girls.

754
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,920
It's true. Look.

755
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,159
I work like a dog every day.

756
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,159
When I go home and lie on the couch,

757
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:40,480
if someone can bring me food and wash my clothes,

758
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,880
that would be so relaxing.

759
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,809
If there's anyone like that, you have to introduce her to me.

760
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,880
I only want serious relationships, okay?
