4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Shi Yi!

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Let me explain.

6
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,560
I really didn't cheat on you.

7
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,040
Shi Yi.

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
I really didn't cheat on you.

9
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,480
Trust me.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Stop right there!

11
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,120
Here's my number.

12
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,039
I will compensate you and your car later.

13
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,120
Won't you apologize?

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,479
No!

15
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,000
Fine. Never mind then.

16
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,120
- Where's your boss? - Our boss is inside.

18
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,039
Monkey, you are just in time...

19
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,719
You've come at the right time to waste one of my eggs.

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,479
Leave it.

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,759
Eggs are over seven yuan per kilogram now.

22
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,759
The buying price is six yuan per kilogram.

23
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,759
In that case, each egg costs one yuan.

24
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,039
I cooked it from scratch.

25
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,120
With my creativity, the egg is worth 3.5 yuan each.

26
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,280
Altogether, I lost at least three yuan.

27
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,199
What happened to you?

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
What's wrong with your waist?

29
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,759
Huang Yue is getting married. Do you know that?

30
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,479
You are such a bad friend.

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Getting married is a big deal. Why didn't you discuss it with me?

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
Did you ask for my permission?

33
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,240
Huang Yue is getting married,

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,479
but the groom is not me.

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,280
Your girlfriend is getting married, but you are not the groom?

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,199
Are you serious?

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,000
I think if I've been cheated on.

38
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,000
That doesn't matter at all, Monkey.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
You know what? It's a good thing.

40
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,759
First of all, I never liked that girl in the first place.

41
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,240
She is nothing but a vase.

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,439
She's not interesting at all.

43
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,520
You can easily find someone like her on the street.

44
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,599
I'll introduce you to a good girl who can take care of the house...

45
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,800
and who is hardworking, okay?

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,360
No, I was pathetic.

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,680
I was disgusting.

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,879
I treated her with all my heart and soul.

49
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,080
I only cared about her.

50
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,479
I did this and that.

51
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,159
Those episodes just popped out all of a sudden.

52
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,919
Well...

53
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,759
Go and find out...

54
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,050
with whom she has cheated on me.

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,439
Fine, I'll do it for you.

56
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,839
Can I ask a question?

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
Who caused the injury to your waist?

58
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,050
You dropped your egg.

59
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,399
Is that delicious, Tian Tian?

60
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,879
You're a grown-up. Why did you eat something from the ground?

61
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,959
That's disgusting.

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,879
It's not the egg, it's the money. Every cent counts.

63
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,920
It irritates me just by looking.

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
Here, Hai Xing Fried Rice version 2.0.

65
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,800
The smiley face made just for you.

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
I can't stand that smiley face!

67
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,730
Zhu Da Peng.

68
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,730
Didn't you say you broke up with her?

69
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,170
Why is she so angry?

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,199
I don't know.

71
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm telling you.

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,959
I, Li Xue Mei, am a decent lady.

73
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,759
Don't think that...

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
you can fool me.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,639
What are you saying?

76
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,199
Am I that kind of person?

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,730
I told her, but she didn't accept it.

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,730
What can I do?

79
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,240
You could have dated anyone.

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,050
Why do you have to date a female bodyguard?

81
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,879
Do you think you can put up with the beatings?

82
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
I was young, foolish,

83
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,000
and vain.

84
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,240
Two days ago, Zhu Da Peng said...

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,639
we've known each other for three years.

86
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Throughout the period,

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,319
we spent time together for less than two months.

88
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,160
Tell me.

89
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,800
Is it my fault that he is having an affair?

90
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,399
Even if it were someone else,

91
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,279
that's what would happen too, right?

92
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,040
Not necessarily.

93
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,759
If it were someone else,

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
if he couldn't understand and support your career,

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,959
he would have requested a breakup.

96
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,480
It's the least one could do.

97
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,519
He, on the other hand,

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,839
said that he wants to marry you...

99
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,199
while fooling around with another woman.

100
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,319
What nonsense is this? He's a jerk. A total jerk.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm begging you.

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,680
Don't give him any more excuses. Do you understand?

103
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,279
I trusted him too much.

104
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
I believed anything he said.

105
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,920
He fooled me completely.

106
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,120
Why is love so unreliable?

107
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,079
It's not that love is unreliable.

108
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,600
Your relationship with him was never reliable in the first place.

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,360
You said it yourself. You were together for three years.

110
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,600
Throughout the three years,

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
you only met up with him when you were on leave.

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,040
You kept in touch with him through WeChat and video calls.

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,800
The pair of you didn't fight or get into conflicts.

114
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,600
The temperature of your relationship is around 30 degrees Celsius.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
Honey.

116
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,279
It's below body temperature.

117
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,879
You would feel cold taking a shower at that temperature.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,319
But isn't it better to live a simple life?

119
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,360
What should I do?

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,399
Should I try to kill myself...

121
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,920
when I haven't seen him for a day?

122
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,040
That's not true.

123
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm just curious.

124
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,360
Why is it so hard?

125
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,199
Tell me.

126
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
My dad...

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
has been...

128
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,879
struggling all these years.

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,639
All his savings are gone.

130
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,920
I know.

131
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,680
He's trying to prove my mom wrong.

132
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
He wants to prove himself.

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
What can I say?

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,519
I can't say anything.

135
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,639
I'm his daughter.

136
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,680
I have no choice but to help him.

137
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,879
But...

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,399
I can't do it anymore.

139
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,199
I've been paying debts for so many years.

140
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,879
I spent all my savings,

141
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,439
but I still haven't cleared all of them.

142
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
I dated Zhu Da Peng...

143
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,360
for three years.

144
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,040
It's gone just like that.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,079
As for myself,

146
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,720
my stamina is getting worse.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
I can't get any big case.

148
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,639
I even got a complaint from a client.

149
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,160
Why is it so hard for me?

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm so close to breaking down.

151
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,879
What are you doing?

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
What are you doing?

153
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,240
- I'm going home. - No, please calm down.

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,720
After I've taken care of what has to be taken care of, we'll...

155
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,840
What?

156
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,090
I'm your girlfriend.

157
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,279
Isn't it only right for me to go to your house?

158
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,919
No, I...

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,799
I don't feel well.

160
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,919
I feel worse.

161
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,279
What a nice house.

162
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,279
She got all this for you, right?

163
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,639
I don't think they suit you.

164
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,679
Yes, everything you said is right.

165
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,720
It's huge. What did you buy?

166
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,759
Be careful. Don't scratch the door.

167
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
Move to the left.

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Slowly.

169
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,159
- My goodness. - What is it, Li Li?

170
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,210
I don't know. Mr. Hou Junior bought it.

171
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,559
This way.

172
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Hou Junior bought it? It's so big.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,210
- Mr. Hou Junior. - It's so big.

174
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,960
- Your parcel is here. - What is it?

175
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,279
- He always does this. - That's quick.

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
- Be careful. - Here.

177
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,559
Take it apart.

178
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,840
Open it.

179
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,080
It's a chair.

180
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,279
Don't scratch it.

181
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Slow down.

182
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,720
- Look at this. - I love the color.

183
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,440
What do you think? Touch the leather.

184
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
It's calfskin leather.

185
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,480
What do you think? Have a seat.

186
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,559
I can tell that it's of good quality just by looking.

187
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,679
How is it?

188
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,039
- That feels good. - Doesn't it?

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,159
- Give it a try. - Come and see it.

190
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,240
Turn around.

191
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,480
That's my seat.

192
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,679
That's an especially good angle.

193
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,960
So it won't hurt your back when you're sitting in the chair.

194
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,120
It's comfortable. Do you know that?

195
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,919
Sitting in your current chair...

196
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,440
makes your back and legs hurt.

197
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,519
Mr. Hou.

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,320
Take a seat and give it a try.

199
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,120
What angle?

200
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,519
Where did this chair come from?

201
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,840
I just bought it.

202
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
You are so rich.

203
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,360
This chair doesn't suit you.

204
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,559
Move it.

205
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Move it?

206
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,919
What do you mean?

207
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
Are you moving it to your place?

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't do that. I just bought it. Let me try it for two days.

209
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,120
I'll order a new one for you.

210
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,679
Thank you, but I don't need it.

211
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,879
Office chairs are provided for the employees...

212
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,200
as per the regulations.

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,759
You can't break the rules for your own comfort.

214
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,799
Do you understand?

215
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,879
I mean, my chair...

216
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,519
I don't know how I should put it.

217
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,159
For some reason, after sitting in the chair,

218
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,080
my back as well as my backside hurt.

219
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
It's really affecting my work.

220
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,399
This chair is different.

221
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,919
Everyone in the company...

222
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,600
has never lodged a complaint for this very reason.

223
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
No one is saying anything.

224
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,679
You're the only one who feels uncomfortable.

225
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,519
Is there a problem here?

226
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,600
Dad, listen.

227
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,039
Let me tell you something in a serious manner.

228
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,919
Where is the essence of design?

229
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,799
- Where is it? - It's about the anatomy.

230
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,240
This chair brings so much comfort.

231
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
You've been a designer for so long.

232
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,519
You should know it very well, right?

233
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,240
I only know the company rules...

234
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
is more important than your body structure.

235
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,759
Your backside isn't special.

236
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,960
Get this chair out of my sight.

237
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,320
This is not a negotiation.

238
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,559
This is an order, okay?

239
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,919
Order?

240
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,159
Does he think he's the president?

241
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm not moving it.

242
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
If I move it, I'll call you Father.

243
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,879
Open the door.

244
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,759
Open the door, Zhu Da Peng.

245
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Shi Yi is here.

246
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,320
Don't be afraid.

247
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,279
I've chained up the door.

248
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,639
She can't come in.

249
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,960
Open the door, Zhu Da Peng!

250
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,879
Don't talk.

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
I'll send her away.

252
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,559
Don't talk.

253
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Shi Yi.

254
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,360
I've sent your luggage...

255
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,679
to the management.

256
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,120
I'm here for my gold medal.

257
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,200
Open the door.

258
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,279
I'll get it for you.

259
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,360
Don't touch it.

260
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,279
I'll get it. Don't touch it.

261
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,679
No way.

262
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,039
What if you come in and hit me again?

263
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,200
Is she inside?

264
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:01,879
No, there's no one.

265
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,440
I warn you.

266
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,639
Open the door.

267
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,519
I'll leave after I get the gold medal.

268
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,519
Don't force me.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,679
No, don't force me.

270
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
I promise.

271
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,559
I won't touch it and I'll take it out for you.

272
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,519
Okay, I'll go now.

273
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,679
Here.

274
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,200
The door looks good.

275
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
You have good taste.

276
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,879
The manufacturer is having a promotion now.

277
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,720
You only have to pay 10 percent of the full price to try it.

278
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,399
We'll install it for you.

279
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,679
Pay the rest if you're satisfied with your three-day trial.

280
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,759
Take this model as an example.

281
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,320
This is one of our classics.

282
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,559
The security level is through the roof.

283
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,159
You can't open it without the key.

284
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes.

285
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,159
We will check out the others.

286
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,200
- Let's go. - I'll take a look at the others.

287
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,279
Okay, take care.

288
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,879
Is this door strong?

289
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,519
Our door is really strong.

290
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,600
Look at our billboard.

291
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,919
When Xinhui is in, thieves are out.

292
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,080
If someone is locked from the inside, can they escape?

293
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,559
Technically,

294
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,279
they will starve to death or they jump off the building.

295
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,559
- I'll take it. - All right, miss.

296
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,759
Leave it here.

297
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,759
Right here.

298
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,399
This is a security door.

299
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,720
It's not sturdy.

300
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,879
Someone who is not supposed to go in went in anyway.

301
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,240
- Put it on. - Okay.

302
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,200
But can I see your ID or residence certificate?

303
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,960
We have to be responsible to the owner too.

304
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,360
The address on your ID card...

305
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,519
doesn't correspond with this address.

306
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
Shi Yi.

307
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
What are you doing? Are you installing a security door?

308
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,039
Yes.

309
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
Are you going for soccer, Mr. Li?

310
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
Yes.

311
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
Okay, see you.

312
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,170
See you later.

313
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
What's wrong?

314
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,720
Do I have to call all the neighbors to verify my identity?

315
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,359
I'm sorry. I'll install the door right away.

316
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,599
- Come on. - Okay.

317
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,839
Put it up.

318
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,279
What's wrong?

319
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,920
It's a security door.

320
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,519
Is she locking us up?

321
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,599
Go on.

322
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,279
Where?

323
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,079
Deal with her.

324
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,519
Go ahead if you can take the beating.

325
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,559
I...

326
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,720
I'll beat you.

327
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,440
Hai Xing!

328
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,519
You got it here.

329
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,599
How did you get it here?

330
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,720
Did you push it?

331
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,000
What else? Do you expect me to carry it here?

332
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,319
What a spoiled brat. You aren't making good use of the wheels.

333
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,920
Stop looking at it. Get it up.

334
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,650
Not bad. Nice leather.

335
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,799
- Let's go. - Of course.

336
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,960
Does it cost a thousand yuan?

337
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,039
Mr. Tian!

338
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,890
- Mr. Tian! - I'm coming.

339
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,200
This one...

340
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,519
If you turn it to the left twice,

341
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
it'll be locked.

342
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,440
The door is locked from inside if you turn thrice.

343
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,650
In that case, people inside can't come out...

344
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,279
unless he has a key.

345
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,000
Here.

346
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,559
Thank you.

347
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,599
You're welcome.

348
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,839
Come back in three days...

349
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,440
and collect money from a guy called Zhu Da Peng.

350
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,759
Don't worry. He has the money.

351
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,240
All right.

352
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,839
Don't worry. The door is strong.

353
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,759
This model, X7,

354
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,039
uses the latest 4.4-liter V8 engine...

355
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,890
that pumps 530 horsepower.

356
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,440
It comes with xDrive,

357
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,890
the intelligent all-wheel drive system.

358
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,359
It has immensely improved driving pleasure and comfort.

359
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,359
Hello.

360
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,200
- Excuse me, can I ask something? - Hello.

361
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,650
How can I help you?

362
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,410
- It's her. - It's okay. Thank you.

363
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,440
- It's her. - She's quite pretty.

364
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,410
Hello.

365
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,519
I'm sorry about the other day.

366
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,039
How much is the repair cost?

367
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,960
Take a look at the bill yourself.

368
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,000
It's 3,800 yuan?

369
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,170
What's wrong?

370
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,960
It's imported.

371
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,890
Don't you know how much the paint costs?

372
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,279
It was a huge scratch.

373
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,279
I was going to claim from the insurance company,

374
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,440
but you insisted on taking responsibility.

375
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,279
Well, I can't stop you from doing so.

376
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,410
Yes. Actually, I...

377
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,839
You don't know.

378
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,759
Give me the code.

379
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,599
Well, she's quite forthright.

380
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,319
Here's the payment code.

381
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,119
All right.

382
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,519
Why is it 660 yuan?

383
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,680
What does it mean?

384
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,640
That's all I have right now.

385
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,839
Are you negotiating...

386
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,720
about the compensation with 660 yuan?

387
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,519
You've got to be kidding me.

388
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
I owe you the rest.

389
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,960
I'll transfer the money to you once I receive my salary.

390
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,640
Just apply the same interest rate as the banks.

391
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,960
Are you a scammer?

392
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,799
You hit my car on purpose...

393
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,839
and promised that you would compensate me.

394
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,720
Now, you're back tricking me into giving you my bank account number.

395
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,519
I don't mind giving her my bank account number.

396
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,519
Take a picture.

397
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,160
You can sue me if I don't pay you back.

398
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,920
- "Wu Shi Yi." - Well...

399
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,079
What kind of name is this?

400
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,880
Well, it's possible.

401
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
- Wait, don't... - Send me your account number.

402
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,880
What a temper.

403
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,440
Nowadays, debtors are...

404
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,279
more powerful.

405
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,000
She's quite cool.

406
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,880
We hit the jackpot.

407
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey!

408
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,039
The car in front...

409
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,559
Look at mine.

410
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,160
Do you know what a rear collision is?

411
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,359
You're fully responsible.

412
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,960
Buddy, why am I fully responsible?

413
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,599
You're the last vehicle. Of course you are fully liable.

414
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,000
- Stop calling me buddy. - You...

415
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,480
- Let's be reasonable. You... - Just now...

416
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,039
You changed lanes suddenly.

417
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,519
You didn't switch on signals or slow down, right?

418
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,279
When did you see me switching lanes...

419
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,640
without slowing down or switching on signals?

420
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,759
It's no fun when you talk like that.

421
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,400
- We all saw you. - How is that no fun?

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,960
- When did you see... - What are you doing?

423
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,240
Take a picture and leave it to the traffic police.

424
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,279
That's right. Take a picture...

425
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Hey!

426
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,119
- Who told you to take a picture? - What are you doing?

427
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:02,599
What do you think you're doing?

428
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:03,640
Pick it up.

429
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,680
I'll get it.

430
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,200
Are you talking to me?

431
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,079
- You're getting physical. - Pick it up.

432
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,640
I've been in the cell for years.

433
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,920
I couldn't vent out on anyone.

434
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,079
It's suffocating.

435
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,599
You won the lottery today.

436
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,960
Haven't you been unable to vent out on anyone...

437
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,400
or have you lost your mind after getting beaten up?

438
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,759
- You... - Why are you...

439
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,160
Why are you getting physical?

440
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,240
Monkey, don't...

441
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,319
Who are you?

442
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,039
Do we know each other?

443
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,480
Hey.

444
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
All right.

445
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,359
You are something.

446
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,400
It's a fight between men, but you ask a girl to help you out.

447
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,519
What's wrong?

448
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,200
I don't hit women, you know?

449
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,279
Do you know Pier 5?

450
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,680
See you there tomorrow at 12pm.

451
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,519
- You little... - Let's fight one-on-one.

452
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,000
If you don't go, I'll post this online.

453
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,279
I'll make you disgusted.

454
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,240
Don't you dare to bring her.

455
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,039
Who is he?

456
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,440
What a piece of junk he's driving.

457
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,039
What a junk.

458
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,400
Are you okay?

459
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,799
Look.

460
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,559
I know you can fight.

461
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,359
Attack when the timing is right, okay?

462
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
No.

463
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,359
If you two keep fighting,

464
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,799
one of you might get injured.

465
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,200
Let alone the medical fees,

466
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,720
you will be arrested for fighting.

467
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,799
I was helping you.

468
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,960
I don't need your help.

469
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,839
I was winning.

470
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,960
I'm going to knock him out with one punch.

471
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Why must you interrupt?

472
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay, for your chivalry and righteousness,

473
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,720
let's forget about the money you owe me.

474
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
But from today...

475
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,839
No, I mean from now onwards,

476
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,200
until forever and ever,

477
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,079
don't let me see you again, okay?

478
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
That's great.

479
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,880
See yourself out.

480
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,599
She's crazy.

481
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,400
My liver hurts.

482
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:11,920
He almost killed me.

483
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,000
Why are you so rash?

484
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,519
He's a fighter.

485
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,680
Where's my phone?

486
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,680
My liver hurts.

487
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,720
Take a look.

488
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,519
- It didn't break. It's all right. - The quality is not bad.

489
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,599
He almost broke my ribs.

490
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,599
- Let's go. - That lady is pretty impressive.

491
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,000
Come in.

492
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,920
Mr. Hou.

493
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,359
Hou Jue's best friend, Hai Xing, just gave me a call.

494
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,440
What did he say?

495
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,079
He called to inform that Mr. Hou Junior...

496
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,559
irritated a labor reform inmate for some reason.

497
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,640
What?

498
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,960
He's meeting with him tomorrow at noon for a one-on-one fight.

499
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,400
I told him to stop Mr. Hou Junior at all costs.

500
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,720
If not, something bad would happen.

501
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,799
Hai Xing couldn't stop him and had no other choices...

502
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,799
but to tell me.

503
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,319
What should I do?

504
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,759
That little punk!

505
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,519
He just has to get into trouble.

506
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,240
Otherwise, he feels uneasy.

507
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,559
Don't worry.

508
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,279
Is he trying to kill me?

509
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,160
Get him here right now.

510
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,599
Go. Get him.

511
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,799
You...

512
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,839
I...

513
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,759
You know Hou Jue's temper.

514
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:28,039
If I call him now,

515
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,680
the pair of you will get into a fight.

516
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,680
Hai Xing reminded me.

517
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,039
He said Hou Jue mustn't know that he was the informer.

518
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,599
He can't do it.

519
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,839
Why don't we find another way?

520
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,799
There's no way.

521
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Ma Yong.

522
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,319
Can you find that gangster?

523
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll see what I can do,

524
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,079
but I can't guarantee it.

525
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,599
Okay.

526
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,519
Red dragon.

527
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,240
Four strands.

528
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,400
Kong.

529
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Good for you, kid.

530
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
My gosh.

531
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Red dragon.

532
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,319
Can you hurry up?

533
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,559
Here comes the money.

534
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,640
Play your card.

535
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,000
- Seven of characters! - Stay still.

536
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,359
I win.

537
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,319
His name is Liu Tie Hao.

538
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,960
I got in touch with him thanks to someone.

539
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,799
- He was sentenced to jail... - Again.

540
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,799
for three years for fighting.

541
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,119
He just came out not long ago.

542
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,319
He targeted Mr. Hou Junior for some unknown reasons.

543
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,039
He's not going to back down...

544
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,400
if he doesn't receive 100,000 yuan.

545
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,279
It has never crossed my mind.

546
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,000
Why would I liaise with such a thug?

547
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,519
It would be embarrassing if it gets out.

548
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,000
Go to the accountant and withdraw 100,000 yuan.

549
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,079
Tell him to come at the time they agreed to meet up...

550
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,160
to get the money.

551
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,799
I want to make sure that by then...

552
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,200
that he's not at Pier 5.

553
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
Don't worry, Mr. Hou.

554
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,680
I have sent the top two bodyguards from the Security Department...

555
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,839
to protect Mr. Hou Junior.

556
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,240
If Liu Tie Hao doesn't honor his words,

557
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,799
at least we have someone to watch him over there.

558
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,759
Hey. What are you doing?

559
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,559
My boss wants to see your picture.

560
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,759
That's the only way to prove...

561
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,119
that you are not at Pier 5.

562
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,160
My eyes are closed.

563
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,079
You're a labor reprieve whether you close your eyes or not.

564
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,359
Watch your mouth.

565
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,599
Nice. You're smart.

566
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,279
That's enough.

567
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,960
Hey.

568
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,400
What are you doing?

569
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Who sent you?

570
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Mr. Hou Junior.

571
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,720
Mr. Hou told us to protect you.

572
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Mr. Hou?

573
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,759
It's always Mr. Hou.

574
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,799
Leave now!

575
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Now!

576
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,000
You!

577
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,039
Stand there.

578
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,079
Come back.

579
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,960
Why are you here?

580
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,640
Who sent you?

581
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,359
I'm here to see.

582
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,359
He's not here.

583
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,519
You can go now.

584
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,079
What's there to see? Tell me if there's anything interesting.

585
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,279
How do you know he isn't here?

586
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:01,759
What if he comes?

587
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,759
What if he comes and runs away when he sees you?

588
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,200
I can't even explain it. Do you know?

589
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,079
Why are you so annoying?

590
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,599
Does it have anything to do with you?

591
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,079
Why are you here? It's fine.

592
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,400
I feel bad if I don't come.

593
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,480
I don't like owing people.

594
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,839
Even if I'm unable to help you out,

595
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,759
I feel reassured and we're even.

596
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,119
Moving forward, it's impossible for you to even make me come.

597
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
What do you owe me?

598
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,559
Now that you are here, you are indebted to me.

599
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,640
It's none of your business. Stay out of it.

600
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,160
You can't do anything but cause trouble.

601
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,640
It's embarrassing.

602
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,000
That's so embarrassing.

603
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,720
Hello?

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,039
Ms. Zhang.

605
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,920
Slow down.

606
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm coming back now. It's okay. I'm coming back.

607
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,519
I'm coming.

Hou Jue, you're finally back.

Look how scary it is. My goodness.

They were already here when I got back from the market.

We are living in the property under your care.

I'm sorry.

00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,519
Ms. Zhang already called the police...

and they have taken photos for evidence.

It hasn't dried up.

Check the CCTV footage to see who did it.

630
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,289
The security camera just happened to be broken.

We're fixing it now.

Don't worry.

I'll take better care of the management from now on.

634

Go and fix the CCTV footage.

Call the manufacturer.

Okay. I'm sorry.

00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,039
I went grocery shopping.

When I came back...

640
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,329
If I didn't go grocery shopping, bad guys wouldn't have gotten in.

641
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:15,480
- The incident wouldn't take place. - It's a good thing.

642
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,519
It's more dangerous if you were at home when they came in.

643
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,519
That would worry me more.

644

Hurry up and wipe it. It's painful to look at.

I'll clean it.

I'm sorry, Mr. Hou.

It's all my fault.

00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,329
I have one here.

662
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,719
It's the same.

663
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,840
When I received the first letter,

664
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,639
I just thought someone...

665
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,360
was trying to blackmail me.

666
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,079
They were after money.

667
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:16,000
Now, I don't think it's as easy as it looks.

668
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,599
One of them is openly asking for money...

669
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,039
while the other is threatening in the dark.

670
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:25,920
Hou Jue has offended two great villains.

671
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,920
You're absolutely right.

672
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,199
They are two great villains.

673
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:35,960
Aren't we in big trouble?

674
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,199
In order to keep Hou Jue safe,

675
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,079
we should send him abroad and lie low for a while.

676
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,199
We just brought him back from overseas.

677
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,360
Are you sending him away again?

678
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,440
It's basically setting a tiger back to the mountain.

679
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,329
If I let him out, who knows what he'll do?

680
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:48,360
Besides,

681
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,719
there's no guarantee that it's safer abroad.

682
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,960
Do you understand?

683
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,809
Even Hou Jue's residence is no longer safe.

684
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,679
Are you not going to hide him away?

685
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,440
What about...

686
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,289
getting him a bodyguard?

687
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,960
Look, you are in deep trouble too.

688
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,840
But you didn't think about hiring bodyguards for yourself.

689
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,360
You prioritize your son instead.

690
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,809
What can I do?

691
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm his dad.

692
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,079
What about...

693
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,719
getting a female bodyguard for him?

694
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,400
Let's find someone older.

695
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,519
She can protect him...

696
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,960
and take care of him at the same time.

697
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,360
It's one thing to avoid him from getting hurt.

698
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,639
What's more important is...

699
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:36,289
to stop him from messing around.

700
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:39,119
Didn't you say...

701
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,679
the girl who saved me...

702
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,159
is a bodyguard?

703
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,079
She's not bad.

704
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,000
I saw her ID.

705
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,440
She works for Eagle Security.

706
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,880
Her name is Wu Shi Yi.

707
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:53,769
That girl looks so skinny and timid.

708
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,239
At first, I really thought she was a secretary.

709
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,559
I need someone like that.

710
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,840
She appears calm and mature.

711
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,639
On top of that, she was righteous.

712
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,880
I'm sure she has good quality.

713
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,199
What about this?

714
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:07,519
Let's go to Eagle Security now.

715
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,719
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

716
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:19,769
Okay, I'll be right there.

717
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Here.

718
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,440
- This is Shi Yi's profile. - Excuse me.

719
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,519
Come in.

720
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,769
Shi Yi, come here.

721
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,769
Mr. Hou.

722
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,199
Shi Yi, take a look.

723
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Do you know him?

724
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,639
Hello.

725
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:42,809
Hello.

726
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,289
Mr. Hou specifically asked for you.

727
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,679
He wants you to protect his son for three months.

728
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,159
You'll start tomorrow.

729
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:54,960
Thank you for the acknowledgment, Mr. Hou.

730
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,239
Shi Yi.

731
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,079
Why didn't you tell me about Zhirong Construction?

732
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:01,360
It's the company's policy.

733
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,639
There can never be any reason to harm the client's interests.

734
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,289
I don't want to defend myself.

735
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,039
After all, it's my fault for not finishing my work on time.

736
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,920
Shi Yi, well done.

737
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,519
You're a righteous woman.

738
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,840
The company will reward you for that.

739
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,719
Mr. Hou, please explain the situation to Shi Yi.

740
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,480
I'll do it.

741
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:22,329
Well...

742
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,329
This is a photo of Hou Jue.

743
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm sure you saw him that day.

744
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,960
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

745
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,239
- Good morning, Mr. Hou Junior. - Good morning, Mr. Hou Junior.

746
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,039
Good morning, Mr. Hou Junior.

747
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,769
- Good morning, Mr. Hou Junior. - Good morning, Mr. Hou Junior.

748
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,360
- Mr. Hou Junior. - Mr. Hou Junior.

749
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:28,289
Li Li, make me some coffee.

750
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,119
Hello, Mr. Hou Junior.

751
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:40,400
Li Li!

752
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,480
Where's Li Li?

753
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,880
- I'm here. - Li Li...

754
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,039
Which department is she from?

755
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,329
She is your new assistant.

756
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:50,639
I just got a call from the Human Resources Department.

757
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:52,769
It's decided.

758
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm Wu Shi Yi, your assistant.

759
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,000
It's my first day.

760
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,039
Nice to meet you.

761
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,960
I didn't know I had an assistant.

762
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,039
Who hired her?

763
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,639
Mr. Hou.

764
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,079
Who is it?

765
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,840
Mr. Hou Zhi Rong.

766
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,199
Why are you following me?

767
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,400
It's my job.

768
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,639
You have no job. You're fired.

769
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,719
Pack your things and leave.

770
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,119
Go away. Don't follow me.

771
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,289
Don't follow me.

772
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:35,679
Mr. Hou.

773
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:39,809
What is it?

774
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,159
You hired her.

775
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,039
Do you like it?

776
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,519
What is there to like?
