(Episode 38)

4
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,039
Stop drinking.

5
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,919
You've been drinking all day for the past few days.

6
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,370
What's wrong? You're totally wasted.

7
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,840
You're even giving the customers free food.

8
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,439
All our work today was for nothing.

9
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,199
No more white wine. I have to stop drinking white wine.

10
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,759
No more white wine for me.

11
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,810
Fine, white wine is okay. Where do you keep the wine?

12
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,599
I can't let you drink anymore. Gosh.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,039
Sit down.

14
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,960
Sit properly.

15
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,800
No, that's not wine. Goodness.

16
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,159
Behave.

17
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,319
That is vinegar. Gosh!

18
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,840
Stop it and sit down.

19
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,840
I will find a way to fix you.

20
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,680
Gosh.

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,199
Don't you dare fool around again today.

22
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,840
Do you hear me?

23
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,439
My goodness.

24
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,560
Can someone help me out?

25
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,759
- Hello? - Hello?

26
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,479
Hello?

27
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,039
Hou Jue, I need your help.

28
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,560
Hai Xing is drunk again.

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,039
He won't stop talking about you.

30
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,400
Why is he drunk again?

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,719
What's wrong with him lately?

32
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm at my wit's end.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,319
Hurry up and come to Xing and Eight Guests.

34
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,560
Sure, wait for me.

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,639
Why did he get obsessed with drinking?

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,639
He is drunk every day.

37
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,840
Stop it.

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,680
You're finally here.

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,520
Goodness. He has been drinking.

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,560
I couldn't stop him.

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,719
- You're a liar. - What show is this?

42
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,800
He has been drinking nonstop.

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,360
It's even worse today. He drank a lot.

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,879
He said he would hang himself...

45
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,159
and jump into the river to commit suicide.

46
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,159
What should we do?

47
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,280
Talk some sense into him.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
Look at you.

49
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,360
You're so useless.

50
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,000
Monkey, you're here.

51
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,159
Get up.

52
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,560
- Monkey. - Aren't you ashamed?

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,610
You came.

54
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,680
This is embarrassing.

55
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,170
This is so embarrassing.

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,170
I realized...

57
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,399
that I was born to embarrass myself.

58
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,480
No wonder my parents abandoned me.

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
They didn't want to be embarrassed.

60
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,439
What kind of performance is this?

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
He has been like this for the past few days.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,360
What should we do?

63
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,120
- It's complicated. - Put on your clothes, Hai Xing.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,920
- I'm upset because I have lost you. - Help him upstairs.

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,439
- Come on, get dressed. - I have a lot to say, but I can't.

66
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,439
Come on, let's go.

67
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,560
One, two, three.

68
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,519
Don't blame me.

69
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,959
Don't blame me.

71
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,959
It's all my fault.

72
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,120
I'll take care of him.

75
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm afraid something might happen to him.

76
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,720
Why bother? He's completely drunk.

77
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,920
He won't wake up even if you punch him.

78
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Look at this.

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,959
- No. - He's not responding.

80
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,319
It's on the news.

81
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,120
When someone is drunk,

82
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,319
it's dangerous to leave him unattended.

83
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,399
What if something goes wrong?

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't worry. It's late. You should go home.

85
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm worried.

86
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,160
- What's wrong? - You're still so young.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,759
Look at how drunk Hai Xing is. You two...

88
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,279
I have to be responsible for you.

89
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,160
Why?

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,879
I can take care of myself.

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
Hou Jue, I know...

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,560
that you have always wanted to match us up.

93
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,560
But you were afraid it would be a loss for me...

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
whom you regard as your sister.

95
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,959
But it's okay, Hou Jue.

96
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,199
It's fine.

97
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,480
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
You're overthinking it.

99
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
That's not what I meant.

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,199
You should go home early.

101
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,759
Dolly, you may have to stop drinking now.

102
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,480
I didn't drink today.

103
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,319
Even I'm not as bold as you are when I'm drunk.

104
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll get going. Call me when he wakes up.

105
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
All right.

106
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,240
Be careful.

107
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Hello?

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
There is a motorcycle that looks suspicious.

109
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,879
I'll wait here for a while.

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,639
When you come out and drive later,

111
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,959
head straight to the company garage.

112
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,680
Outside vehicles are not allowed at this hour.

113
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,959
It's safer.

114
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,120
Are you at the office now?

115
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,759
I'll be right with you.

116
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,159
I'll go wherever you are.

117
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,960
Go!

118
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,559
- Go! - Go!

119
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,320
It's raining.

120
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
I knew...

121
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,960
you would come.

122
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,919
What's wrong?

123
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,919
Loneliness struck?

124
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,639
Do you have a cure for that?

125
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,639
No.

126
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,679
I'm sick too.

127
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,159
I'm very sick.

128
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,080
I used to think...

129
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
that being busy at work...

130
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,320
and having family and friends...

131
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,159
mean that everything is normal.

132
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,399
But I never knew...

133
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,000
that they didn't know what was on my mind.

134
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,600
Some things...

135
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,519
are better off when no one knows.

136
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,679
I don't have anything to be afraid of.

137
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,159
Have you heard a song...

138
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:19,960
that goes...

139
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,480
"If I Lose You, So What If I Triumph Over the World"?

140
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,519
The lyrics are really good.

141
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,120
If I were the one who wrote it,

142
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,639
I would change it to...

143
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,120
"I'm Willing to Lose the World"...

144
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
"Just to Win You Over".

145
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,360
No one is worth for you to lose the world.

146
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,559
I'm not worth it too.

147
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,120
Why did you come here?

148
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,639
Is it because you can't let go of our relationship?

149
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,320
You still love me,

150
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
don't you?

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,879
I don't know.

152
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,919
Since Hou Jue's mom passed away,

153
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,480
I've never been with anyone nor had any emotional attachment...

154
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,759
until I met you.

155
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,679
I don't know how to love.

156
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,559
Maybe this is not love.

157
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,799
It's okay.

158
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,080
Let me love you.

159
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
It's not fair to you.

160
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,159
I can't give you anything now.

161
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,919
I can't give you anything.

162
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,679
I want nothing.

163
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm not asking to be with you forever.

164
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,159
Let me love you.

165
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,120
Be it one day, one month,

166
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,759
half a year, or a year.

167
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,320
I won't tell anyone.

168
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,240
Qian Qian, don't be childish.

169
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,600
What do you want?

170
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,399
I'm old and sick.

171
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,639
What do you want?

172
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,279
I'm doing this for me.

173
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,279
I only want...

174
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,679
to be madly in love...

175
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,799
with someone I love...

176
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,159
for once in my life.

177
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,279
Otherwise,

178
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,320
I'd rather die.

179
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,320
I believe...

180
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,879
you'll find a better man.

181
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,919
He will be better than me in every way.

182
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,039
You will love him with all your heart and soul.

183
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,159
You still have a long way to go.

184
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,480
Cherish your youth.

185
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,080
Love someone who is better than me with all your heart.

186
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,879
Don't waste your time on someone like me.

187
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,320
It's meaningless.

188
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,559
How do you know?

189
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,399
What if I can't?

190
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,519
What if I meet a person...

191
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,879
who is too afraid to love...

192
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,679
just like you?

193
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,240
No.

194
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm sure you will meet someone better.

195
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,919
I know that.

196
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,240
I...

197
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,890
I...

198
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,650
I...

199
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,519
Let me ask you one last thing.

200
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,759
Please be honest with me.

201
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,799
Go ahead.

202
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,839
If...

203
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,279
If you...

204
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,079
give up on me today,

205
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,119
will you regret it in the future?

206
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Yes.

207
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,680
I'll regret it.

208
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,170
I'll be extremely upset.

209
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,559
These are our dining rooms.

210
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,680
It's all yours.

211
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,359
Our store has the best feng shui.

212
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,759
I've never lost a single penny in the course of the business.

213
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,410
I think it's okay.

214
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,559
This is a nice yard.

215
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,170
It's spacious.

216
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,170
It's not bad.

217
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,480
(Hai Xing, we are leaving. Be good. From Mr. Tian)

218
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,890
The way this bar was designed is also quite modern.

219
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,170
Sir.

220
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,319
Sir.

221
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,599
Can you show us the kitchen?

222
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,839
All right.

223
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,079
Let's go.

224
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,559
This kitchen...

225
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,759
is not big.

226
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,759
It's not that big, but it's quite practical.

227
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,039
Nothing can go wrong when you cook and serve the food.

228
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,440
Most importantly, fire prevention and hygiene are top-notch.

229
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,519
There was no problem at all during the examination.

230
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,519
Don't worry.

231
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,000
It seems that you have put in a lot of effort in this restaurant.

232
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,039
The layout is quite reasonable.

233
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,890
Yes. Look at this.

234
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,890
It's handy.

235
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,319
Yes, that's right.

236
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,480
This little girl...

237
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,680
That's fine. She is our staff.

238
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,650
It has been a while.

239
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,839
She has grown attached to this place.

240
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,039
The moment she knew that the restaurant was for sale,

241
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,920
she got upset.

242
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,039
Your staff is so attached to the restaurant.

243
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
That means you're a good boss.

244
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,000
All right. Let's go upstairs.

245
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,039
Okay. You have a good employee.

246
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,119
Very well.

247
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,359
The second floor is a guest house.

248
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,680
There are four rooms.

249
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,890
Take a look.

250
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,759
It can hold up to eight people.

251
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,839
It's not bad.

252
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,119
It can fit eight people.

253
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,799
That's why it's known as Xing and Eight Guests.

254
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,079
Yes.

255
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,799
It's a nice house.

256
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,519
Why are you selling it?

257
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,799
That's right.

258
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,200
It has been years.

259
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,599
After being here for so long,

260
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,480
I get bored.

261
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,519
I want to stay somewhere else.

262
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
I don't understand...

263
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,160
young people like you.

264
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
That's right.

265
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,119
Sir!

266
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,599
Who are you?

267
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,960
From now on, Xing and Eight Guests will be your home.

268
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,480
From now on, Xing and Eight Guests will be your battlefield.

269
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,839
Okay, sir.

270
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,759
Hello?

271
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,960
Hou Jue.

272
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Our boss is selling off Xing and Eight Guests.

273
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,799
What's wrong with him lately?

274
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,279
Did something happen to him?

275
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,720
He's fine.

276
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,119
He was happy a while ago.

277
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,519
Then...

278
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,160
two men in black from your company came looking for him.

279
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,440
Later on, an old man...

280
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,200
who looks like he has a lot of money visited him too.

281
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,799
I heard him call him Mr. Hou.

282
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,240
Hou Jue, could that be...

283
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,000
Could that be...

284
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,559
What are you saying? Hello?

285
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,759
Mr. Hou.

286
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,480
Mr. Hou.

287
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,119
I brought the contract.

288
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,200
Have a look.

289
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,759
If there's no problem,

290
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,119
let's sign the contract today.

291
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,160
We will renovate the place and change that sign.

292
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
No problem.

293
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,079
- And then... - Let me tell you. The bed...

294
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,079
- The bed is small. - Let's change it to a bigger one.

295
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,240
- We'll change the bed. - Yes.

296
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,400
Let's change all the desks and chairs at the balcony.

297
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,759
That's fine. He has some sense of style.

298
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,319
I'm sorry.

299
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm not selling the store.

300
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,319
Are you kidding me?

301
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,200
How could you do this?

302
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,440
Didn't we agree?

303
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
Are you serious?

304
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,559
I'm sorry. I'm not going to sell it.

305
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm really sorry.

306
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,680
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
You wasted our time.

308
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,240
- I'm really sorry. - This is ridiculous.

309
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,680
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

310
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,759
I'm really sorry.

311
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
I'm sorry.

312
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,519
Boss.

313
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,599
Why did the two customers leave so angrily?

314
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,839
Is this store not for sale anymore?

315
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,880
Yes.

316
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,519
- Really? - Yes, it's your fault.

317
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,119
You cry every day.

318
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,240
I can't talk to anyone because you're crying.

319
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,160
Well...

320
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,799
Have Mr. Tian and the others found a new job?

321
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,960
- No. - Go get them back for me.

322
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,880
Sure.

323
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,000
Bring your right foot up.

324
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,160
Your right hand holds the back of your foot from the inside.

325
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,440
Inhale.

326
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,559
Raise your left hand.

327
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,640
Breathe out.

328
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
Bring your left hand forward.

329
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,400
Push your right foot back.

330
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,839
Make sure you keep your balance.

331
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,519
Keep breathing.

332
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,160
You scared me.

333
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,599
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

334
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,799
What's wrong? What is it?

335
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,680
It was Hai Xing, wasn't it?

336
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,440
What do you mean?

337
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,359
Hai Xing stole the bidding proposal.

338
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,200
Ma Yong did it.

339
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,119
There was no way he could have stolen it himself.

340
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,400
And he wasn't on the security camera.

341
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,200
Hou Jue.

342
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,839
Ma Yong was arrested.

343
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,400
We lost the company's bidding.

344
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,839
There's no point in thinking about that now.

345
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,039
If we didn't lose the bidding...

346
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,839
and Bao Xiao Han didn't choose to leave the company,

347
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,480
we wouldn't have lost the bidding.

348
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,880
There's no "if".

349
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,079
Everything seemed like a coincidence,

350
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,079
but everything happens for a reason.

351
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,799
I'm happy that I lost.

352
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,319
You've earned it with pride.

353
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,119
Isn't that enough?

354
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,400
I just stepped down from the throne.

355
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,119
I just want a carefree life for a few days.

356
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,200
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

357
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,960
I don't understand.

358
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,680
Why did Hai Xing do that?

359
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
He's still young.

360
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,920
Youngsters tend to make mistakes.

361
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,200
Didn't you make mistakes too?

362
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,640
It could be either a moment of negligence...

363
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,240
or he was blinded by money.

364
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,039
You've forgiven him, right?

365
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
Hou Jue.

366
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,680
In life,

367
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,599
not many people have real friends.

368
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,240
I think Hai Xing is your real friend.

369
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:33,440
Always choose to forgive others when the situation allows.

370
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,880
All right?

371
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,319
Dad, it's exactly because Hai Xing is my real friend...

372
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,559
and I treat him like a brother...

373
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,400
that I can't forgive him.

374
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,039
Keep exercising. I'm leaving.

375
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Hou Jue.

376
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,720
Hou Jue.

377
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,720
You're here, Hou Jue.

378
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,160
Where's Hai Xing?

379
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,720
He's in the kitchen.

380
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,839
I'll get him for you.

381
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:49,720
(Xing and Eight Guests)

382
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,839
What does it mean to be best friends?

383
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,880
Would your best friend stab you in the back?

384
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,759
Let's talk upstairs.

385
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Do your thing.

386
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,079
I knew this was going to blow up sooner or later.

387
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,559
That's good too.

388
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
You have no idea what I have gone through.

389
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,759
Ma Yong approached you, didn't he?

390
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes.

391
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,960
A while ago,

392
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,680
I fell in love with Qian Qian.

393
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,759
She was way out of my league.

394
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,960
The feeling was not mutual.

395
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,759
A rich fellow gave her a villa and a nice car.

396
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,200
You knew that.

397
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,839
So I didn't have a choice.

398
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,240
I decided to keep it to myself.

399
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,279
After that fellow had a hard time pursuing her,

400
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,160
he didn't cherish her and abandoned her.

401
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,240
I couldn't just sit back and watch. I had to get back at him, right?

402
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,079
What does that have to do with me?

403
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,359
You can just get back at him. Why did you do that to me?

404
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,839
I...

405
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,839
What? Are you crazy?

406
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,119
Yes, something is wrong with me.

407
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,119
I went crazy.

408
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,880
I needed the money.

409
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,720
I needed to prove to Qian Qian. that I could support her.

410
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,880
That was why I did that.

411
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,680
I'm a psycho. I went crazy.

412
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,839
Are you happy now?

413
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,119
Yes.

414
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,480
Because of that,

415
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,160
do you know how much damage you've caused?

416
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,039
You almost ruined the future...

417
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,680
of an excellent designer named Bao Xiao Han.

418
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,960
My dad lost the bid.

419
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
He had a heart attack.

420
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,680
Zhirong Construction almost went bankrupt.

421
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
I'm sorry.

422
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,319
For what?

423
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
Stop pretending.

424
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,880
What were you thinking when you took the money?

425
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,119
I trusted you the most.

426
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,599
I came here today...

427
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,039
with the hope to hear that you didn't do it.

428
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,920
I can't believe that it's you.

429
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,240
I really can't accept that my best friend set me up.

430
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Where's your conscience?

431
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,160
Was it eaten by a dog?

432
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,519
Yes, my conscience was eaten up by a dog.

433
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,720
You're right.

434
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,599
I never asked you to forgive me.

435
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,839
You can hit me if you want.

436
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,799
I don't think you and I will be friends anymore.

437
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,039
I don't care if we're no longer friends.

438
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,480
I did it on purpose.

439
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
What did you say?

440
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,640
I'm saying...

441
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,160
I wasn't good enough to be your friend in the first place.

442
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,240
Why are you being so arrogant?

443
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,559
Yes, I'm being arrogant with you.

444
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,279
It's about time that I acted up.

445
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,319
I'm telling you now.

446
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,960
Listen carefully.

447
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,359
We're different.

448
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,519
You'll never understand...

449
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,400
people at my level.

450
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,640
You grew up with a silver spoon in your mouth.

451
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,599
I grew up in a welfare institute.

452
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,279
You always told me your dad was driving you to a dead end.

453
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,519
I have always been stuck at a dead end.

454
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,799
I never came out.

455
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,319
Do you really think of me as a friend?

456
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,519
I don't think so.

457
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,599
I was only your sidekick.

458
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,559
I was just an extra.

459
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,480
During a rescue mission,

460
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,920
you were always at the front while I pulled the rope for you.

461
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,160
During car racing,

462
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,240
when you were cheering over there,

463
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,880
I was clapping for you at the back.

464
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,480
Have you ever complimented me?

465
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
Shut up.

466
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Just once.

467
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,839
Who do you think you are?

468
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,119
Why should I listen to you?

469
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,440
Why should I follow your instructions,

470
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,359
Young Master Hou Jue?

471
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm telling you. Even you don't know the truth.

472
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,319
When you behave like the higher-up...

473
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,720
and talk down to me,

474
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
you're so irritating.

475
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,039
It's so annoying.

476
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,359
We should have never met.

477
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,759
- Shut up. - I said I never should've met you.

478
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,799
Stay away from me. Scram.

479
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,639
Will you two stop fighting?

480
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,809
Stop it.

481
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,329
Stop it, you two.

482
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:27,329
Can you stop fighting?

483
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,840
Stop it!

484
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,880
Hai Xing.

485
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,599
Stop fighting, both of you!

486
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:44,960
I'm sorry, Dolly.

487
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,679
Stop hitting Hai Xing.

488
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,159
Boss.

489
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,480
Boss, are you all right?

490
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,809
- Are you okay? - Does it hurt?

491
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,440
Where does it hurt?

492
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,440
Boss.

493
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,199
The one who stabbed me in the back is my best friend.

494
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,480
I can't believe this.

495
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,960
Did he say why?

496
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,239
He said it was because of Qian Qian.

497
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,880
Didn't Qian Qian say that she was dating a business owner?

498
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,519
Hai Xing felt it was unfair.

499
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,039
That was why he did that.

500
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,679
Ma Yong used him to steal the documents.

501
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,519
That doesn't make any sense.

502
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:33,880
What doesn't make sense?

503
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,400
He sacrificed our friendship for the benefit.

504
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,719
But I don't think Hai Xing is that kind of person.

505
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,809
When you were desperate,

506
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,719
he took you in and didn't want anything in return.

507
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,360
Why did he do that?

508
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,039
I don't think he's that kind of person either.

509
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,440
But he did it.

510
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,679
He already did.

511
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Am I right?

512
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,559
Does Mr. Hou know about this?

513
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:57,769
Yes.

514
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,519
I think he went to see him.

515
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,599
Did he tell you?

516
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,360
How?

517
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,000
My dad didn't have the heart to tell me the truth.

518
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,519
He must have been worried that I would be sad.

519
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:17,719
I think Qian Qian's lover...

520
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:19,960
is your dad.

521
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,519
That explains a lot.

522
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:24,199
Stop messing around. I'm serious.

523
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,119
I'm not kidding.

524
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,769
Qian Qian told me before...

525
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,719
that she liked someone much older than her.

526
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,920
That person has a son and he is a successful businessman.

527
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,639
She didn't disclose anything else.

528
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,679
It's not like her.

529
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,199
Unless...

530
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,159
she doesn't want me to know who that person is.

531
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,880
No...

532
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,480
Then...

533
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,440
Qian Qian and my dad...

534
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,599
Nothing is impossible.

535
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,559
So the porridge...

536
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,199
was from Qian Qian?

537
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,840
- It's possible. - She called my dad old man?

538
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,199
It could be a nickname she gave your dad.

539
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,599
No, she and my dad...

540
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,599
But if that's not the case, then nothing else makes sense.

541
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,639
Think about it.

542
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,400
So they knew about it since the beginning,

543
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:22,480
but no one told me.

544
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,289
Hai Xing didn't tell me either.

545
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,599
Hai Xing didn't know how to tell you.

546
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,840
Qian Qian didn't want you to know.

547
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,639
Your dad couldn't tell you.

548
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,329
That was why they kept quiet.

549
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,119
Why couldn't they tell me?

550
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,119
Look...

551
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,960
Why couldn't they tell me?

552
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,719
I'm even more upset now.

553
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:52,360
It's my dad.

554
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,809
Hello, Dad.

555
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,329
I'm with Hai Xing.

556
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,559
It's okay.

557
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,119
I think it's a misunderstanding.

558
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:06,289
Don't worry.

559
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,880
I'm going out tonight.

560
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm not going back.

561
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Bye.

562
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,239
It's horrible.

563
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,289
If they get married,

564
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:22,079
how should I address Qian Qian?

565
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,199
How should you address my dad?

566
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,559
How should Qian Qian address me?

567
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,769
How should you address Qian Qian?

568
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,360
You're so annoying.

569
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,679
That's weird.

570
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,239
Come in.

571
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,239
Is this where you peek at me?

572
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,880
That's right.

573
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,960
Many things are different from what they appear to be.

574
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,079
Maybe that's life.

575
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,519
Behind every window,

576
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,199
happiness looks the same,

577
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,480
but sadness is different for each person.

578
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:34,769
Then tell me.

579
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,079
If you're with the one you love,

580
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,599
would you feel happy even if you're drowning in sadness?

581
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,519
I don't know.

582
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,840
It's not within my knowledge.

583
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,360
I'm telling you.

584
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,199
In life,

585
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,559
we're going to meet at least 2.9 million people.

586
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,480
So the probability for two persons to meet each other...

587
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,159
is 0.049 percent.

588
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,639
It's really a fat chance.

589
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,159
I must have used up all my luck...

590
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,920
to have met you in this life.

591
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,239
You have to compensate me.

592
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,960
How?

593
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,809
Stay with me.

594
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,719
Always stay with me.

595
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,809
Always.

596
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,769
It's almost 50 yuan.

597
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,199
I can buy over 10 bottles of regular soy sauce at this price.

598
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,719
Sir, that's not it. Think about it.

599
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,639
A bottle of soy sauce can last up to 3 to 4 months.

600
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,679
You only spend a little extra every day...

601
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,559
to improve your quality of life.

602
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,159
You sure have a way with words.

603
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,559
Even if I fell into a bowl of soy sauce,

604
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,960
my living standard wouldn't improve that much.

605
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:45,360
Of course not.

606
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,679
Find the cheapest one you can find here.

607
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:51,199
All the soy sauces are here.

608
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,679
Why don't you look around?

609
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,960
- Miss, are you all right? - Hold on.

610
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,159
- She's pregnant. - I had nothing to do with it.

611
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,639
I didn't do anything.

612
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,079
Please help me, ma'am.

613
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,480
It's not my fault.

614
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,719
Please help me.

615
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,920
This is...

616
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,639
Help me.

617
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,199
Isn't this Da Peng's wife?

618
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,639
- Xue Mei. - Sir.

619
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,239
Sir, do you know her?

620
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,329
She had already fallen when I got here.

621
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,480
- It's really not my fault. - Mr. Wu, my stomach hurts.

622
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:20,920
Is there a doctor here?

623
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,329
Call the ambulance now!
