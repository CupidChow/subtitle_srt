- Something's happening here! - Something's happening.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,280
- Something is going on over there! - Shi Yi, I'm moving on.

33
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,599
Follow the majority and meet up with me later.

34
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,560
We are walking around cluelessly.

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
Shi Ai Shan!

36
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,759

Shi Ai Shan!

40
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,759
Why are they all so fast?

41
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,439
Shi Ai Shan!

42
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,199
I have to walk back.

43
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,719
This doesn't look like it.

44
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Is this the way?

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,879
It's this way.

46
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Captain!

47
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,319
Captain!

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,170
Is anyone there?

49
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,639
Shi Ai Shan!

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,319
Shi Ai Shan!

51
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,439
Shi Ai Shan!

52
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,050
Attention, team.

53
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,000
It's too foggy.

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,399
For safety reasons,

55
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,759
everyone has to stand by.

56
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,199
Stop searching.

57
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,680
- Got it. - Got it.

58
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,759
Captain, Hou Jue is missing.

59
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,399
That punk.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,050
He never obeys orders.

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,399
I should have fired him sooner.

62
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,000
- Li. - Yes.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,680
Grab your gear and come with me to find Hou Jue.

64
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,360
- Okay. - Everyone else, stand by.

65
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll go.

66
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,959
Don't worry, I'm a trained professional.

67
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,120
Captain, let her come with me.

68
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,199
She was trying to save me.

69
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,610
That's why she lost Hou Jue.

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,120
It's foggy. We need you to be here.

71
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,360
Okay.

72
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,199
If you find him,

73
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,199
stay where you are if it's still foggy.

74
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,519
- Don't go anywhere. - Yes.

75
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,079
- You can use my equipment. - Okay.

76
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,040
Be careful. Call if you find anything.

77
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Yes.

78
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,839
Let's go.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Be safe.

80
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,319
Okay.

81
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,519
Hou Jue!

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800
Hou Jue!

83
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,439
Captain.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,839
Is anyone there?

85
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,000
Hou Jue!

86
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,000
Did you hear that?

87
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,800
The birds got scared.

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,920
The birds are in the west region of Zone C.

89
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,279
Someone must be there.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,720
Hou Jue has just disappeared on this road.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,079
We'll follow the trail.

92
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,439
Watch your step. We may slide down anywhere.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,079
Okay.

94
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,120
Let's go.

95
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,319
Be careful.

96
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,920
Hou Jue!

97
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,000
Captain!

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,839
Is anyone there?

99
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,399
Hou Jue!

100
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,879
Captain!

101
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,079
Hou Jue!

102
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,319
Rescue Command.

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,279
We heard Hou Jue screaming for help at the western region of Zone C.

104
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,519
Please come quickly.

105
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,680
Is anyone there?

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Hou Jue!

107
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,759
Hurry up. We found someone.

108
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,639
Hurry up.

109
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,480
There are skid marks here.

110
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,800
Hou Jue.

111
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
Are you okay?

112
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
Come and help me!

113
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,920
Quick! Throw him the rope!

114
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,879
Hou Jue, are you all right?

115
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
Hurry up and throw me a rope.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
I got the rope.

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Slowly.

118
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,959
Okay.

119
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,279
Hold on.

120
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,680
Shine downward.

121
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,879
Shine the flashlight downward.

122
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,480
Someone is down here.

123
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,519
There's someone down there.

124
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,799
He misses his mom.

125
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,759
Leave him alone.

126
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,559
It will pass.

127
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,330
Shi Yi, maybe you can tell...

128
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,450
that the relationship between Mr. Hou Junior and his dad...

129
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,450
has always been a little awkward.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,919
This is related to his mom's death.

131
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,720
He always felt his dad was to be blamed...

132
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,840
for his mom's death.

133
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,210
Why?

134
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,720
He always thinks that...

135
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,720
his dad wasn't good enough to his mom...

136
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,759
and that he didn't listen to his mom.

137
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,320
That's why his mom lost her temper...

138
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,320
and was met with an accident as she stormed out.

139
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,600
For a while,

140
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,679
his dad was really busy.

141
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,360
His mom had no company.

142
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,279
Hence, she was emotionally unstable.

143
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,759
That's why...

144
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,320
his mom was especially lonely.

145
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
What did his mom work as?

146
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,639
Before his mom got married,

147
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,200
she played violin in an orchestra.

148
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,919
After getting married,

149
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,240
she stopped working...

150
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,039
and became a full-time homemaker.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,919
But his mom was a really good person.

152
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,200
And she was pretty.

153
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,720
She was nice to me too.

154
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,000
I remember her kindness.

155
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,320
So after the accident,

156
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I thought...

157
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,559
it's such a pity...

158
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,919
that the small boy lost his mom at such a young age.

159
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,600
So I stayed in the family...

160
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,240
and took care of him since.

161
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,200
Since young,

162
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,559
whenever he misses his mom,

163
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,879
he will sit right there.

164
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,919
He won't talk to anyone.

165
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,879
Seriously, I feel bad for him.

166
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Ms. Zhang.

167
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,279
I'll go and check on him.

168
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,480
- You... - Don't worry, it's okay.

169
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,559
Come in.

170
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,320
Have some hot chocolate.

171
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,759
Thank you.

172
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,960
Come, sit down.

173
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
Thank you.

174
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,240
Here's a gift.

175
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,960
This is such an old car.

176
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,879
Where did you get this?

177
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,440
A friend gave it to me as a gift when I was young.

178
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,600
I still remember that person.

179
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,879
He was short and skinny.

180
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,720
He was always bullied in class.

181
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,639
I felt bad for him, so I protected him.

182
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,159
I was on the sports team.

183
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,919
Guys didn't even dare to mess with me.

184
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Then my parents got divorced.

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,240
My mom decided to send me to a professional sports team.

186
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,759
Hence, I went to boarding school.

187
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,000
On the last day of school,

188
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,240
the boy came to me and said,

189
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,120
I'm his best friend.

190
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,879
He gave me a present...

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,039
which was this car.

192
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,360
His family was very poor.

193
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,919
I knew that it was his most precious thing.

194
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,639
And then we lost contact.

195
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,399
We haven't seen each other all these years.

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,279
But I always remember...

197
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,799
that there was someone...

198
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
who was willing to give me the best things in life.

199
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,759
I'll never forget...

200
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,519
the affection.

201
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,879
Whenever I'm sad,

202
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,159
I take it out to have a look.

203
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,240
It makes me feel warm...

204
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,159
and gives me strength.

205
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,080
I don't know what to say.

206
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
So...

207
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,639
You can have it.

208
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,879
I hope it gives you strength too.

209
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,120
Okay.

210
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
As I'm holding it now,

211
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,440
I feel like...

212
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm full of power.

213
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Go!

214
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Shi Yi.

215
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,679
I'll go with you.

216
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
You're up early.

217
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,759
You look lethargic.

218
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,039
You didn't get much sleep, did you?

219
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,919
I woke up early to exercise with you.

220
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Let's go.

221
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Let's go.

222
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,440
People jog when the weather is good.

223
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
Why are you out in the rain?

224
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,639
It doesn't matter if the weather is good or bad.

225
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,600
Let alone raining,

226
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,879
I have to run even if it's raining knives.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,960
No wonder you are unbeatable...

228
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,240
and invulnerable.

229
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,600
I understand what you mean.

230
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,679
Actually,

231
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,240
Hou Jue treats me quite well.

232
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,080
I really didn't want to lie to him.

233
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,639
But I never thought...

234
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,919
that female bodyguard...

235
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,840
would do that to me so soon.

236
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,600
Okay, let's do what you said.

237
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,399
Let me put it this way.

238
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,799
With my intelligence,

239
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
she's like an idiot.

240
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,839
Don't go easy on them.

241
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,799
If you're weak-hearted to idiots,

242
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,680
you're dumber than them.

243
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,359
Do you want to be a fool?

244
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,839
Am I right?

245
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,119
That makes sense.

246
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,000
Should I ask Hou Jue to dinner now?

247
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,519
Let me think about it.

248
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,890
This is how you do it.

249
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,960
What on earth is that?

250
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,319
Is it made from diamond?

251
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,890
Hello, sir.

252
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,000
How can I help you?

253
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,079
Well...

254
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,240
A friend of mine is getting married.

255
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,759
And I want to pick out a wedding gift for them.

256
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,079
Excuse me.

257
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,279
These four cups are a set, right?

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Yes, the entire set is 818 yuan.

259
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,279
That's right.

260
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,410
Good.

261
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,720
This set is nice.

262
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
It's of good quality too.

263
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,599
You have good taste.

264
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,799
The sales of this set...

265
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,359
- is exceptionally great. - Is it?

266
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
But...

267
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,519
Isn't "cups" a homonym for "tragedy"?

268
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,680
Well...

269
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,680
That's right. You're right.

270
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,440
I forgot about that.

271
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,650
Thank you.

272
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,359
What would you recommend?

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,720
If it's meant to be a wedding gift,

274
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,170
I recommend this one.

275
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,319
Here, look.

276
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,119
It's a limited edition.

277
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,839
Look how meaningful it is.

278
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,119
This swan represents the groom...

279
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,000
and this represents a bride.

280
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Very soon,

281
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,170
they will also have a cute little baby.

282
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,799
This one has a good meaning.

283
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,559
How much is it?

284
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,039
It's 5,199 yuan after the discount.

285
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,240
Five...

286
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,170
It's a little expensive.

287
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Is there a discount?

288
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,759
Sir, it's 5,199 yuan.

289
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,650
It gives a blessing that the marriage lasts long.

290
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,839
Since it is a wedding gift for a friend,

291
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
not only should it be classy,

292
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,359
it also should be lucky.

293
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,960
The number 5,199...

294
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,240
is perfect.

295
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,720
We're down to the last one.

296
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,440
It has a limited-edition license.

297
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,240
It has high value as a collectible.

298
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,079
Sure, I'll take one.

299
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,240
Come in.

300
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,519
Mr. Hou, Bao Xiao Han is here to see you.

301
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,410
Bao Xiao Han?

302
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,799
Come on, Xiao Han.

303
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,720
Mr. Hou, are you busy?

304
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,079
What is it?

305
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,119
Congratulations.

306
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,440
I have something for you.

307
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I hope you'll like it.

308
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,680
Why are you suddenly thinking of giving me this?

309
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,559
It's a wedding gift for Mr. Hou Junior.

310
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:11,890
I appreciate the thought.

311
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,079
But speaking about marriage,

312
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,650
I think it's still too early.

313
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,359
Excuse me, Mr. Hou.

314
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,440
Maybe I don't get it.

315
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,680
Should I pass the present...

316
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,039
to Mr. Hou Junior...

317
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,799
at his wedding in two days?

318
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,170
In two days?

319
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,559
What do you mean? You...

320
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,200
You are confusing me now.

321
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,359
Isn't Mr. Hou Junior getting married in two days?

322
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,839
Who told you that?

323
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,079
I have a good friend.

324
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,799
He works as a manager at a film studio.

325
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,200
He posted a photo on social media.

326
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
He said that a celebrity came to take wedding photos.

327
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,759
When I clicked on it,

328
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
I realized the groom was Mr. Hou Junior.

329
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,160
Could it be a joke between young people?

330
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,000
They always edit their photos.

331
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
No.

332
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,799
Take a look.

333
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
Thank you for the gift.

334
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,160
You should get back to work.

335
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,480
- I'll get going then. - Okay, thank you.

336
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,519
Congratulations.

337
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,480
Tell Hou Jue to come to my office now.

338
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Now!

339
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
That punk.

340
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Mr. Hou asked you to go over.

341
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Dad, were you looking for me?

342
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,000
So you do know that I'm your dad.

343
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,200
Marriage is a big deal.

344
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,319
How could you hide that from me?

345
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,480
Who told you?

346
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,759
Who told me?

347
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,599
The wedding present is here.

348
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,319
I heard you took wedding photos too.

349
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,440
Are you still hiding it from me?

350
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,440
No, I'm not hiding it from you. We're getting married.

351
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,359
I know.

352
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,559
Regarding you and Huang Yue,

353
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,240
you have some ideas about me.

354
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,839
It's okay. I'm thankful for you.

355
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,079
I have no comments.

356
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,519
Is that why...

357
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,920
you got someone worse than Huang Yue to come against me?

358
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,359
What is she after, if not for money?

359
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,559
It's probably because of my money.

360
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,319
But I'm after her because of her beauty, right?

361
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,720
It's a win-win situation.

362
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,440
Marriage is not a big deal.

363
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,079
Listen.

364
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,559
I will never let you do that.

365
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,279
Dad, why do you...

366
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,640
keep meddling in my marriage?

367
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,599
Do you want to find one yourself?

368
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,799
Have you been single for too long?

369
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,079
It's okay, Dad, just look for one.

370
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,559
I won't interfere.

371
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,680
Or are you afraid that I'll get married before you?

372
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,319
Well, I can wait.

373
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,000
If it doesn't work out,

374
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,519
we can do it together.

375
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
How dare you!

376
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,119
Listen, as the only successor of the Hou family,

377
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,680
your business is the Hou family's business.

378
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,440
I will never allow you to act recklessly.

379
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,480
Dad, do you know that's illegal?

380
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,599
The marriage law is very clear.

381
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,440
If I want to get married,

382
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,960
I have the final say...

383
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,079
on who, when, and how I get married.

384
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,839
No one else can interfere.

385
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,680
You think you have the final say, right?

386
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,720
But I have your household register.

387
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,519
How are you going to register your marriage?

388
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,799
Dad, I've thought it through.

389
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,119
We are not going to register our marriage.

390
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,079
We will have a wedding first.

391
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
We will make it as big as possible.

392
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,440
I will invite all my family and friends.

393
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,240
I'll send you the invitation, Dad.

394
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,799
I'm leaving.

395
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,599
I can't believe I spoiled him like this.

396
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:22,880
He is killing me.

397
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:32,720
Hou Jue, I was wrong.

398
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,240
Please reply to my text messages.

399
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,079
I have a question.

400
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
Don't worry.

401
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,000
The show won't be aired.

402
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,160
Don't worry.

403
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,400
I'm already fired.

404
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,839
All right, I have a question.

405
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,119
I deserved to be fired!

406
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,599
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied.

407
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,480
That day,

408
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,799
when you gave me that necklace at the beach,

409
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,000
I got too excited.

410
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
I couldn't even...

411
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,680
I couldn't even imagine that it was real.

412
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So I exaggerated.

413
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,039
I told all of them...

414
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,599
that you're my fiancé.

415
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,119
You already proposed to me.

416
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,720
And the director believed it.

417
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,240
He said he wanted to shoot an extra episode for me.

418
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,680
Hou Jue.

419
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,519
Do you know?

420
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,400
When the director said that,

421
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
the girls were so jealous of me.

422
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
All my life,

423
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,640
I've never felt so valued before.

424
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,359
But I've learned my lesson.

425
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,039
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
All right, don't cry.

427
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,279
Don't cry. Listen to me.

428
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,720
We can put this behind us.

429
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,599
Learn your lesson, okay?

430
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,680
The most important thing is to be honest.

431
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,319
Don't do silly things like that.

432
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,400
It's no use.

433
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,000
Listen to me.

434
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,599
I still prefer the old you who used to be innocent...

435
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
and adorable.

436
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,480
Just let it be.

437
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,079
It's over. Don't mention it again.

438
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,880
Then give me a chance.

439
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,720
Can I treat you to a meal?

440
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,279
I want to apologize to you in person.

441
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,799
Didn't we agree to move on?

442
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,640
Okay, send me the address.

443
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,799
I have something to ask you as well.

444
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,599
I have something to ask you as well.

445
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Who is it?

446
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
When did you get here?

447
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,359
Bye.

448
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,359
What's wrong? Are you okay?

449
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,079
I have a friend.

450
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,519
She met a horrible man.

451
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:27,839
A horrible man?

452
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,319
I have a friend who has met a horrible guy too.

453
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,720
The thing is,

454
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,440
that jerk has a horrible friend.

455
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,400
- What did you say? - A horrible friend.

456
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,319
It means a friend who is terrible.

457
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,400
And the friend is a woman.

458
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,319
I learned a new word today.

459
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,599
What did they do?

460
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:45,880
The horrible friend...

461
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,160
is jealous of my friend.

462
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,839
She told that jerk that my friend is promiscuous.

463
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,079
More importantly, that jerk believed it.

464
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,759
He wants to break up with my friend.

465
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,720
Is your friend really promiscuous?

466
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,240
Of course she is not.

467
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,640
How can I be friends with her if she's so promiscuous?

468
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,400
She's like me.

469
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,799
She has never misbehaved before.

470
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,119
It's hard to make a living and sustain oneself.

471
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,359
Her biggest flaw...

472
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,720
is that she's too pretty.

473
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,000
People are jealous of her.

474
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,599
I like mingling...

475
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,839
with ambitious girls like you guys.

476
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,039
Try to comfort her.

477
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,359
Of course, I will.

478
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,000
But you have a best friend too.

479
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,839
Since when? I don't have a best friend.

480
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Do you mean Hai Xing?

481
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,039
He would never talk badly about anyone.

482
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Were you talking about her?

483
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,559
It's more impossible for her. She won't even talk.

484
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,839
Stop badmouthing.

485
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,640
But she's with you every day.

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,359
I'm still a little scared.

487
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,319
I feel like I need to bond with her.

488
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,079
Ms. Shi Yi.

489
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,880
Do you want to join us?

490
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,440
No, thank you.

491
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,960
You know what?

492
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,799
- We were just talking about how... - Lu Lu.

493
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,559
That's her job.

494
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,880
Why aren't you wearing the necklace I bought you?

495
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,319
Do you not like it?

496
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,680
I love it so much.

497
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,960
It's too precious to wear.

498
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,160
Look, there it is.

499
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,559
I don't want to break it.

500
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,400
I don't dare to leave it at home.

501
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,079
I'm afraid that someone will steal it.

502
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,480
So I keep it in my handbag every day...

503
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,759
and bring it with me.

504
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,400
Seeing it puts me at ease.

505
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,359
It's a necklace.

506
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,559
It won't break easily.

507
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,519
Lu Lu, I need to go to the restroom.

508
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
I'll go too.

509
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,599
I'm going too!

510
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Come on.

511
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,680
The ladies' room is over there.

512
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,079
Ms. Shi Yi, hold this for me.

513
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,359
I can't.

514
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,640
Bill, please.

515
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,759
Has she come out yet?

516
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,559
I know.

517
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,200
All right.

518
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,039
Sure.

519
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,519
Okay.

520
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Yes.

521
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,400
Let's do that.

522
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,079
Where is the necklace?

523
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,880
Lu Lu, let me ask you.

524
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,039
Where's my necklace?

525
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,039
What's wrong?

526
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,200
I lost my necklace.

527
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,200
Wasn't it in the bag?

528
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,839
That's right.

529
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,000
Where is the necklace?

530
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,519
Did you misplace it?

531
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,839
The bag is empty.

532
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,599
I don't know.

533
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,039
- I didn't do anything. - Let me see.

534
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,200
I know.

535
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,480
Manager!

536
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,480
- Why are you yelling? - Waiter! Get your manager here!

537
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,759
- Hurry up! - No. I'm sorry.

538
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,720
Close the door!

539
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,839
No one may enter.

540
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
What are you doing? Why are you shouting?

541
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,680
- Close the door? - I'm looking for a necklace.

542
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,960
Sorry, ma'am.

543
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,519
What happened here?

544
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,480
I lost my necklace.

545
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,599
I showed it to you earlier, right?

546
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,200
Then I went to the restroom.

547
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,960
Before I went to the restroom,

548
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,279
I left the bag with you.

549
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,359
After I came out of the restroom, you returned the bag to me.

550
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,680
When I opened the bag,

551
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,960
I found that the necklace was gone.

552
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,839
Don't talk nonsense. You must have dropped it somewhere.

553
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm not making it up! It's the truth!

554
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,599
- Ma'am, calm down. - How can I not be anxious?

555
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:58,799
That's an expensive necklace.

556
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,440
It's worth tens of thousands of yuan!

557
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,519
Yes, I know.

558
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,519
Since you've lost an item of substantial value,

559
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,279
I'll call the police right away.

560
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,809
Call the police?

561
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,440
Did you drop it somewhere? Look for it.

562
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,880
- Don't create a scene. - I didn't. Call the police.

563
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,639
How about this?

564
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:17,480
Let's go to my office and wait for the police.

565
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,329
Okay, let's go.

566
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,519
Why bother calling the police and making a scene?

567
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,239
Call the police if you want. I'm leaving.

568
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,960
No, you can't go.

569
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,920
Hou Jue, I would let it go if anything else is missing.

570
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,519
But it was a gift from you.

571
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,809
It's so precious.

572
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,159
If you leave now,

573
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,809
she will follow you.

574
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,360
She's our prime suspect.

575
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,400
She can't leave.

576
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,159
Fang Lu, I'm warning you.

577
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,480
You have no proof to accuse me publicly.

578
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,639
I can sue you for defamation.

579
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,079
Everyone, listen up.

580
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,599
Let's wait in my office.

581
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,289
Okay?

582
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:50,719
Don't disturb other customers.

583
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,119
Okay?

584
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,000
This way, please.

585
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,039
Come on.

586
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,400
- Excuse me. - What's going on?

587
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,599
We'll take care of it.

588
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,809
Enjoy your meal.

589
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,119
Thank you.

590
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,289
When was the last time you saw the necklace?

591
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,440
Where was it?

592
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:10,329
It was when we were eating.

593
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,079
I took the necklace out.

594
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,400
I showed it to Hou Jue.

595
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,920
I saw it while we were eating.

596
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,239
But I wonder if she was just being careless...

597
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,440
and dropped it when she took it out.

598
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,400
Someone else might have picked it up.

599
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,329
Did you go straight into the restroom...

600
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,360
or did you go into the restroom...

601
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,400
after giving it to Wu Shi Yi?

602
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,679
Before I went into the restroom,

603
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,960
I gave her the bag.

604
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,289
I suspect it's her.

605
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,199
I'm Hou Jue's security assistant.

606
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,679
Fang Lu did give her bag to me.

607
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,440
But she passed it to me after coming out of the restroom.

608
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:38,920
How long was the process?

609
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,199
- Ms. Shi Yi, hold this for me. - For about 5 to 10 seconds.

610
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,519
Did you touch that bag?

611
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,769
I didn't open it.

612
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,199
I didn't even touch the button.

613
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,239
You may examine the fingerprints.

614
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,159
To avoid suspicion, after I got the bag,

615
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,679
I walked to somewhere with security cameras quickly.

616
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm telling you.

617
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,679
Before the surveillance area,

618
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,960
there's a blind spot.

619
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,079
When you went into the restroom,

620
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,199
did you see anyone there?

621
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,400
I went to the restroom too.

622
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,289
Besides, whether the ladies' room is empty,

623
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:08,360
I have no idea.

624
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,920
Yes, a pregnant woman came out of the restroom.

625
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:13,239
And I noticed that she left very quickly.

626
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,809
I needed to go to the restroom badly.

627
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
I didn't notice.

628
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,599
I guess not.

629
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,000
That's all for today.

630
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,239
If you remember anything, call me anytime.

631
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,119
Thank you.

632
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,599
Can I go now?

633
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,079
Okay, Mr. Zhao. I understand.

634
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,119
What's wrong?

635
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,809
Mr. Zhao received a complaint about me.

636
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,599
He demanded that I be recalled immediately.

637
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,000
Who filed a complaint against you?

638
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,039
Did you make the call?

639
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
It's me.

640
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
No, it's none of your business.

641
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,000
What gives you the right to make this call?

642
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:55,960
I don't know anything else,

643
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,039
but I do know...

644
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,000
that when customers buy a knockoff product,

645
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,519
they can file a complaint.

646
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,119
They can even ask for a refund.

647
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,599
You know I have always been a righteous person.

648
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,039
Unlike some people...

649
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,559
who love stealing small things.

650
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,809
What are you talking about?

651
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,360
What proof do you have...

652
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
to prove that Shi Yi did it?

653
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,400
I didn't say that she did it,

654
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,519
but it's proven...

655
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,639
that she is the prime suspect right now.

656
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,719
Hou Jue, you can't let a person like her...

657
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,920
stay by your side anymore.

658
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,329
It makes me worried.

659
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,079
It's not up to you to decide whether I keep her or not.

660
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,679
You have to believe me.

661
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,639
Everything I do is for your own good.

662
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,199
If you keep her by your side,

663
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,239
you might put yourself in danger.

664
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,519
Shut up.

665
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Shi Yi.

666
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,519
Go and get the car.

667
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,519
Get in.

668
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,159
Come here.

669
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,199
What are you doing?

670
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Why did you pull me so forcefully?

671
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,719
You got so mad at me...

672
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,199
over a female bodyguard.

673
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,239
Do you think it's appropriate?

674
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,400
Fang Lu, let me tell you.

675
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,199
I was going to tell you later,

676
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,519
but you left me with no choice.

677
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,199
Let me ask you.

678
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,000
Are you purposely framing Shi Yi?

679
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,440
You didn't lose your necklace, right?

680
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,079
I lost it. I'm not framing her.

681
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
I...

682
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,519
Fine, I know you won't admit it.

683
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,199
I don't want to hear you admit it either.

684
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
But let me tell you something.

685
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,719
I can't believe...

686
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,559
everything that you say and every expression of yours.

687
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,440
I'm very suspicious, you know?

688
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,769
How could you say that to me?

689
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,119
I'm a victim now.

690
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,599
I'm the one who lost the necklace.

691
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,880
That necklace means a lot to me.

692
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
It's not like you don't know.

693
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,440
I don't care about anything else.

694
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,679
But...

695
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:35,920
But that necklace...

696
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,119
I'll fight her until the end for it.

697
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,360
Why is it even necessary?

698
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,719
Hou Jue, I know you have a soft heart.

699
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,840
That's why I called to complain about her.

700
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:46,440
Anyway, you must not condone this crime.

701
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,769
What do you know?

702
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:50,079
She's still protecting you.

703
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,719
She said you were having a hard time...

704
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,039
and it must be tough on you.

705
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:55,719
Who are you to file a complaint against her?

706
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,480
You're so weird.

707
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,639
Shouldn't you be asking me...

708
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,519
why did she do this to me?

709
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,880
I can't seem to knock any sense into you.

710
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,039
What are you saying?

711
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,719
Shouldn't you be comforting me now?

712
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,679
Hou Jue!

713
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Go to your company.

714
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,289
I'll talk to Mr. Zhao.

715
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,000
Fang Lu has no right...

716
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,559
to file a complaint against you.

717
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,719
You're my bodyguard.

718
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,960
Why is she complaining about you?

719
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:29,719
Our company has rules.

720
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,289
We are not allowed to make any mistake in the course of duty.

721
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,920
What rules are these?

722
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,000
Once we make a mistake, we will be recalled immediately...

723
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:37,519
and await investigation.

724
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:39,719
Do you know something...

725
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,920
and didn't tell me?

726
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:44,329
I'm sorry, your private life...

727
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,559
is not part of my job scope.

728
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:49,840
What do you mean?

729
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,360
Where are you going?

730
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:03,440
Why did you turn around?

731
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,519
Say something.

732
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Why did you come back?

733
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,289
We can't give up on anything that can be a clue.
