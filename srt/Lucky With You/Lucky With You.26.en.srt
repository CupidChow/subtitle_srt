00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,079
(Episode 26)

4
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,159
How is it?

5
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,280
It's delicious.

6
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
Next time,

7
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,959
when you want to eat,

8
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,120
you can come anytime.

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,079
I'll cook anything you want. You can make yourself at home.

10
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,599
- I'll pay you. - Don't say that.

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,239
Doesn't it hurt our friendship?

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,599
I don't even want to break it.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's okay.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,079
You can eat it with some garlic.

15
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,799
I'm telling you, if you add garlic to this rice,

16
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,840
it will be incomparable.

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
- Garlic? - Garlic.

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,359
I'll get it. Dolly.

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,919
Don't stay there.

20
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,090
Go get some garlic. Go.

21
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,090
Go!

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Go.

23
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,840
You're like a boss.

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,120
You talk like a real man to your employee.

25
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,639
I talk like a real man to everyone.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,639
Speaking of eating garlic,

27
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,810
why do we do it?

28
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,000
There's an old saying.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,879
"You basically eat nothing if you don't have any garlic."

30
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,599
The temper of your employee...

31
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,090
is pretty garlic-like.

32
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,240
She has been dealing with family affairs, I think.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,199
Let me peel the garlic for you.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,719
- No, I'm good. - No.

35
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,240
It's fresh garlic.

36
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,199
I don't eat garlic. Don't peel it for me.

37
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,360
- It's okay. - I don't eat garlic.

38
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,280
I told you I don't eat garlic.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Okay.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,479
Okay.

41
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,680
Thank you.

42
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,560
Do you want anything else?

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,199
Can I have more chili?

44
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,759
Okay. Dolly.

45
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,560
I'll get it for you.

46
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,159
Our cook is from Chengdu.

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,240
His chili sauce is really good.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,159
I'll get it for you. Half a minute.

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,639
Check, please!

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
Twenty-five yuan.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,280
Keep the change.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,479
Keep the change?

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,879
As if you're rich.

54
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,520
What a waste of food.

55
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
She didn't finish it at all.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,520
Here comes the chili sauce!

57
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,759
Where is she? In the toilet?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
She left.

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,800
Did you talk nonsense?

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,959
What nonsense?

61
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,920
She asked me how much. I said 25 yuan.

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,079
Then she left.

63
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,439
Should I...

64
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,480
stop her from leaving?

65
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,279
You even let her pay?

66
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,759
This is a business. How can we not let customers pay?

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,199
You're talking back to me.

68
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,959
Look at your attitude.

69
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,519
What did I tell you?

70
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,879
The customer is king.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,639
She's more important than a king, you know?

72
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,079
She's a king? Okay.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,610
If she's a king,

74
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll be the king of the underworld.

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
I am the king of the underworld!

76
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
You want to lose your job, don't you?

77
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,170
Yes, so what?

78
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,439
Get out.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,839
Okay.

80
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,920
Bye.

81
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,050
Bye forever!

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,759
You're throwing a tantrum now?

83
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,759
Five.

84
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,959
Four.

85
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,319
Three.

86
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,639
Two.

87
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
One.

88
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,050
She is really mad.

89
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,959
Sport University?

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
Yes, my alma mater.

91
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,199
What are we doing here?

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
You'll know. Let's go.

93
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
Reminiscing?

94
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,480
You trained here?

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,759
That's right.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,879
I used to train here every day.

97
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,240
Take these.

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,160
Why?

99
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,839
To motivate me?

100
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,639
I don't need to be motivated.

101
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm fine. I'm just tired and need rest.

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
I'm not motivating you.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
Come up and feel it.

104
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
What?

105
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,199
Put them on.

106
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,920
- Come on. - Be gentle.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,160
Have you boxed before?

108
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,079
I'm really good.

109
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,519
Are you okay?

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
I was not ready. Why did you start?

111
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,720
All right, get up. Then get ready.

112
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,560
Am I bleeding?

113
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,439
Not yet. I went easy on you.

114
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Are you really hitting me?

115
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,399
Don't say it hurts when I do.

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Come on.

117
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,210
You know what?

118
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,399
Once we're here...

119
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,240
in this ring,

120
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,090
we forget what losing is.

121
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,600
Every time I was knocked down,

122
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,879
I had to think of a way to get back up.

123
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,799
Only when I do that,

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,759
could I have the chance to win.

125
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,120
It goes the same for life.

126
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,679
No life is easy in this world.

127
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,450
If you give up once you get frustrated,

128
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,919
you will never succeed.

129
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,600
Like you won't die when you fall into the water.

130
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,919
You'll only die when you stay in the water.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,159
All you can do is swim.

132
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,360
And keep swimming.

133
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,330
Some people...

134
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,519
give up from the start.

135
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
They won't fail.

136
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,919
Because they have failed from the start.

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,720
Failure isn't scary.

138
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,879
The scary thing is...

139
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,799
you're afraid of failure.

140
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,919
I'm not giving up.

141
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,759
I'm just tired and want to get some rest.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,039
Come.

143
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,759
One-on-one.

144
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,159
Come on, get up. Again.

145
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,399
Come on, get up. Again.

146
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
Xiao Han, you're back.

147
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,210
Yes.

148
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,210
You're...

149
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm back for work.

150
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,840
I knew you were falsely accused.

151
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,360
It couldn't have been you.

152
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,879
Of course I didn't do it.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,450
Mr. Hou and the others have investigated.

154
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,399
I'm okay with it now.

155
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,799
That's great.

156
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,360
Mr. Hou wants you back to revise the bidding document, right?

157
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,480
Yes.

158
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,759
That's great.

159
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Xiao Han.

160
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,879
It's going to be up to you this time.

161
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,360
We're all counting on you.

162
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
- Thank you. - There's hope now that you're back.

163
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,039
You know what? Mr. Hou was furious with us.

164
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,120
That's right. I wanted to run out...

165
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,559
in a 100-meter dash.

166
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,559
Mr. Bao.

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,399
Mr. Hou said he has an important evening party today.

168
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,720
He'll be back a bit late.

169
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,720
He asked you to wait for him in his office.

170
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,159
Okay. Thank you.

171
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,320
Thank you.

172
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,120
- Are you getting promoted? - You're awesome.

173
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
Stop it. Nonsense.

174
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,320
The next level is the chairman.

175
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,879
Let's welcome our director back...

176
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,120
with the smallest round of applause.

177
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,279
Thank you.

178
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,279
All right.

179
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,360
Get back to work.

180
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,480
We're at the bridge.

181
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,840
Where are you?

182
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,000
Which bridge? Am I not at a bridge?

183
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,559
At the bridge.

184
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm at the bridge. Which one?

185
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,360
Right here.

186
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,440
Come down here.

187
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,360
Dolly,

188
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,679
think about it.

189
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,240
Even if you want to leave,

190
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,200
get your paycheck first.

191
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
You can't just leave without money.

192
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,879
Where can you go?

193
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,919
I don't need that small amount of money.

194
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,120
Okay.

195
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,279
That's what you said.

196
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,480
Then don't say I didn't pay you.

197
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm okay with not giving you a single penny.

198
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,919
Who cares?

199
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,159
Dolly, the money isn't a big deal.

200
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,799
Where are you staying tonight?

201
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,240
I can go to my hometown friend and crash in her basement.

202
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,600
Hai Xing.

203
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,240
Please stand up.

204
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,320
Can you be serious...

205
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,559
and apologize to Dolly?

206
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,039
Well, Dolly.

207
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,720
Today,

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
maybe you weren't in a good mood.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,399
And I was a bit harsh.

210
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,679
I apologize to you.

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm sorry. I apologize.

212
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,879
Don't be mad.

213
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,519
Let's go back.

214
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,960
I can go back.

215
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,799
But don't ever scold me again...

216
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,679
for that seductive woman who knows martial arts.

217
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,639
Dolly.

218
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,639
Show some respect.

219
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,679
That is my friend, an important one.

220
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,919
Don't call her "that woman".

221
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,840
You know who I'm talking about.

222
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,519
Don't you think you're a little too arrogant?

223
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,919
I've apologized.

224
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,039
How can you say that about her?

225
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,559
- I just can. - Okay! Stop it!

226
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,039
Stop it, all right?

227
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,240
Stop the fight.

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Dolly.

229
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,879
I can tell you responsibly...

230
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
that you're the prettiest girl...

231
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,679
I've ever met.

232
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,519
All the other women...

233
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,399
just wear cheap face powder.

234
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,559
She put a lot of sauce on her face.

235
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,720
- You... - Hai Xing, enough.

236
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,120
- Fine. - You don't understand. Dolly...

237
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,159
Go. You don't understand at all.

238
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,559
All right.

239
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,879
I was wrong, okay?

240
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,679
I'll ask Mr. Tian to make you Hai Xing Fried Rice, okay?

241
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,720
With two portions of meat.

242
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,039
I'll make it for you myself, okay? With two more eggs.

243
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,399
Let's go back.

244
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,759
That's it? You're going back?

245
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,279
Wait for me.

248
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:32,919
Hello, everyone.

249
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,840
Today, we are here...

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,639
at the commendation assembly...

251
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,679
to present Wu Shi Yi the second-class medal.

252
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,679
When carrying out the mission,

253
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,440
Wu Shi Yi protected her client...

254
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,519
regardless of the danger...

255
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,720
while putting herself at risk.

256
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,440
I've been telling you...

257
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,240
that the safety of the client is everything.

258
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,279
However,

259
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,080
every time I see you get injured...

260
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,639
because you kept your clients safe,

261
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,120
I'm happy but also sad.

262
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,759
I'm happy...

263
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,399
that you've all done your jobs very well.

264
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm sad...

265
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,639
because I really don't want you to get hurt.

266
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,559
You are like my children.

267
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,200
Every time I see my child hurt,

268
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
I am...

269
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,559
also hurt.

270
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,639
But...

271
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,240
the courage to sacrifice yourself and save others...

272
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,360
is what's noble about our profession.

273
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,200
Thank you.

274

284

is promoted from Three-Star to Four-Star!

Wu Shi Yi, please say something.

288
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,440
Yes.

289
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,170
First of all, I‘d like to thank the company...

290
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,200
for giving me the honor.

291
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,170
I've been in this profession for years.

292
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,200
I've always been asked one question.

293
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,839
Even by my parents.

294
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,200
"You protect others' lives..."

295
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,039
"with your own life."

296
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,759
"Is it worth it?"

297
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,599
I believe my teammates...

298
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,890
have also been asked the same question.

299
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,599
I have never...

300
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,079
given anyone a straight answer.

301
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,410
But today,

302
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
I think I've found the answer.

303
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,680
For our profession,

304
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,000
there's no need to think about whether if it's worth it.

305
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,440
That's where its value lies.

306
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,559
Yes.

307
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,039
I protect my clients from danger.

308
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
That's my job.

309
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,799
It's also my greatest honor.

310
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,000
I love what I do.

311
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,920
I will keep going...

312
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,839
and never discredit it.

313
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,410
That's the end of the assembly.

314
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,920
Wait. Hold on, Mr. Zhao.

315
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,000
Could I say something?

316
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,599
Mr. Hou.

317
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,440
Do you want to talk there...

318
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,799
or up here?

319
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,079
I'll go up there.

320
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,440
Hello, everyone.

321
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm Hou Jue,

322
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,759
the client of Wu Shi Yi.

323
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,650
Wu Shi Yi got injured while protecting me.

324
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,559
I feel very...

325
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,119
Very...

326
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,200
Very grateful.

327
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,200
Actually,

328
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,410
it happened so suddenly.

329
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,279
She could have just yelled, "Watch out"...

330
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,279
or "Get down".

331
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,410
And I would be fine.

332
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,960
If she had yelled that,

333
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,920
she would have fulfilled her duty.

334
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,000
But she didn't.

335
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,759
She rushed to me, risking her life.

336
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,720
Yes, she threw me to the ground and protected me.

337
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,079
I would like...

338
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,680
to say thank you to Wu Shi Yi here.

339
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,720
I would also like to thank her...

340
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,039
on behalf of my family.

341
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,839
Wu Shi Yi, thank you.

342
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,200
"For our profession,"

343
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,960
"there's no need to think about whether if it's worth it."

344
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,359
That's really well said.

345
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,079
In this profession,

346
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,759
we surely can't think whether it's worth it.

347
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,000
Otherwise, how can we protect our clients?

348
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
Isn't it the same for your rescue job?

349
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,160
Yes, that's right.

350
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,400
Not everything can be priced, right?

351
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,119
That's the biggest disagreement I have with my dad.

352
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,440
He puts price tags on everything...

353
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,480
and treats them as a business.

354
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,480
"For our profession,"

355
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,799
"there's no need to think about whether if it's worth it."

356
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,079
Welcome to Xing and Eight Guests.

357
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,119
- Go. - No.

358
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,920
- Go. - No!

359
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,759
I've asked you to go so many times.

360
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,039
Can you just go?

361
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,279
I don't want to.

362
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,079
I've made a deal with my classmate.

363
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:42,960
He's very satisfied with your background...

364
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,160
and wants you to go so much.

365
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,799
Now you suddenly refuse. You will let him lose face.

366
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,200
Why do I have to give him face?

367
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,920
I have lost mine.

368
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,079
Who can give me face?

369
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,079
Wait, he needs a substitute English teacher.

370
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,400
You are free.

371
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,759
You can look for projects and make designs during the day.

372
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,119
At night, you make extra money by teaching classes.

373
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,279
Why not?

374
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,759
He needs a teacher, so I have to be one?

375
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,559
What if he needs a cook?

376
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,599
Besides, I need a girlfriend. Why don't you introduce one to me?

377
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
You know what,

378
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,799
the girls who take classes there are very pretty.

379
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,960
I promise if you go there, you will want to stay.

380
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
Wait, don't lure me...

381
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,880
by saying the girls there are pretty.

382
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
No matter how pretty the girls are,

383
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,519
being a teacher is hard.

384
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,839
What should I teach?

385
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,680
I can't teach them...

386
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
about design or drawing.

387
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,119
They will fall asleep.

388
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
You can use English to talk about...

389
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,759
your history with girls.

390
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,839
They'll love it.

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,160
Then how can I hit on them?

392
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,039
That's not the point.

393
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,000
The point is, you can prove...

394
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,200
that you can make money by yourself.

395
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,160
Though it's not much,

396
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,519
it's at least a start.

397
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,640
Think about it.

398
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,920
Make money.

399
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,480
Then...

400
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,039
Let's do it.

401
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,680
I can teach them,

402
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,319
but you have to wait for me outside.

403
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,319
Don't go in.

404
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
Why?

405
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,759
I'll be embarrassed in front of you.

406
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,839
I can't do that.

407
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,000
I must go in.

408
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,480
And I must sit in the front row.

409
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,119
I'll put two hands on my cheeks,

410
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,079
listen to you carefully, and take notes.

411
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,720
Mr. Hou.

412
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,000
What is Mr. Sheng up to?

413
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,920
He has been keeping our goods.

414
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,079
I'll tell you.

415
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,720
He doesn't care about the business or benefit now.

416
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,720
The only thing he still cares about...

417
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,720
is his precious daughter.

418
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,240
If anyone upsets his precious daughter,

419
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,920
he will upset that person even more.

420
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,359
Hou Jue offended him,

421
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,799
but I'm the one who is suffering.

422
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,839
Mr. Hou.

423
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,839
If you say so,

424
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,640
I feel like you've got your idea.

425
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,200
What idea can I have?

426
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,079
Won't I discuss it with you?

427
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,680
We can't stick to Mr. Sheng.

428
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,119
We need to find other ways.

429
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,400
I've made contact.

430
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,440
Don't worry.

431
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,480
It's just self-defeating.

432
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,359
We were in a new country.

433
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,880
No one spoke the language well.

434
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,920
For me,

435
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,720
I knew a little English.

436
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,319
I felt like I could communicate with others.

437
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,640
So I went to talk to the teacher.

438
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,480
But as we were talking about something,

439
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,599
the teacher said, "Go ahead."

440
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,359
Meaning "please continue".

441
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,440
He let me continue.

442
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,119
But I thought it was "go a head",

443
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,799
which sounds like "idiot" in Chinese.

444
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,519
I was like, "How can you say that?"

445
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,799
So,

446
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,039
you may get such jokes on you when you go abroad.

447
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,960
But as for learning English...

448
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,480
What's the most important thing in English?

449
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,079
Grammar, I think.

450
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,799
- Words. - Phrases.

451
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
- Essay writing. - Yes.

452
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,960
These are the boring things that we hate...

453
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,000
when we first start learning English.

454
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,680
But as you continue,

455
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,599
you'll realize they're not the hardest part.

456
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,319
What's the hardest? Two words.

457
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
These two.

458
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
Yes and no.

459
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,480
Why are these two words hard?

460
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,759
It's not that they're hard to spell or pronounce.

461
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,599
But it's because they're hard to understand.

462
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,200
How so?

463
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,119
Let me give you an example.

464
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,599
I like a girl.

465
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,519
I was telling her how I feel.

466
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,079
I said, "Would you be my girlfriend?"

467
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:14,799
Would you be my girlfriend?

468
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,680
Will you be my girlfriend?

469
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,119
- How did she reply? - Yes.

470
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes, of course.

471
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,200
You're so handsome.

472
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,720
If she didn't say yes, I would.

473
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,079
I also thought she would say yes.

474
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,440
But she said no.

475
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
She said no.

476
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,119
She rejected me.

477
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,200
Why?

478
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Why?

479
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,079
She said because of her job.

480
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,720
Because of her job,

481
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,319
she turned me down.

482
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,720
So I asked her,

483
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,920
"So you won't be my girlfriend?"

484
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,640
So you don't want to be my girlfriend, right?

485
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,160
What did she say?

486
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,519
You must have been hungry.

487
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,839
Hai Xing, one more.

488
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,599
Stop eating.

489
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,440
Aren't meals served there?

490
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,519
Stop eating. It's so late.

491
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,279
I told you so many times, but you don't remember.

492
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,440
There's no one here. The candle...

493
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,240
You're so stingy.

494
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,799
Will one fried rice kill you?

495
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,160
I...

496
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,279
- Drink some water first. - I don't want it.

497
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,519
- Listen to me. - Drink some.

498
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,559
You've talked so much today.

499
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,599
Hurry up.

500
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,279
Shi Yi, aren't you hungry?

501
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,519
No, I'm not.

502
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,599
Look at him.

503
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,720
How did he do today?

504
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,680
How can you not know by looking at him?

505
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,759
Not very well.

506
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,839
He did a great job.

507
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,240
It's true.

508
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,400
It's a pity he won't be a teacher.

509
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,759
He...

510
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,599
His class was exciting.

511
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,119
Everyone loved to listen to him.

512
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,880
Judging from your words...

513
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,160
and your attitude,

514
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,519
are you kind of falling in love with me?

515
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,960
Stop talking nonsense.

516
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,440
Who's talking nonsense?

517
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,680
What did you think I was talking about?

518
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,160
I meant that kind of love.

519
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,400
A student's love for a teacher.

520
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,680
Craving knowledge.

521
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,359
Pure admiration.

522
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,359
Look how smug he is.

523
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,119
Can I get money after the two-hour class today?

524
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
Yes, of course.

525
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,559
Saturdays and Sundays, one class each.

526
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,039
Two hundred yuan per lesson.

527
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,480
You'll get the paycheck on the tenth of the following month.

528
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,000
What did I say?

529
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,599
Money isn't a problem.

530
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,119
Now I'm making money.

531
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,720
The kid has grown up.

532
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm glad.

533
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,640
Glad about what? Fry the rice!

534
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,839
As a reward for you.

535
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,319
You're really going to eat.

536
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
It's for you.

537
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,680
The coffee is getting worse.

538
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,519
Chen Chen is getting slower.

539
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,640
She has always been like that.

540
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,880
- Finally. - She's coming.

541
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,359
Look at her legs.

542
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,599
- And the high heels. - Can you stop?

543
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,960
Cappuccino, please.

544
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,680
Last evening,

545
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,279
your dad arranged the designers just for you.

546
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,319
How was it?

547
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,240
A very boring evening.

548
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,359
Don't tell me you're not interested in any of them.

549
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,160
You're so demanding.

550
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,720
It's not like that.

551
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,440
They all looked the same to me.

552
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,480
Boring.

553
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,720
That one is fine, right?

554
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
Yes, so fine. You can have him.

555
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,680
Chen Chen, are you lovesick as well?

556
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,599
The more you can't have someone, the more you want him.

557
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,759
Don't compare Hou Jue to everyone else.

558
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,759
In my opinion, every man is better...

559
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
and more successful than him.

560
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
I know. I'm not saying he's great.

561
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

562
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,680
Maybe it's because he's different.

563
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
So did he contact you after that?

564
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,400
This guy...

565
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
He was kicked out by his dad.

566
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,000
He brought nothing with him,

567
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,359
but a female sidekick.

568
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,799
He must be out of his mind.

569
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,000
I would say just ignore him.

570
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,920
Just let him...

571
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,079
and that woman cuddle in his little room.

572
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,720
Can you not bring her up?

573
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,240
That woman is just annoying.

574
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,880
Listen.

575
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,799
I've seen too many men like Hou Jue.

576
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
He doesn't even have a love quotient.

577
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,319
He just gets close to whoever is near him.

578
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,160
His level is too low to match yours.

579
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,559
- Too low. - Can't I improve his level?

580
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,319
You can't.

581
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,599
I told you.

582
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,440
He has never seen classy girls...

583
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,200
like us.

584
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,599
Fix your shirt.

585
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,839
It's so classy.

586
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,240
You're so classy.

587
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,920
You scare everyone away when they see you, right?

588
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,519
She's getting serious.

589
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
It's love, Chen Chen.

590
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,759
Love.

591
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
What are you looking at?

592
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,559
It tastes good. So good.

593
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes.

594
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,359
You're not back yet?

595
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,319
Okay, I'm not in a hurry.

596
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
I'll wait for your call when you get back.

597
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,839
Okay.

598
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,359
Thank you.

599
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,839
What's the matter? Still abroad?

600
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,839
Just an excuse.

601
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,599
He doesn't want to meet me.

602
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,039
I'm used to it.

603
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,799
Ms. Chen.

604
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,480
How can I help?

605
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,559
Get downstairs now.

606
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm in front of the restaurant.

607
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
What are you doing?

608
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,440
Come down. Bye.

609
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,880
Chen Chen is here.

610
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,240
I wonder what she's up to.

611
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
I'll go and have a look.

612
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I won't go far.

613
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:38,079
Ms. Chen.

614
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,640
So your personal nanny doesn't follow you?

615
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,480
What's the matter? I'm busy.

616
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,400
Busy?

617
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,680
So you mean you're not free to design a book bar?

618
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,720
Stop kidding.

619
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,839
No one's kidding. I'm serious.

620
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,519
Then I'll be serious with you too.

621
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,960
When I was in college in the US,

622
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,480
I designed a large bookstore.

623
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,160
You could have coffee and shop inside.

624
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
But the project failed.

625
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,079
That's about right.

626
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,880
My friend in Shenzhen plans to open a book bar.

627
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,480
He asked me to recommend someone.

628
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,880
He wasn't satisfied with the eight people I found.

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Do you want to give it a try?

630
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,960
Then why did you come to me?

631
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,199
Because you're outstanding.

632
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,480
Mostly because...

633
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,239
you're the poorest among the people I know.

634
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,559
No one else would want such a small opportunity.

635
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,000
If you say so, I'll want the opportunity.

636
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:30,329
All right then. I'll go with you tomorrow.

637
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,039
Get your proposal ready.

638
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,639
I'll book the flight ticket for you.

639
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,719
Think of it as helping the poor.

640
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,480
Then you're very precise in helping the poor this time.

641
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,519
Of course.

642
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,159
Is it that urgent? Leaving tomorrow?

643
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
You're already in such a situation.

644
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,559
Are you still expecting everything to go your way?

645
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,239
I was just asking.

646
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,719
What do they need from me?

647
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,920
A good design. That's it.

648
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,809
A good design?

649
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,329
Then I'll go back and prepare a few designs.

650
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,480
All right. Thank you.

651
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,599
If you really want to thank me,

652
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,719
don't let me see the nanny who follows you all day.

653
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,199
- Fine. - She's annoying.

654
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,199
Bye.

655
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,239
- Don't bring her along. - Bye.

656
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,519
Well...

657
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,809
Chen Chen got me a project.

658
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,960
I might go to Shenzhen tomorrow.

659
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,769
But there's one condition from her.

660
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,289
I can't follow you, right?

661
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:44,809
Yes.

662
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,880
No problem.

663
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,329
I'll report to Mr. Zhao.

664
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,480
The company will arrange someone else.

665
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,599
Okay.

666
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,769
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,289
What for?

668
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,039
Do you think I want to go on a business trip with Chen Chen?

669
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,719
I cherish my life.

670
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,039
Okay, then you can talk to Mr. Zhao.

671
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,599
Your contract expires tomorrow.

672
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,809
After I get back from Shenzhen,

673
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,519
I'll go to your company to renew the contract with you.

674
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,289
You can get to your work for now.

675
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,360
Okay.

676
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:26,809
I'll go to work.

677
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,329
One-day seclusion for me.

678
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm focusing on designing. Do not disturb.

679
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:33,599
92.

680
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:36,920
93.

681
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:39,769
94.

682
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,719
Shi Yi, the milk is ready.

683
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,719
Okay.

684
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Hai Xing.

685
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,199
You can stop.

686
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,519
Qian Qian said she'll come after breakfast.

687
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:35,329
I know.

688
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,920
Coming here after a meal?

689
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,289
She's being too polite.

690
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:41,920
She doesn't like troubling people.

691
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,289
It'll be easier to just pick Hou Jue up and leave.

692
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,360
What if she gets hungry on the way?

693
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,809
What if she didn't have much?

694
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,599
Better safe than sorry. I'll prepare it for her.

695
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,039
Let me pass.

696
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,880
Hou Jue, come down. The meal's ready.

697
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,079
Coming.

698
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,440
You fried an egg for me?

699
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:15,559
Are you sleepy? You haven't slept at all.

700
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,000
No, not at all. I'm feeling great right now.

701
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,599
I'm full of energy.

702
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,400
Eat up and regain your strength.

703
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,639
After finishing the egg,

704
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,679
I'll be even more energetic.

705
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,119
Slow down. You'll make it.

706
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,119
Mr. Hou.

707
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,599
Can we go now?

708
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,809
I'm coming.

709
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,079
Have some more. You haven't had much.
