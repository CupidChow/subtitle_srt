(Episode 23)

4
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you for staying by my side.

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,040
Do you think it's worth it?

6
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,560
I feel like this is a path I must go through in my life.

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,519
I have to walk this path...

8
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,280
to meet the people I must meet.

9
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Looking at this the other way around,

10
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,319
if you want to meet the people you must meet,

11
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
you must walk an inevitable path.

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,159
I told you before.

13
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,199
Even if I just stay at home,

14
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,120
I can relax for the rest of my life.

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,159
But I don't want that.

16
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,000
I want to have more experience.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,370
I want to explore out here as much as I can.

18
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,370
I want to enrich myself...

19
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,530
and become an interesting person.

20
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,680
I want more people to like me.

21
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,199
I originally came to persuade you.

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,280
Because this was my fault after all.

23
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,800
But I've changed my mind.

24
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,680
You're right.

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,280
You have to walk an inevitable path...

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,599
to meet the people you must meet.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,080
It's good to experience it.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

29
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,280
Have you ever seen a shooting star as a child?

30
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,479
Yes.

31
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,680
I've never seen one before.

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,520
Then your life...

33
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
isn't very plentiful either.

34
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,319
We might be able to see one today.

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,599
- What? - It's a reflection on the glass.

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,159
You're so annoying.

37
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Pull over right here.

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Don't go any further.

39
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,159
Shengda suddenly raised the price of the precast slabs...

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,280
by eight percent.

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,960
They claim it's because the market isn't doing well right now.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
This puts us in a very passive position.

43
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,039
We quoted our prices to the client based on the buying price.

44
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,120
If he raises the price by eight percent,

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,680
then we'll have to bear the losses.

46
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,759
I said everything I could,

47
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,279
but they wouldn't budge.

48
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
They said it was their boss's orders.

49
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,680
Mr. Hou.

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,959
It's hard for people of our rank to solve this problem.

51
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay, I got it.

52
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,959
- You may go. - Okay.

53
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,839
It looks like...

54
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,079
Mr. Sheng doesn't consider us as a friend anymore.

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,439
He reacted quite quickly.

56
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,879
He sure went all out to teach me a lesson.

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Mr. Hou Junior.

58
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,240
All my car keys and bank cards are here.

59
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,079
Help me give them to Mr. Hou.

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,199
Now, I'm going to my office...

61
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,279
to make a copy of my personal files.

62
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,079
That's okay, right?

63
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,199
Yes.

64
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,079
Come in.

65
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,730
Mr. Hou.

66
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,610
Mr. Hou Junior told me to give this to you.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
You may leave.

68
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,439
What is Mr. Hou Junior...

69
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,399
That brat.

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,040
He's actually being serious.

71
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,319
He gave up everything...

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
and declared independence from me.

73
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,639
You love him so much.

74
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,920
The company is in such tough times right now,

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,959
yet he's doing this.

76
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,720
That's just wrong.

77
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,879
Just let him go.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,600
He'd better go as far as he can.

79
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,160
Out of sight, out of mind.

80
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,000
Just let him go.

81
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
He's still a kid.

82
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,319
He's being immature for doing this.

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,879
You must not take this to heart...

84
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,680
and harm your own health.

85
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
It's not worth it.

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
If he were still young,

87
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,240
I could say he didn't know any better.

88
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,720
I could forgive him.

89
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,279
But he's all grown up now.

90
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,079
There's no way I'll forgive him.

91
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,439
Don't say that.

92
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,519
A father and son can't be at odds forever.

93
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,879
He'll come around one day.

94
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,759
Besides,

95
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,800
exploring out there is good for him too.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
He should suffer a bit more.

97
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,399
Then he'll become more mature.

98
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,160
He has no idea how difficult the world out there is.

99
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,360
It looks like he won't turn back until he hits a dead end.

100
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,959
He's hopeless.

101
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,519
He has always been rebellious.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
He insists on showing me that he can handle things alone.

103
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm really worried about him.

104
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,439
Ma Yong.

105
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,279
We've been through so many obstacles and challenges...

106
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,680
throughout all these years.

107
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,360
We've experienced failure and betrayal.

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
Although our enemies were everywhere,

109
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,160
we were never alone.

110
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,319
Thank you.

111
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
Thank goodness you're here.

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,279
I feel a lot more relieved.

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,399
Why don't you have some water?

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
It's okay. You can get back to work.

115
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,120
I want to be alone for a bit.

116
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,279
Is there anything else you need to take?

117
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,639
No. I'm not taking anything else.

118
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
This is all I need.

119
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Come on.

120
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,600
I never realized how tall this building was.

121
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,399
You know, my dad's business is doing well.

122
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,559
I just muddle along like a nobody every day...

123
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,679
and I keep going against him.

124
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,919
It's quite fun, isn't it?

125
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,600
Apologize to your dad...

126
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,919
and tell him that you've thought it through.

127
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,759
You can just work seriously from now on.

128
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,879
That's impossible.

129
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,519
If I'm alone,

130
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,720
I can live however I want whether it's good or bad.

131
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Isn't that right?

132
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,559
Why is smoke coming out of this bike?

133
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,210
Watch out!

134
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,210
- Be careful. Run! - Run!

135
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Run!

136
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,159
Why did you jump on me again?

137
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,210
Get up.

138
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,279
Get up.

139
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Shi Yi.

140
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,210
Shi Yi.

141
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,330
Shi Yi.

142
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,879
Shi Yi.

143
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
- What's going on? - What happened?

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,159
What happened?

145
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,210
What happened?

146
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,120
I have no idea, Mr. Ma. There's smoke and fire.

147
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,210
Hurry and take a look.

148
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
There's a fire down there.

149
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Is this the Security Department?

150
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,879
I'm Ma Yong.

151
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,519
What's going on downstairs?

152
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,210
What?

153
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
- What's going on? - What's happening?

154
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Is there a fire?

155
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
- Where's the fire? - What's going on?

156
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,519
There's a fire!

157
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,039
No way.

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Something has happened.

159
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,360
Mr. Hou, there's trouble.

160
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,039
What happened?

161
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,240
You're in such a panic.

162
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,960
There was an explosion downstairs.

163
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,480
It happened right next to Hou Jue's car.

164
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,399
Where's Hou Jue now?

165
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,639
Where is he?

166
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,639
Hou Jue is at the scene of the accident.

167
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,919
But his situation is unknown.

168
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,679
Who is trying to harm him?

169
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,559
No. I need to go and have a look.

170
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,679
Are you sure?

171
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,919
I'm going to have a look.

172
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,159
Mr. Hou.

173
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,559
- All right. - What's wrong?

174
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,200
Hou Jue is fine.

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,279
Are you sure?

176
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,120
He's safe and sound.

177
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
But Wu Shi Yi got injured from protecting him.

178
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,919
She's already in the hospital.

179
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,799
Are you okay?

180
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,440
Thank goodness he has a bodyguard.

181
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,360
Thank goodness for Wu Shi Yi.

182
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,039
That scared me.

183
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,159
Good thing Shi Yi was there.

184
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,960
Otherwise, Hou Jue would have been doomed.

185
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,080
That scared me to death.

186
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,440
- Gosh, my heart. - Are you okay?

187
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,240
Take it slow.

188
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,279
Slowly.

189
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,279
Go to the scene right now and check the situation.

190
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,600
- Don't mind me. Go on. - Okay.

191
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,360
- Hurry. - Don't worry. Calm down.

192
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,519
Officer.

193
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,240
How is the investigation going?

194
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,559
Things should be fine now.

195
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
We won't know until we get the results of the investigation.

196
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,759
Doctor, how is she?

197
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,320
She has been stitched up. The patient is conscious.

198
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,080
- Did she get stitches? - Yes.

199
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,840
- How many stitches did she get? - Ten stitches.

200
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,200
She suffered a wound on her left rib.

201
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
Is there anything else we need to be careful of?

202
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,440
She has to come back on time to get her dressing changed.

203
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,960
Is her injury serious?

204
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,080
It's not that serious.

205
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,279
It's just a superficial wound.

206
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,320
Her internal organs are unharmed.

207
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,559
All right, doctor.

208
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,639
Thank you.

209
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Mr. Hou.

210
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,279
Please come with us to the station to assist the investigation.

211
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Can you let me take a look at her after she comes out first?

212
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,159
Mr. Hou, don't worry.

213
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,159
We're here.

214
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,080
Go with the police.

215
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
- Okay. - Let's go.

216
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,240
- Look after her. - Okay.

217
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,440
- Look after her. - I'm here.

218
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,559
Don't worry.

219
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,720
Zhou Quan, go with them.

220
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
- Take care of Mr. Hou. - Okay.

221
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,039
- Be careful. - Don't worry.

222
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
How are you feeling?

223
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,279
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

224
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,559
Shi Yi.

225
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,559
Where's Hou Jue?

226
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,559
Is he okay?

227
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,799
He's fine.

228
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,039
He stayed with you the whole time.

229
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,559
The police just took him away to help with the investigation.

230
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm glad he's okay.

231
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,360
Shi Yi, don't worry.

232
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,919
I've already asked Zhou Quan to replace you...

233
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,039
and protect Mr. Hou around the clock.

234
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,320
Just focus on getting better.

235
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,080
It's really just a small injury.

236
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,039
It's true. I'll be fine in a couple of days.

237
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,200
This is our discipline.

238
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,720
It's not just for your health,

239
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,679
but it's also for the safety of our clients.

240
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Excuse me.

241
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,080
We need to take the patient to the observation room first.

242
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

243
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,120
It's okay.

244
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,759
Shi Yi.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,759
I've asked the company to evaluate this incident.

246
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Don't worry.

247
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
You should be getting a promotion...

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
and there will be a reward too.

249
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

250
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,639
Hello.

251
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,799
Mr. Hou.

252
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,240
I just got back from the scene of the explosion.

253
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,080
It's basically confirmed that it was caused...

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
by the aging of the electric bike's battery.

255
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,080
It was an accident.

256
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm relieved then.

257
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,879
Why don't you go to the hospital...

258
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,759
and see how Wu Shi Yi is now?

259
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,480
Okay, I'll go right away.

260
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,399
By the way, I looked into it.

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,080
Ever since Hou Jue moved out,

262
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,240
he has been staying with Hai Xing.

263
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,080
Okay, I got it.

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ms. Zhang.

265
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,519
Make some ginseng chicken soup tonight.

266
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,519
Yes.

267
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,200
Work has been really busy lately.

268
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,360
Mr. Hou needs something to nourish his health.

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,159
Okay, thank you.

270
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,919
The hotel is not far from Zhirong Building,

271
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,159
but it will take a few turns to get there.

272
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,679
You saw it yourself.

273
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,240
There aren't many cars on this street...

274
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
and it's quite hidden.

275
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
Until Shi Yi recovers,

276
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,960
the new bodyguard will be there.

277
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,159
- After that... - Don't let Shi Yi leave Hou Jue.

278
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
All right?

279
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,799
Don't do that.

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,720
Shi Yi just did what every bodyguard would do...

281
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,080
I know.

282
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,200
But I still don't want that.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,039
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,359
I might be selfish for doing this.

285
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,440
But there's something more...

286
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,440
to Shi Yi and Hou Jue's relationship.

287
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,170
Whether they admit it or not,

288
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,079
I feel reassured with Shi Yi by Hou Jue's side.

289
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,890
Okay.

290
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,480
I'll tell Mr. Zhao.

291
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,170
One more thing.

292
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,519
Qian Qian.

293
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,650
Promise me one thing.

294
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,650
Okay?

295
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,279
Tell me.

296
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,519
Quit being a bodyguard.

297
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,799
It's too dangerous.

298
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,359
I don't go out in the field.

299
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,410
I know, but I still don't want that.

300
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,759
When I think of what might happen...

301
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,480
If something goes wrong and something happens to you,

302
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
what will I do?

303
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,200
I'll be alone. I have heart disease.

304
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,650
I won't be able to take it.

305
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,650
I promise you.

307
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,960
I'll be sad.

308
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,319
I'm here.

309
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,559
This day has finally come.

310
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
But I didn't think it would come so soon.

311
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,839
When will it be held?

312
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,039
Hold what?

313
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,480
The celebration, of course.

314
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,680
You told me...

315
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,359
that unless you get married and focus on your family,

316
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,480
you won't ever leave the company.

317
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,170
It seems like...

318
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,680
it was just yesterday when you said those words.

319
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,480
We're not at that stage yet.

320
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,279
He's just my boyfriend now.

321
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,170
He wants me to enjoy life.

322
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,839
In that case,

323
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,240
I can't approve your resignation.

324
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,650
I'll approve it...

325
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,890
when you get your marriage certificate.

326
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,240
Mr. Zhao.

327
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,359
I...

328
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,279
Look at how scared you are.

329
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
Are you that afraid of ending up alone?

330
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,279
It's not that.

331
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,650
It's mainly because...

332
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,200
it wasn't easy to find someone who suits me quite well.

333
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,240
It's also rare for the company...

334
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,519
to find a great instructor like you.

335
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,440
How about this?

336
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,960
Take a month's leave first.

337
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,200
If you still want to quit after that,

338
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,650
you can come back to complete the formalities.

339
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,480
When girls fall in love,

340
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,759
they're easily impulsive.

341
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,519
All right.

342
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,680
It's decided.

343
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,559
Mr. Zhao.

344
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Thank you.

345
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,839
I'm not asking anything of you.

346
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
I only want one thing.

347
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,480
You have to be happy.

348
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,519
Show all the girls in the company...

349
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,170
that you can still find a good man...

350
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,319
while working in our industry.

351
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,650
Yes!

352
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,200
I'll accomplish this mission!

353
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,799
What are you doing?

354
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,720
- What are you doing? - I'll help them move it downstairs.

355
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Drop it.

356
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,759
Your wound will open up.

357
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,759
It's okay.

358
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,119
It's just a small injury. I can still work.

359
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,890
Go downstairs and stay there. Don't mess around.

360
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,160
Hurry down there.

361
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,960
Go on. Go downstairs.

362
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,680
- You're here. - Are you eating?

363
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,039
Would you like some?

364
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,039
I'm not hungry. Eat up.

365
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,279
The soup is here.

366
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,279
Here.

367
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,519
Shi Yi, try this soup and see if it's good.

368
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,119
If it's not salty enough, just add some salt.

369
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,359
If it's not fragrant enough,

370
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,640
add some spring onions.

371
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,559
Hou Jue has given me his orders.

372
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,680
I have to take good care of you...

373
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,880
as if you're in your postpartum period.

374
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,680
This looks quite good.

375
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,799
Give me a bowl too.

376
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,920
It's only for Shi Yi.

377
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
There's none for you.

378
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,640
You can drink it. I'm not hungry anyway.

379
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,440
No. You'd better drink it.

380
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,759
Take good care of your health.

381
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,119
I wasn't even in a big accident.

382
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,839
Just move that bed to the room across the hall.

383
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,119
Let's turn this double room into a family room.

384
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,119
It will even raise the value of this place.

385
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,240
How is it? Do you like it?

386
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,400
It's a lot more spacious with the bed gone.

387
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,640
But you see, right here...

388
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,559
I need a table.

389
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,000
I have to work, right?

390
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,519
I'm also missing...

391
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,519
Let's go to the furniture store later.

392
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,920
Furniture store?

393
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
What money do you have?

394
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,799
Save as much money as you can when you start up a business.

395
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,240
I have to be strict with you in this aspect.

396
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
It's okay. I'll just modify the door panel in the kitchen...

397
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,079
and bring it to you.

398
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,839
Buddy, I'm a designer.

399
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,160
What can I do with a door panel? Cut pork?

400
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,319
Don't worry. It's quite artistic.

401
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,319
It will fit the vibes of a designer perfectly...

402
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,000
after I put some work into it.

403
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,640
All right then.

404
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,799
Bring me that chair I gave to you before.

405
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,279
Why don't I give you my chair?

406
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,920
- My chair is really comfortable. - No, it's okay.

407
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
I'll just use mine.

408
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,000
I've had it for years.

409
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
I'll just give it to you, okay?

410
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
I want mine.

411
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,480
Yours is gone.

412
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,640
What do you mean?

413
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,480
It's just gone.

414
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Where did it go?

415
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,680
It has probably become about 25kg of pork,

416
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,119
30kg of eggs,

417
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,799
and several plates of fried rice.

418
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,960
Did you sell it?

419
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,960
It's a waste of money just to sit on that chair.

420
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Never mind a chair...

421
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,440
I could've done it myself if I wanted to sell it.

422
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,400
All right. Think about something else.

423
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,279
Do you still have any clothes to wear?

424
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,119
- You should change. - No.

425
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
What should we do then?

426
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,839
Take yours off and give them to me.

427
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,359
We have different body figures.

428
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,440
You can't save money on this.

429
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,799
Let's go. I'll take you shopping.

430
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
You even sold my chair.

431
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,519
From now on,

432
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,400
you need to change your spending habits.

433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,079
I'll help you to start getting used to it today.

434
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,640
This is the only place you can shop.

435
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,000
I won't say anything later.

436
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,279
Let's see how you bargain.

437
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,720
Show me your skills.

438
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,319
- This way. - Take a look at these socks.

439
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,000
- How much are these socks? - They're three yuan.

440
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
You're here.

441
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,160
Sir, this is my friend.

442
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,839
He wants a few pairs of socks.

443
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,759
It's showtime.

444
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
So...

445
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,039
how much is one pair?

446
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Three yuan a pair.

447
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,359
They're three yuan a pair?

448
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,880
Give me 3 pairs for 10 yuan then.

449
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Sure.

450
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,680
Are you stupid? You ask for 10 yuan for 3 pairs?

451
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,920
They're only three yuan a pair.

452
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,720
Give me four pairs then.

453
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,039
Fine.

454
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Move aside.

455
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,440
Give us 10 pairs for 20 yuan.

456
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,759
Eight pairs.

457
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,839
Don't do this. We're buddies. Give me nine pairs.

458
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,319
I'll give you eight pairs. Take it or leave it.

459
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,319
Pay up.

460
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,079
Just 8 pairs? I could haggle for 10 pairs.

461
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,440
Shut up, you spoiled brat. Pay up.

462
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,920
- Someone is coming! - Someone is coming!

463
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,079
- Someone is coming! - Where?

464
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
What are you doing?

465
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,119
- Chase after him! - Don't chase me.

466
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Stop!

467
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
This way.

468
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,400
Stop chasing me!

469
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,880
Be careful.

470
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
One.

471
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,519
Two.

472
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,160
How many pairs are there?

473
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,799
How many pairs are there?

474
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,240
Ten pairs.

475
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,599
There are 10 pairs. I got 2 extra pairs.

476
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,920
The spoiled brat has grown up. He has matured.

477
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,519
- Good. - That's very good.

478
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,519
Excellent!

479
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Mr. Hou.

480
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,359
Why are you still up so late?

481
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,480
I'm fine. I can't sleep.

482
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm going down to have a chat with Shi Yi.

483
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,799
Okay, be careful.

484
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,880
Why aren't you in bed?

485
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,599
- This is the final... - I'll sleep soon.

486
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:04,599
of the Women's 50kg category at the Fifth National...

487
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,039
- Sanda Championships. - I'm watching this video first.

488
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,519
Right now, the red fighter, Wu Shi Yi, is attacking back.

489
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,440
- What are you watching? - Her counterattack is working.

490
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,359
It's an old video from when I won a championship.

491
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,839
- Qian Qian sent it to me. - The blue fighter strikes back...

492
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,440
with a whip kick! It worked!

493
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,559
Since that day,

494
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,960
it has been exactly seven years.

495
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,279
You used to compete and train so hard, didn't you?

496
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,440
I'm quite grateful for those days though.

497
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
No matter what I faced afterward, it didn't seem as bad.

498
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
She is the champion!

499
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,519
I've been meaning to talk to you lately.

500
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,240
I've been wanting to thank you,

501
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,559
but I couldn't bring myself to say it.

502
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,000
But I still have to thank you.

503
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,279
After spending a lot of time with you,

504
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,880
I think...

505
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,319
I was lucky to meet you.

506
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You're exaggerating.

507
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
It would be the same no matter who it is.

508
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
It would be different.

509
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,559
It would be completely different.

510
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,359
I've been meaning to ask you these few days.

511
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,759
Considering your current situation,

512
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,119
you won't be able to pay for the bodyguard service.

513
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,920
Can you tell me...

514
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,160
what you sold when you went to Mr. Tian's brother's place?

515
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,400
I went to discuss an investment.

516
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,640
I wanted to see if there were any good investment projects.

517
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,400
I went...

518
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,279
My mom left me a jade pendant.

519
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,480
I exchanged it for some money...

520
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,000
so that I would have some cash flow.

521
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,599
I'll get it back in two months.

522
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,279
The jade pendant from your mom?

523
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,200
It's so precious. How could you sell it?

524
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,079
I didn't sell it. I...

525
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,160
I pawned it there.

526
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,279
He gave me some money...

527
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,599
and I'm using it for now.

528
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,640
Then I'll buy it back.

529
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
All right.

530
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,279
Until you can get the jade pendant back,

531
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,960
you don't have to pay me anything.

532
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,000
That won't do.

533
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,960
I'm not discussing this with you.

534
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,039
I'll only fulfill my contract on this condition.

535
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,440
But this is how you earn a living. How can you...

I won't stop paying you your bodyguard fee.

You're definitely getting paid.

I still have to pay you.

543

I don't care. I have to pay you.

544
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,079
Besides, there's no way I can't pay for a bodyguard.

What time and where?

555

Adjust it a little more to the right.

That's good.

557

Make sure it's well-mounted.

558

No, go ahead. I'll finish this.

No, I won't.

Okay. Just make sure it's secure.

He told me to enjoy my life.

I even handed in my resignation letter to Mr. Zhao.

But he didn't approve it.

00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,809
The doctor said I'm recovering well and I'm fine.

660
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:50,719
Don't make a fuss over a dressing change.

661
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:51,880
I told you that you didn't need to come.

662
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,079
No, you got hurt because of me.

663
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,679
I had to come and watch you.

664
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,559
Well, you saw me. You can relax now.

665
00:39:58,809 --> 00:39:59,920
We can go now.

666
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,679
- I still have something to do. - Where are you going?

667
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,920
My gosh. I'm not your bodyguard right now.

668
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,880
Can I arrange my own life?

669
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,920
You can arrange your own life,

670
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,360
but only on my watch.

671
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,119
It's my mom's birthday.

672
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,289
Can I take some time off?

673
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:22,119
I'll reluctantly agree then.

674
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Thank you.

675
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,159
Students, we'll end the class here today.

676
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,159
Class dismissed.

677

- Goodbye, Ms. Zhang. - Goodbye, Ms. Zhang.

Bye.

Let's go.

680
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,719
- Okay. - Let's go.

681
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,639
There was a lot of material today.

682
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:40,769
- That's right. - Come on.

683
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:47,809
Hello.

What?

I'll be right downstairs.
