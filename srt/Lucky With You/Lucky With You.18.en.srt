(Episode 18)

4
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,159
How are we irrational?

5
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,159
Other than drinking a bit every day, how are we irrational?

6
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,280
Hai Xing, listen to me. Don't worry. Keep going.

7
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,719
Just save it.

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,079
That's easy for you to say.

9
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,480
Whatever you say is right when you have money.

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
Do you understand?

11
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,799
I trust Shi Yi.

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,359
Shi Yi, I'll listen to you.

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
What do you want to hear from me?

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Talk some sense into me.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,760
How do I do that?

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,959
I think love...

17
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,370
isn't something you'll get just because you work hard.

18
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,560
You won't necessarily be rewarded...

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
even if you put in your effort.

20
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,090
Sometimes,

21
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,840
God may be testing you on purpose.

22
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,560
But sometimes,

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,810
maybe God is trying to tell you...

24
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,199
that there's no way out and you need to turn back.

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,199
Then tell me.

26
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,479
Should I turn back or not?

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,319
- Yes. - What are you talking about?

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,039
Don't turn back.

29
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
Go ahead.

30
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,479
Hold onto your heart and go ahead.

31
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,479
There's no looking back.

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
You'll eventually reach the destination.

33
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,840
It's better not to ask you two.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm so troubled.

35
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,599
It's killing me.

36
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,520
Don't be upset. Cook us some food.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,759
We've only been eating peanuts.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,639
You've got skills.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,840
It's a nice tea.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
The tea is not bad.

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,319
Zhi Rong.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,199
The price of the material is not a problem.

43
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,280
I can guarantee.

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,919
It's the cheapest in the industry.

45
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,400
Others won't get this price.

46
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,719
Mr. Sheng, with your guarantee,

47
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,280
I feel more at ease now.

48
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,199
I think we'll win the bidding.

49
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,159
All right.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,199
Have some tea.

51
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm done with my matters.

52
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,240
Mr. Sheng.

53
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,719
Tell me about yours.

54
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,319
Zhi Rong.

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,639
Look.

56
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,439
Do you think...

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,280
there's a possibility...

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
to bring our relationship closer?

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
Closer?

60
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,840
Mr. Sheng.

61
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,730
Are you planning to introduce me to your sister who's an artist?

62
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,759
I really don't want to get married.

63
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,170
Please.

64
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,959
That's definitely prejudice.

65
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,360
My sister is already taken.

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,120
He's even 10 years younger than her.

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,170
- Really? - Of course.

68
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,120
She really is an artist.

69
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,399
She's very progressive.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Zhi Rong.

71
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,120
Let's be serious.

72
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,360
I'm suggesting...

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,199
to unite our families through our children.

74
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,120
- Go ahead. - Look, Hou Jue and Chen Chen...

75
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,920
are about the same age.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,079
They both studied abroad.

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,319
And Chen Chen also majored in design.

78
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,000
Our families know each other well.

79
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,399
If you're not against it,

80
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,360
let them meet each other.

81
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,000
It would be great if they're meant to be together.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,839
But it's okay if they don't become a couple.

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
Mr. Sheng, that's an excellent suggestion.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,519
I support you.

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,439
And let me tell you.

86
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,319
Hou Jue just got out of an unreliable relationship.

87
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,040
Your suggestion came right in time.

88
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,120
Then ask him.

89
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
See what he has to say about it.

90
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,600
Chen Chen is surely okay with it.

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,399
Okay, I'll call him right now.

92
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,120
What's the rush?

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
This isn't a mission.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
Regarding this matter,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,240
we should respect their opinion, right?

96
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,439
Their opinion?

97
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,160
What can he say?

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,480
My opinion is his opinion.

99
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,399
- All right. - It's settled then.

100
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,959
- Okay. - Here, Mr. Sheng. Have some tea.

101
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,959
Let's drink.

102
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,480
Hou Jue.

103
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,759
I've wasted my breath on you.

104
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,399
Why do you seem like you didn't hear anything?

105
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,879
That's enough. Stop eating.

106
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,519
I'm asking what you think of it.

107
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,360
It's good.

108
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,120
It's good. I agree.

109
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,439
Why do I have this feeling...

110
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,959
that this brat is all grown up all of a sudden?

111
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,279
Did the sun rise from the west today?

112
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,759
It's just a blind date, isn't it?

113
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
That's good.

114
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
You're going to introduce me to a pretty lady.

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,079
Why would I be upset?

116
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,759
Besides,

117
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,519
I'm quite talented when it comes to ladies, Dad.

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,279
I remember Chen Chen.

119
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,439
She has been good-looking since she was little.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,600
It's just that she was spoiled...

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,639
and has got a temper.

122
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
How is she now?

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,319
Let me meet her.

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
You said it yourself.

125
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,680
You have to keep your word.

126
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,959
You're quite free in the afternoon.

127
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,439
Why don't you ask her out?

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't worry, Dad. Leave it to me.

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,800
- Don't worry. - Don't go back on your words.

130
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,800
- Hello, Mr. Hou. - Hello, Mr. Hou.

131
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,240
- Hello, Mr. Hou. - Hello, Mr. Hou.

132
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,319
Hello, Mr. Hou.

133
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,360
Take a guess why my dad asked to see me.

134
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,600
He wants you to go on a blind date.

135
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,199
So you heard it.

136
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,319
Don't be sad.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,160
You're gloating.

138
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,199
What else could it be?

139
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
This time,

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,480
my dad is going to introduce me...

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,759
to a goddess.

142
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,040
She can be considered...

143
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,959
as my childhood sweetheart.

144
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,279
We grew up together,

145
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,240
but I don't remember much about her.

146
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,240
But I've decided to give up on you too.

147
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,480
That's a very good choice.

148
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,090
Congratulations.

149
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,639
I know you're upset,

150
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,720
but there's nothing I can do.

151
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,960
I'll do my best this time...

152
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,919
so that I can get married soon.

153
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,759
That's great.

154
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,360
I'm very happy for you.

155
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,840
I will be relieved if you get married soon.

156
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,679
Fine, cry if you want to.

157
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,559
We're family. It's okay.

158
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,919
Just cry.

159
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,240
I won't look at you.

160
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,519
I won't look at you. You can cry now.

161
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,279
Why?

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,330
Why?

163
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,039
I gave it my all

164
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,600
But I'm still

165
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,679
Never going to get you

166
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,679
Why...

167
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,159
Hi, Hai Xing.

168
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,279
There's a chance to be rich.

169
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,639
I wonder if you're interested.

170
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,210
You're a liar. Get lost.

171
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,330
You liar

172
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,159
Are you here to deceive me too?

173
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,960
This guy...

174
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,879
I want a design proposal by Zhirong Construction.

175
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,879
I'll give you 100,000 yuan.

176
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Who are you?

177
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,000
How do you know my name?

178
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,679
Why do you want the proposal?

179
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm a nobody, so who I am is not important.

180
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,879
What about 200,000 yuan?

181
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,639
You want me to betray my friend?

182
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,679
Dream on.

183
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,159
I'll call the police.

184
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,720
You're crazy.

185
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,279
What about 500,000 yuan? There's no rush.

186
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,039
You still have time to think.

187
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,039
Think about it and get back to me.

188
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,840
I'll tell you how it works.

189
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,240
This guy is crazy.

190
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,919
This world is full of crazy people.

191
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,879
Five hundred thousand?

192
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,279
Where was I?

193
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,039
I'm going to see a pretty lady soon.

194
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,919
Aren't you jealous?

195
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,639
There's a lot of food. Why would I be jealous?

196
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,639
You're not even jealous. I did all this for nothing.

197
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,759
Can't you be more mature?

198
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,679
Stop playing these childish games.

199
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,840
I want to be a grown-up too.

200
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,559
I wish I could be more aggressive.

201
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,440
But you're too strong.

202
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,519
I can't beat you.

203
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,039
- I went on a blind date that day. - What happened?

204
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,279
I like that guy so much.

205
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,399
He has chives in his mouth and teeth.

206
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,679
Kid, your playmate is here.

207
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
You like that kind of guy?

208
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,159
Don't you think men like that are so cool?

209
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,159
How is that cool?

210
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,159
You have a fetish.

211
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,279
But I think being low-class suits you well.

212
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,799
It really suits you well.

213
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,960
You should have removed the chives for him.

214
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,279
Doesn't it suit you?

215
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,960
- Your dad will die from laughing. - Ladies.

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm Hou Jue.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,559
He's handsome.

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,799
Well...

219
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,840
It has been a while, Chen Chen.

220
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,159
Hello.

221
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,759
I'm not Chen Chen. She is.

222
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,600
It has been a while. I didn't recognize you.

223
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm not Chen Chen either. She is.

224
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,080
Then...

225
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,799
Hello.

226
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,480
Stop acting. She's Chen Chen.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,159
It doesn't matter.

228
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,159
Have a seat.

229
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,159
One course meal, please.

230
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,360
Okay.

231
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,000
Since neither of you is Chen Chen,

232
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
I must have mistaken you for someone else.

233
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,919
I'll leave you to talk.

234
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,960
I'll get going.

235
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,919
What's happening?

236
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,279
Stop.

237
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,360
Sit down.

238
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,480
That's right.

239
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,679
Ms. Chen.

240
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,360
Why do you think that I'm Chen Chen?

241
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,600
When I see you being so unreasonable,

242
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,879
I immediately recall my miserable childhood.

243
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
It has been so many years,

244
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,960
but you haven't changed one bit.

245
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,159
What do you know?

246
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,519
I call it good quality and I'm promoting it.

247
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Good quality?

248
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
You'll never get to experience...

249
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,000
- my best trait. - Yes.

250
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,279
Let me introduce you to my best friends,

251
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,399
- Li Li and Coco. - Hi.

252
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,799
Hi, Li Li and Coco.

253
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
I don't understand.

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,879
Didn't you two grow up together?

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,399
Why couldn't you recognize her?

256
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,240
It's not my fault...

257
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,039
that I couldn't recognize her.

258
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,679
Chen Chen was very pretty when she was little.

259
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,919
As she's getting older,

260
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,279
- she's more... - What?

261
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,639
She's looking more and more feminine.

262
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,559
You have a way with words.

263
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,759
But it's completely ruined by her temper.

264
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,360
Do you want to never find a girlfriend?

265
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,759
It's my problem.

266
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,399
You're the problem. You're truly problematic.

267
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,519
It's scones.

268
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,679
It's my favorite.

269
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,440
You're cheating again. Are you not on a diet anymore?

270
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,360
I'll just go to the spa later.

271
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
You have never changed.

272
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,039
Will you please behave as if you have seen the world?

273
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,279
Are you really not going to eat?

274
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,600
No, thank you.

275
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,639
Eat it.

276
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,200
You should eat too.

277
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,159
- Then you have to feed me. - Don't eat too much.

278
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,039
That's not a good idea.

279
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,960
Why not?

280
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Is it really okay?

281
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,399
I don't think it's appropriate.

282
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,039
- Are you really not going to eat? - It's not bad.

283
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,320
- Eat up. - No.

284
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,399
I didn't know they serve this here.

285
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,679
- It's delicious. - Eat less.

286
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,120
Sure, go ahead.

287
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,759
- Are we meeting at 2pm tomorrow? - Yes, it's just me and you.

288
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,000
You really won't go to the spa with me?

289
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,879
Ma'am, I'm going to work.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Okay, I'll let you off today.

291
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,720
Thank you.

292
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm leaving.

293
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,399
Isn't that the lady who was sitting next to you?

294
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,679
Did you hire a female driver?

295
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,679
She's not a driver.

296
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,679
She's my bodyguard.

297
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,000
You're such a show-off.

298
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,799
Why did you bring a bodyguard on a date?

299
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,519
It's not just for the date.

300
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,840
It's 24 hours of close protection.

301
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Close protection?

302
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
How?

303
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,360
She sticks by my side every day.

304
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
You should get to know her.

305
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,399
Let me introduce you to her.

306
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,919
This is Ms. Chen Chen.

307
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,960
This is Wu Shi Yi.

308
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Hello.

309
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,240
I've been busy lately.

310
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,320
Take good care of him for me.

311
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,720
I'll do my job.

312
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm leaving, Hou Jue.

313
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,639
Isn't she interesting?

314
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Give me a comment.

315
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
A good match.

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,039
A good match?

317
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,839
Dad.

318
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,599
Dad.

319
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,650
Dad, why do you keep sleeping?

320
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,839
Were you born in the Year of the Pig?

321
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,200
Lying here is just the best.

322
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,839
How was it?

323
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,720
How do you feel?

324
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,240
What do you mean?

325
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,890
What are you talking about, Dad? I don't understand.

326
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,410
Don't play dumb with me.

327
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,920
It's...

328
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,920
It's so-so.

329
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,720
How is it so-so?

330
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,839
What's the reason?

331
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,319
Dad, I'm telling you. I almost didn't recognize him today.

332
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,519
Do you remember he was chubby when he was a kid?

333
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,599
What happened to him?

334
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,359
He's quite handsome now.

335
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,890
Chen Chen, you don't say.

336
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,650
He was chubby when his mom was alive.

337
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,720
After his mom left,

338
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,960
he went through a lot.

339
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,240
Dad, are you going to have a meeting with Mr. Hou soon?

340
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,599
- Yes. How did you know? - Tell him...

341
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,410
I think...

342
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,039
this is going to work.

343
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,279
And I agree to him wooing me.

344
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,759
That's great.

345
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,240
Actually, Chen Chen,

346
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,920
I have been worrying...

347
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
that you didn't like blind dates.

348
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,759
What did you say? How is that a blind date?

349
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,170
We've known each other since we were little.

350
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,119
No matter what,

351
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,839
we were childhood sweethearts.

352
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,039
You're right.

353
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
If you two become a couple,

354
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,319
then the business relationship between his dad and me...

355
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,000
can take another step forward.

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,200
Dad, you're talking...

357
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,890
as if something is going on between us.

358
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,960
It's too early for that.

359
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,000
You should work hard toward a bright future.

360
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,650
But let me be clear.

361
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,720
I'm merely...

362
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,799
giving him the right to pursue me.

363
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,599
It's just a qualification, okay?

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,170
That's right.

365
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,279
You're my precious daughter.

366
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,119
I'll do whatever you say.

367
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,890
But he's a good kid.

368
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,440
That's enough.

369
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,799
Dad, just drink your tea, okay?

370
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,440
Now that I've reported it, I'm leaving.

371
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,519
I'm done with your yammering.

372
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,799
- Bye. - All right.

373
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,559
Ma Yong.

374
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,720
Gather and send me the agendas of the meeting.

375
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,170
- Okay. - I want to see it in the evening.

376
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,170
Okay.

377
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,359
Mr. Hou, you have attended meetings for the whole day.

378
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,890
You should go home and rest.

379
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,650
If you're tense all the time,

380
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,650
you will break down soon.

381
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,279
I'm the only one at home.

382
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,000
What else can I do other than work?

383
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,000
You can raise a pet.

384
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
I have two dogs.

385
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,519
I would play with them for a bit every time I go home.

386
00:19:58,519 --> 00:19:59,680
It relieves stress.

387
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,410
A pet?

388
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,519
You're welcome.

389
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,279
I'm happy because you're happy.

390
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
What are you doing?

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,279
I'm thinking about someone.

392
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,000
Take a guess who he is.

393
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,279
I'm at a loss. What should I do?

394
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,650
Please tell me.

395
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,410
I want to tell you in person.

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,240
Okay. See you at the usual place.

397
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,279
Goodness.

398
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,480
Don't you know that I have heart disease?

399
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,200
Have you waited that long?

400
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,890
No.

401
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,920
You take care of your family during the day.

402
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
I didn't expect you to be so energetic at night.

403
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't want to go to bed.

404
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,799
Why?

405
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,839
I'm afraid if I fall asleep,

406
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,559
I won't feel this happy anymore.

407
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,359
Silly girl, this is just the beginning.

408
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,079
The good times are yet to come.

409
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,119
But why do I think that none of this feels real?

410
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,160
How is this unreal?

411
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,559
You're going to live like this for the rest of your life.

412
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,720
Do you know?

413
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,319
When I was little,

414
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,240
I was quite outstanding in my hometown.

415
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,400
I did well in school.

416
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,240
I was a class representative.

417
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,400
I was tall and I did sports.

418
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,279
Everyone in my hometown said...

419
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,799
that I would be really successful one day.

420
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,960
Only when I came to the city...

421
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,400
did I realize there were so many outstanding people.

422
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,160
And I'm not that outstanding.

423
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,359
So I've been working really hard.

424
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,079
My parents visited me two days ago.

425
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,039
When I saw how happy they were,

426
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,200
I realized something.

427
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,079
I didn't know that I've been working so hard...

428
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,000
because I wanted them to be happy.

429
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,680
Old man.

430
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Thank you.

431
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,279
Why are you thanking me?

432
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,279
You give me a life I never dared to dream of.

433
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,160
I'm so overwhelmed by all this.

434
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,119
I thought your dream...

435
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,680
was to go to the moon.

436
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,440
A small dream like yours should come true.

437
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,359
I thought a girl like you...

438
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,759
would probably have...

439
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,440
a very romantic dream.

440
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,880
My dream is romantic too.

441
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,240
It's just that I think...

442
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,960
I might not necessarily be happy...

443
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,759
when I'm on the receiving end.

444
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,640
That's because it's from me.

445
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,119
But now,

446
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm exceptionally happy.

447
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,759
You have a beautiful smile.

448
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,079
The city is beautiful after it rains.

449
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,480
It's because you're in a good mood.

450
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,880
It's true.

451
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,279
You know what?

452
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,759
In the past few days,

453
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,480
the happiest thing for me...

454
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,599
was sparring with you...

455
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,720
and looking at your texts.

456
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,519
Apart from work,

457
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,440
my life was dull in general.

458
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,799
I was so bored.

459
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,200
At my age,

460
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,400
there aren't many fun things.

461
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,319
Sometimes, I don't even remember...

462
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,200
what laughing felt like.

463
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,240
I didn't know how to laugh anymore.

464
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,920
But when I met you,

465
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,680
I thought you were my angel.

466
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,960
When you're by my side,

467
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,440
I know how to laugh.

468
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,519
And I think that every cell in my body...

469
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,519
is resurrected.

470
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,079
My body feels so light and alive.

471
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,319
I didn't know I was that good.

472
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,880
Of course.

473
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:23,920
Promise me.

474
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,640
Don't leave me, okay?

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,559
I don't want to lose you.

476
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,839
I'm serious.

477
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,480
I don't want to lose you.

478
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,720
Qian Qian, I can give you...

479
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,039
the life you want.

480
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,720
Maybe something even better than the life you dreamed of.

481
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,559
It's true.

482
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,039
Why don't you quit your job?

483
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,039
I think that job...

484
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,920
is too tiring and dangerous for you.

485
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,559
Would that be okay?

486
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,559
If I quit my job,

487
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,480
what can I do?

488
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,319
I have your best interests at heart.

489
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,799
Why don't you move to the villa now?

490
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,039
I'll buy you a car that you like.

491
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:15,440
From now on, you can start your dream life.

492
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,759
If you're unhappy living in the villa...

493
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,480
or if you feel lonely,

494
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,440
you can take your family with you.

495
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,160
You can let them move in too.

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,279
Then all of you can live happily.

497
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,240
Won't that be great?

498
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:30,119
You can even take them out.

499
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,720
You can go anywhere.

500
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,160
You can show them around the world.

501
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,559
You can go to the US, Europe,

502
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,680
or anywhere you like.

503
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,440
I'm happy as long as you're happy.

504
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,839
Okay?

505
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,200
I'll think about it.

506
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,480
Will you stop thinking?

507
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,279
My heart turned cold when you said you would think about it.

508
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,839
What's wrong?

509
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,000
Monkey, I'm in trouble.

510
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,359
My car fell into the river. It won't turn on.

511
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,599
Come and save me. Hurry.

512
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,759
In that case, you should call for help.

513
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,279
- Why are you looking for me? - Are you going to pay for it?

514
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,599
Besides, the car would have sank by the time they reach.

515
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,720
Hurry up. Come on.

516
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,119
I'm busy.

517
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,079
Busy with what? Come and help me. Come on.

518
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,519
Hurry up.

519
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,559
Beg me nicely.

520
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,799
I'm sorry. I'm begging you, buddy.

521
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm begging you. Please come quickly.

522
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
Just wait there.

523
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,519
It's raining.

524
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Hello?

525
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
Where are you?

526
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,480
We're almost there. Don't rush me.

527
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,680
We're on our way.

528
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,680
Hold on. We're almost there.

529
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,920
I didn't notice when I called earlier.

530
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,279
My car has slipped into the water.

531
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,680
If you don't come out now,

532
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,240
it will disappear into thin air and never be seen again.

533
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,319
All right, that's enough.

534
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,559
Save the battery.

535
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,400
I won't be able to reach you if your phone is dead.

536
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,759
Can you try to be as efficient as when you're saving others?

537
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,079
Or else, you'll never see me again. Hurry up!

538
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,079
All right, I understand.

539
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,119
I'm hanging up.

540
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,200
If it weren't for Hai Xing,

541
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,839
we wouldn't have had the chance...

542
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,759
to travel in the storm.

543
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,240
It feels quite romantic, doesn't it?

544
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,400
It's too bad that it's raining heavily.

545
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:38,519
I'm fine. Hurry and help me get my car out.

546
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,799
I'll take care of it tomorrow. Get in the car first.

547
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,079
No way. It will turn into a total loss by tomorrow.

548
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:43,119
We've been together for 10 years.

549
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,599
Your engine is completely submerged. It's beyond salvage.

550
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,599
No way! I'm with my car no matter what.

551
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,839
Help, Monkey!

552
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,279
What are you doing? Help me!

553
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,799
What are you doing?

554
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,759
Give me a hand. Don't just stand there, okay?

555
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,559
Hou Jue.

556
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,000
Take it.

557
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,039
Control it and I'll drive.

558
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,799
Get the rope. Don't just stand there!

559
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,559
Help me out!

560
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,799
Help!

561
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,480
Go!

562
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,720
Go!

563
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,319
Activate the winch!

564
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,680
Activate the winch!

565
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Come on.

566
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Have some water.

567
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,839
Here.

568
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Have a seat.

569
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,119
I'm afraid of water.

570
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,160
I can see that.

571
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,839
It's nothing.

572
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,880
A lot of people are afraid of water.

573
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,759
Some people are afraid of the water.

574
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,079
Some are afraid of heights.

575
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,440
Some are afraid of snakes.

576
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,680
Anyway,

577
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,880
everyone has a weakness.

578
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,559
My mom...

579
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,920
died in the water.

580
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I was there with her.

581
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,000
That's why I'm afraid of water...

582
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,319
for an inexplicable reason.

583
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,960
I can't get over it.

584
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,359
My mom sacrificed herself...

585
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,039
to save me.

586
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,759
So my mom gave me life twice.

587
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,599
In danger,

588
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,079
the first thing a mom always does is to save her child.

589
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,039
I guess it's a mother's instinct.

590
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,359
I had never...

591
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,000
talked about this.

592
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,400
It's something I can't let go of.

593
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,759
I can't resolve it.

594
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,079
I wanted to talk about it,

595
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,200
but I just couldn't.

596
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,960
But I told you today.

597
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,240
It turns out...

598
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,720
it's not that hard.

599
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,559
Every day,

600
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,119
when I'm in bed late at night,

601
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,119
the moment I close my eyes,

602
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,079
the image in the water...

603
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,960
would show up before my eyes...

604
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,289
like a movie.

605
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
It really hurts sometimes.

606
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's why you often can't sleep at night.

607
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,599
So you get up and work.

608
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,199
Yes.

609
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,159
I thought I might need...

610
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,769
to do something else...

611
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,440
to distract myself.

612
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,199
That's why you decided to become a rescuer.

613
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
I think...

614
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,880
that being a rescuer...

615
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,440
is my responsibility for life.

616
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,719
I feel like deep down,

617
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,289
I have the desire to help people.

618
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,559
I can't help it.

619
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,559
I hope I can be of help to everyone within my reach.

620
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:00,000
Even though I can't do much,

621
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,329
I do my best and give it my all.

622
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,039
I wish I could save...

623
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,239
every life that can be saved.

624
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,079
If you asked me yesterday what happiness is,

625
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,960
I would say I don't know.

626
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,599
If you ask me what happiness is today,

627
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,719
I'll tell you...

628
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,559
happiness is when your childhood dream life...

629
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,039
became reality.

630
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,199
I'm living my dream now.

631
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,480
Thank you.

632
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:19,960
(Moments)

633
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,599
How is it, Liu Er?

634
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:40,119
What happened?

635
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,199
Did you use it as a boat?

636
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,519
Don't get me started.

637
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,769
I went to the mountains yesterday to buy something.

638
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,289
But there was heavy rain when I came back.

639
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,000
I pulled over to wait for the rain to stop.

640
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,199
I didn't expect my car to slip into the river.

641
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,119
You didn't take the expressway again.

642
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,559
Don't you know how much it costs to travel?

643
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,559
I only make so little profit.

644
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't want to spend it on the expressway.

645
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,119
Don't be silly.

646
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,039
The gas money is more expensive than the expressway fees.

647
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,329
Why are you everywhere? Go and sweep the floor.

648
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,079
You're not listening.

649
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,719
Mr. Liu.

650
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Mr. Liu.

651
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,559
I'm good.

652
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,329
Please fix it.

653
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,039
Is there still hope?

654
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,329
I'll take it back and check.

655
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,079
I think...

656
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:23,329
there is not much hope.

657
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,679
Don't say that.

658
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,039
Well...

659
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,719
It means a lot to me.

660
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:30,840
It's not just a car.

661
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,840
It has been with me for years.

662
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,199
We're like twin brothers.

663
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,480
Please take it seriously, okay?

664
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,119
Well...

665
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
It's our job to help people.

666
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,769
But the cost of repair...

667
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,440
should be enough for you to buy a new twin brother.

668
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,809
Sir, get me the cheapest one.

669
00:38:58,809 --> 00:38:59,809
- It's fine as long as it works. - A cheaper one?

670
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:00,809
Can I try?

671
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,679
- It's okay. - Can you slot the card in for me?

672
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,809
- Can I try? - Okay.

673
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yes, you can.

674
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,920
Thank you.

675
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,239
I'm fine as long as the phone works.

676
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,400
It's too expensive.

677
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,480
Most of them are glorious but not practical.

678
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,639
We should spend money wisely, right?

679
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,809
Look at that.

680
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,329
They all look the same,

681
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:16,440
but that one is so expensive.

682
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,360
- Okay. - Thank you.

683
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,329
That's good.

684
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,639
WeChat is already installed on the phone, right?

685
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,329
- It's all there. - Can I log in first?

686
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,000
- Yes. - In case someone is looking for me.

687
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:29,920
My phone has been wet for two days.

688
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,639
Monkey.

689
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,960
Have you seen Qian Qian's WeChat Moments?

690
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,159
No. What did she say?

691
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,809
She's showing off that she's happy.

692
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:51,809
Look at her.

693
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:52,920
I was in trouble yesterday.

694
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,960
Can't she block me?

695
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,840
It's the least she can do.

696
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:58,329
There is no need for courtesy. She doesn't care about you at all.

697
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,559
Why are you taking it so seriously?

698
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,559
I'll take a look.

699
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,679
I'm upset.

700
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,519
Qian Qian...

701
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,880
is really something.

702
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,079
Isn't this a villa with a sea view?

703
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,719
I think my dad has a house there too.

704
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:19,809
That's nice.

705
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,639
Did Qian Qin tell you who that man is?

706
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,159
No.

707
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,769
I only know that he's her type.

708
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:34,400
What if Hai Xing threatens to kill himself every day?

709
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,719
Qian Qian seems serious this time.

710
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,960
When this is all over,

711
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,119
Hai Xing will give up then.

712
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,880
I feel sorry for Hai Xing.

713
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,480
I feel sorry for Qian Qian.

714
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,400
It's not easy to find someone you like.

715
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,239
It's not easy for anyone.

716
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,519
Who can find someone they like?

717
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,920
It's not easy for anyone.

718
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,599
Yes, it's not easy for anyone.
