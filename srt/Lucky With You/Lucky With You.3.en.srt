4
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,040
Mr. Hou.

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
What is it?

6
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,319
You hired her.

7
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Do you like it?

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,599
What is there to like?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,159
On the face of it, she was hired as an assistant,

10
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,159
but in reality, she's a bodyguard...

11
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,760
whom I hired for you from a security company.

12
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,359
On the face of it,

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,840
you hired a bodyguard for me,

14
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,480
but in reality, you found someone...

15
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,159
to watch me around the clock.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,759
Can you ask for my opinion before making any decisions?

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,090
Don't just change my life as you please, okay?

18
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,120
There was an intruder.

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
Someone is looking for revenge.

20
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,759
They are the ones who want to change your life,

21
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,759
not me.

22
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,319
Who is looking for revenge?

23
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you think this matter is over just because that person...

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
didn't go to Pier 5?

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,370
If he didn't get money from me,

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,199
do you think he would've stood you up?

27
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,090
Mr. Hou.

28
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,370
You sure are well-informed.

29
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,039
Let me tell you.

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,800
They didn't change my life.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,280
That is my life.

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,759
I'm in charge.

33
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,919
Please stop interfering.

34
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,759
Let me tell you this too.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,319
Keeping you safe...

36
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
is to keep the family's future successor safe.

37
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,240
Don't interfere with my decision either.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,759
Shi Yi, take him out.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Tell me. What will make you leave?

40
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,840
I'll only leave if I get fired...

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
for neglecting my duty and failing to protect you...

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,759
as stated in my contract.

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
That's too troublesome.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,919
How about this?

45
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll double the salary that Mr. Hou is offering you.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Go and protect someone else.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
It’s done. Just check it over.

48
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,639
So you don't agree.

49
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,759
Then don't blame me for not showing you mercy.

50
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,280
Please close the door from the outside.

51
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,719
Okay.

52
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,599
Hello.

53
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,800
Coffee, please.

54
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,919
Okay, one second.

55
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,759
Here's your coffee.

56
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,519
Wait.

57
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,519
What kind of coffee is this?

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,959
Get me a cup of pour-over coffee.

59
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,170
Okay.

60
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,000
Here is your pour-over coffee.

61
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,519
Wait a minute.

62
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
Come back here.

63
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,800
Do you know how to make pour-over coffee?

64
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,170
This isn't hot enough.

65
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,170
The coffee beans aren't emitting the aroma it's supposed to have.

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
Okay, I'll get you another cup.

67
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,279
Here is your coffee. Are you satisfied?

68
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,610
It's cold.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll get you a hot one.

70
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,639
It has been warmed.

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,199
What do you mean by that?

72
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,439
Did you microwave it?

73
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,959
Can coffee be heated up?

74
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you have the least bit of respect for this cup of coffee?

75
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,959
Why don't I get you another cup?

76
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,519
I don't want to drink it anymore.

77
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,759
My mood has been ruined for the entire day.

78
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,279
Are you...

79
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,800
the Wu Shi Yi who fights and uses weapons?

80
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,079
That is me.

81
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,720
If I do anything wrong,

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
please let me know.

83
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,600
Don't you have quite a hot temper?

84
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,360
Why the sudden change of heart?

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,319
Did you take some medicine this morning?

86
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,480
You're suddenly so gentle and virtuous.

87
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,240
Thank you for the acknowledgment.

88
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,519
Is there anything else you need?

89
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,639
Why are you smiling at me?

90
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,319
I'm keeping a smile on my face.

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
There's nothing else.

92
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,879
Just call me if you need anything.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll head out now.

94
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,319
Wait.

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,759
Take this coffee away.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Okay.

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,079
Let's see how long you'll keep saying "okay".

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,279
Actually,

99
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,279
I'm quite curious...

100
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,279
about the bodyguard industry.

101
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,800
Since you're my bodyguard now,

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,800
give me a detailed introduction about yourself.

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Me?

104
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,800
I have been a bodyguard for seven years.

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,759
I used to be a Sanda athlete.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Is that it?

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
That's it.

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,319
Who are you trying to fool?

109
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,519
I asked for a detailed introduction.

110
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
What the heck is this?

111
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,839
Let me ask you.

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,959
Who was the person...

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,480
you jumped off the building to chase last time?

114
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,519
No one. It was a training mission.

115
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,959
Were you guys training to jump off a building, chase after a weak man,

116
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,040
and beat him up?

117
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,040
Don't be shy.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Just tell me. It's okay.

119
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
He was your boyfriend, wasn't he?

120
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,360
Just tell me. I understand.

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,879
We're going to be spending a lot of time together, right?

122
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,120
Communicating more will help us get along.

123
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,800
Is being your boyfriend also considered a high-risk career?

124
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,040
You always resort to violence.

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
He must get beaten up often...

126
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
and probably doesn't dare to say anything.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
What are you doing?

128
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,639
Are you okay?

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Get out of the car.

130
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,439
You just hit someone. Get out.

131
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,879
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,720
- Are you okay? - How could you drive like that?

133
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,840
You hit my buddy.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,159
Tell us. How are you going to compensate him?

135
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,039
- Well... - I'm the driver, so talk to me.

136
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,450
Just 20,000 yuan.

137
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,120
Give us 20,000 yuan and we'll leave right away.

138
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
You're scamming us, aren't you?

139
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,210
They're scammers.

140
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,879
You're trying to scam us, aren't you? Look at you.

141
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,039
I guess you're lucky that you ran into me.

142
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,279
I won't compensate you. What are you going to do?

143
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,559
- What will you do about it? - Who are you calling a scammer?

144
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,960
You grabbed my collar. Do you want to fight me?

145
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,799
Do you want to fight?

146
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Get in the car.

147
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,919
Don't use violence. Talk nicely.

148
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,840
You're so nosy.

149
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,159
Not bad.

150
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
You're good.

151
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,360
That hurts. Pretty girl, that hurts.

152
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,240
It hurts.

153
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,210
She’s no ordinary girl.

154
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,480
They aren't scammers, are they?

155
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,840
What's happening?

156
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,330
That girl is such a good fighter.

157
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,210
They're leaving. It's over.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Not bad. You've got some moves.

159
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,120
Amazing.

160
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,720
Help me apologize to those buddies of yours.

161
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,090
What buddies?

162
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,519
Which ones?

163
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,450
When we were turning just now,

164
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,720
I saw an Angel Rescue Team car.

165
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:24,600
Your profile says you're a member of the Angel Rescue Team.

166
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,450
Is that so?

167
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,799
Were my team members there?

168
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
I didn't see them.

169
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,279
The one who was lying on the floor just now was wearing rescue boots.

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,360
Also, there were cable marks between the thumb...

171
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,559
and index finger on the hands of the two guys who hit you.

172
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,919
You have them too.

173
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,559
Also, I could feel...

174
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,120
that they didn't really want to hit you.

175
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,210
Do you want me to continue?

176
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
There's no need.

177
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,679
I was just testing you to see...

178
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,240
if you would really protect me.

179
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
It turns out you're not bad.

180
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,759
Your foundation is pretty good.

181
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,240
Are you able to take care of anything for me?

182
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,799
If I think of it this way,

183
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,240
I'm quite happy to have someone like you.

184
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
My job is to protect you,

185
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,840
not to hurt other people.

186
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
I was just asking.

187
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,399
Drop me off at that hotel up front. I need to use the bathroom.

188
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,879
We'll be home soon.

189
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,480
I need to go now. I can't hold it anymore.

190
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,279
Please stop the car.

191
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,919
Hey.

192
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,919
Hold it in for a bit.

193
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Stop!

194
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm coming.

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What are you doing? Slow down.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm going to the bathroom. I've been holding it in for too long.

197
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,200
Your shoes!

198
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,480
You never take off your shoes. Gosh.

199
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,480
Hello, ma'am. I'm Wu Shi Yi.

200
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,679
I know.

201
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,879
Hou Jue's dad told me over the phone.

202
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,200
Just call me Ms. Zhang.

203
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,240
If there's anything you need...

204
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
or you don't understand here,

205
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
you can just ask me.

206
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,799
- Thank you. - Let me know if you need anything.

207
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,440
Look. I even especially prepared a pair of slippers for you.

208
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
I brought my own.

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You even brought your own pair?

210
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll wear this.

211
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
It's convenient to wear at home.

212
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
They fit perfectly and it won't affect my work.

213
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,519
You can't even relax at home.

214
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,440
I've tidied up your room.

215
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,639
I'll show you.

216
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,519
Can I check around the place first?

217
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,799
Check?

218
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,919
Sure.

219
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,919
Feel free to check.

220
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,679
I clean it several times a day.

221
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,480
- It's clean everywhere. - Okay.

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Let me do it.

223
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,960
- Come on. Go and check. - Thank you.

224
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Please.

225
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,080
Hey!

226
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
Don't touch that painting!

227
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,519
Hands off.

228
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,759
What are you doing?

229
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,480
- You just won't stop, will you? - She's working. Gosh.

230
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,879
I'm sorry. This is my work procedure.

231
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,960
No safety checks have been done...

232
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
after someone broke into this place.

233
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I have to check...

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,399
whether there are any recording devices or cameras.

235
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,879
There's no need for that.

236
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,679
Get out right now. Just keep watch at the door.

237
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,600
- Go. - What are you doing?

238
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,399
Ms. Zhang, this room is...

239
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,799
It's the study.

240
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
What are you doing?

241
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,159
Stop it, I'm telling you.

242
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,279
- Come out. - That's enough.

243
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,279
Come out!

244
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,159
What are you doing?

245
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,399
She's working.

246
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,159
Let me ask you. Can she protect you?

247
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,960
Who knows? She's just a poser.

248
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,559
How can you say that?

249
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,679
I'm telling you.

250
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,039
If she can really protect you, then that's great.

251
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,879
Let's see who dares to barge in here again.

252
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,320
If anyone breaks in, she'll...

253
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
She'll beat him up.

254
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,279
Are you done looking?

255
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Come out.

256
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,360
- It never ends. - Who is it?

257
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
The person I called is here.

258
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,200
What?

259
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,039
Did you call someone? Who did you call?

260
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,799
Hi, miss. We're here to install security cameras.

261
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,799
Here's my employee ID.

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
- Come in. - Okay.

263
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
Wait. What security cameras?

264
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,759
Who asked you to install security cameras?

265
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
I suggested it to Mr. Hou.

266
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
He thinks it's necessary.

267
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
I don't think it's necessary.

268
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
There's no need to install them. Go.

269
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,559
It's just a precaution.

270
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,679
What if a stranger comes in...

271
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,639
or some people...

272
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,399
go out when they shouldn't?

273
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,279
You're the stranger. Don't you know that?

274
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,840
What are you saying?

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
You're so annoying. Stop talking.

276
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I think we should install the cameras.

277
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,279
I'll feel more at ease that way.

278
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,279
How could you be at ease?

279
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,399
Who installs security cameras in their own house?

280
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,399
It's awkward.

281
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,559
Shi Yi, you...

282
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,480
Who will watch the security cameras?

283
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Just me.

284
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,759
That's right.

285
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,879
Only Shi Yi will watch them. What's the big deal?

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,039
She's looking at you right now. Why don't you feel awkward?

287
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,759
Yet you find it uncomfortable when she's watching you on cameras?

288
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,879
I still don't want them.

289
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,879
Installing security cameras at home?

290
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,679
Are you crazy? Privacy. You...

291
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,720
Do you understand what privacy is?

292
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
Do you know privacy?

293
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,399
Who installs security cameras at home?

294
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,399
All right.

295
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,960
Privacy?

296
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,720
I've been cleaning up your poop ever since you were young.

297
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,879
What privacy do you have?

298
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Gosh.

299
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,279
Don't worry.

300
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,600
There won't be cameras in every corner.

301
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
- Okay. - That still won't do.

302
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,799
No. You can't install them.

303
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,840
You can't. Do you understand?

304
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,120
You can't install them. Do you hear me?

305
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,399
If you install them today, I'll take them down. Do you hear me?

306
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,320
Take them down then.

307
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,480
Should we still install them?

308
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,360
Of course. Come in.

309
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,240
Shi Yi, I'll let you get busy.

310
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,320
- I'll clean up in the kitchen. - Okay.

311
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,840
Put one in that corner to see the entire living room.

312
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay, no problem.

313
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,879
Also,

314
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,320
put one in that corner of the study.

315
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Okay.

316
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,279
Install one in this corner of the dining room.

317
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,960
- It has to see the main door. - Okay.

318
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Over here too.

319
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
In this corner,

320
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,240
the camera needs to see the entire hallway.

321
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,399
Okay.

322
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,399
Thank you.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And over here.

324
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,480
Put one in this corner.

325
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,879
It should see the area of these three doors.

326
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,960
No. I told you not to install them. Do you not understand?

327
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,080
Now, you're even installing one at my door?

328
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,279
You can't. Do you understand?

329
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,279
Hou Jue.

330
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,920
What?

331
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Come here.

332
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,680
Don't disturb other people's work.

333
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,920
Do you hear me?

334
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
Come here.

335
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,410
What are you doing?

336
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,599
Three.

337
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,039
Don't install them, okay?

338
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,039
Don't install the cameras.

339
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,410
Two.

340
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
I'm coming.

341
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,759
What is it?

342
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,119
- Come here. - I'm coming. What is it?

343
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
- Come here. - I'm here.

344
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,319
After you've installed them,

345
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,890
the signal has to connect to my phone and my laptop.

346
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
- I want a shared connection. - Okay, no problem.

347
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,039
- Okay. - You can start now.

348
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,200
Miss, take a look at your phone.

349
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,480
The data is connected to your phone now.

350
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,839
The camera in the study is installed.

351
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,960
Can the sock cover it?

352
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,599
The picture quality is quite clear.

353
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,440
- Thank you. - It's our pleasure.

354
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,359
Hands down.

355
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,359
Hands down. Stand still.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,680
Suck in your stomach. Look up. That's it.

357
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Stand up straight.

358
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,319
Stand still. Don't move.

359
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,359
What are you doing?

360
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,200
- Ms. Zhang, are you going home? - Yes.

361
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,410
I've already arranged what you asked for.

362
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
- Okay, I'll get going then. Bye. - Okay, bye.

363
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,170
How dare he block me?

364
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Here.

365
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,440
- Thank you, Ms. Zhang. - Have some fruit.

366
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
You're welcome.

367
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,519
Ms. Zhang.

368
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,920
Why is there a painting in the living room...

369
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,079
instead of a television?

370
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,440
Hou Jue won't let me put a television here.

371
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,890
Didn't you see...

372
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,410
how he just looks at this painting like it's a television?

373
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,559
Thank you.

374
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,759
Does this painting hold a special meaning?

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,079
This painting...

376
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,960
is of him and his mom.

377
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,240
I saw in his file...

378
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,480
that his mom passed away when he was very young.

379
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,410
Yes.

380
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,650
That year,

381
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,410
his mom took him out on an errand.

382
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,319
She got into a car accident...

383
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,759
and drove the car into a river.

384
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,480
His mom did all she could to lift him up.

385
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,279
But his mom...

386
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,200
He was only five years old back then.

387
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,410
But he already started to have memories.

388
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,039
That must have had a big impact on him.

389
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,599
Exactly.

390
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,559
He has grown up now,

391
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,240
but he still hasn't gotten over it.

392
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,319
He may joke around and seem carefree all the time,

393
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,799
but actually,

394
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,119
deep down, he is in pain.

395
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Mom.

396
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,680
Where are you?

397
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
I'm at my client's place.

398
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,319
Let me ask you. What happened to Zhu Da Peng?

399
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,920
I made the arrangements for his cousin's internship,

400
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
but he blocked me.

401
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,960
What's the meaning of this?

402
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,440
We broke up.

403
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
You broke up?

404
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,650
Is it because of your dad?

405
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,359
No, he had nothing to do with it.

406
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,799
I don't believe you.

407
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
What happened? Tell me.

408
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,960
All right. I'll bring my dad into the call too.

409
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,799
I'll tell you both at the same time, so I don't have to say it twice.

410
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,079
This is rare.

411
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:04,799
Why is your face swollen?

412
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,119
You're the one with the swollen face.

413
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,759
I'm just too close to the lens, so my face is distorted.

414
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,720
Now that you're both here,

415
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,279
let me officially tell you this.

416
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,720
- I broke up with Zhu Da Peng. - You broke up?

417
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Why?

418
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,279
We're incompatible.

419
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,480
Being incompatible isn't a reason.

420
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Why can't that be a reason?

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,519
If your personalities are really incompatible,

422
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,559
you must break up.

423
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,599
You absolutely can't settle.

424
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,160
- It's not about compatibility. - Was there a third party involved?

425
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,480
Two people being together is about relying on each other.

426
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,119
- Simplicity is what's real. - Then it's because of your dad.

427
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
I told you this long ago.

428
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,000
- Do you think I want to be in debt? - Having a burden like your dad...

429
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,039
- I'm a burden? - No one could stand it...

430
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,799
- as time passes. - What have you done for Shi Yi?

431
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,000
You're almost 30 and you're still living in your company dormitory.

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
- What kind of quality of life... - You threw her into sports teams...

433
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,240
- is that? - and just left her.

434
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,960
At least she met Da Peng through my superior.

435
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Can you two...

436
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,319
No, listen to me first, okay?

437
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,880
Zhu Da Peng and I simply had a normal breakup.

438
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,039
It's not that complicated. Don't think too much of it.

439
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,039
I have a new job now.

440
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,000
All of my focus is on my work now.

441
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,279
Don't worry about me, okay?

442
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,279
I'm done talking now. I have to go. Bye.

443
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,799
What are you doing?

444
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,599
I'm doing whatever you're doing.

445
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
I have something to do.

446
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,079
It's so late. You're off work.

447
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,079
Get some rest.

448
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,319
Hurry and go back.

449
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,519
Don't stare at me. It makes me uncomfortable.

450
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,599
What's the matter?

451
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,359
Are you okay?

452
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
You're off duty.

453
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,440
You're resting now, okay?

454
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,400
You can go back to sleep, okay?

455
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,079
Stay still.

456
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Don't move.

457
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,440
You're finally here. Hurry up.

458
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Come on.

459
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
It's right here.

460
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,480
Young Master Hou is here.

461
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,200
What's going on? Did you get a new girl?

462
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
What are you saying?

463
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,119
She's my new chauffeur.

464
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,119
A chauffeur?

465
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,799
Why did you get a female chauffeur?

466
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,319
What's wrong with a female chauffeur?

467
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,799
She is a champion racer.

468
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,599
She just retired, so I hired her.

469
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,480
- So she's an experienced driver. - Is that so?

470
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,000
- Not bad. - I'm going to look over there.

471
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Okay. Talk to you later.

472
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,680
Come on, Monkey.

473
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,079
Come here.

474
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What's happening?

475
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,000
What's going on?

476
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,519
Who is this? Introduce us.

477
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,880
This...

478
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,279
This is a distant relative of mine. Her name is Shi Yi.

479
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
You can even call her Shi San if you want.

480
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Shi San?

481
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,160
You can call her "Ms. Shi Yi".

482
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,880
- Ms. Shi Yi. - Hi, Ms. Shi Yi.

483
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,559
So she's a relative.

484
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,480
No wonder you two look a bit alike.

485
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
What? We look alike?

486
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,519
Are you talking about the fact that we both have eyes and noses?

487
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
Ms. Shi Yi, do you remember me?

488
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,839
Thank you for last time.

489
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,000
It was all thanks to you...

490
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,960
that our boy here didn't get beaten to death.

491
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,559
Let's officially get to know each other.

492
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,559
I'm Hai Xing.

493
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,720
Hai Xing as in "starry sea".

494
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,039
Hello, Ms. Shi Yi. I'm Xiao Dan.

495
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,039
Hello.

496
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,519
You sure change quickly.

497
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
- Stop spouting nonsense. - You act fast.

498
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Where's Ai Mi?

499
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,599
She just got an M5.

500
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,440
She kept bragging just now. Look at that attitude.

501
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,880
She is so arrogant.

502
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So that one is hers.

503
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Let's take a look.

504
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,039
Those were some weak parking skills.

505
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,160
Hey, man.

506
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,759
What's going on?

507
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,200
Isn't my car nice?

508
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Not bad.

509
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,880
I have to tell you about this car.

510
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,880
It has a 4.4-liter turbo with a V8 engine...

511
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
and 600 horsepower.

512
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,240
It can make up to 750Nm of torque.

513
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,279
It only takes 3.4 seconds to accelerate to 100km per hour.

514
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,799
Hao is about to start the challenge!

515
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,400
What's going on?

516
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,319
Hao is challenging himself to do an S-turn.

517
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Can he do it?

518
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,720
That was no good.

519
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,400
That was so bad. What happened?

520
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,160
Buddy, your skills weren't very good.

521
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Can you do it or not?

522
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Why don't you try?

523
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,119
- We'll pass, right? - Yes.

524
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,839
Ms. Champion.

525
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,640
- Show us how it's done. - Yes.

526
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
That's right.

527
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
- Show us. - She...

528
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,680
She's a champion in left-hand driving.

529
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,839
That's a right-hand drive car. She's not used to it.

530
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,599
- What if she breaks it? - You must be bluffing!

531
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,039
Why would I bluff?

532
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,279
I'll show you if you don't believe me.

533
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,039
- Come on! - Come on.

534
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,599
- Come on. - Come on.

535
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,680
We're doomed.

536
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,119
I haven't driven right-hand drive cars much either.

537
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,720
Don't bluff so much from now on.

538
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,839
It's a bit hard to do this turn as a beginner.

539
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,640
Floor the pedal at the start and release the hand brake.

540
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
After the car zooms out,

541
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,359
don't worry about whether you can make the first turn.

542
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,839
Just step on the clutch and steer the wheel.

543
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,039
- Buckle up. - Then...

544
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
Can you do it?

545
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,799
Dazzle them by making a U-turn first.

546
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,119
It's the basic.

547
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,839
This is the technique I can put into words for you.

548
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,839
Step on the clutch, pull the hand brake and steer.

549
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,400
- Do it at the same time. - Buckle up.

550
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I really do need to buckle up.

551
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,759
It's too dangerous if I don't.

552
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
My life is important.

553
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,359
Shi Yi, let me tell you.

554
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,839
Don't worry.

555
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,559
Don't be nervous. I'm here.

556
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,559
Don't be afraid.

557
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,759
You have some good driving skills.

558
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,400
Not bad. You're pretty good.

559
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,240
As my bodyguard,

560
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,200
not only did you not hide yourself...

561
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,599
and pretend to be invisible,

562
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,599
but you also went and stole...

563
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,599
the limelight from your employer...

564
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,039
and his friends.

565
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,640
Can I use that as a reason...

566
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,559
to file a complaint against you and fire you?

567
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,319
You can try.

568
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Okay.

569
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Attention all rescue units.

570
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,920
Attention all rescue units.

571
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,759
An old farmhouse residence building has collapsed.

572
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,039
The number of people trapped is unknown.

573
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,480
Come to the rescue immediately.

574
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Roger that.

575
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,599
Captain! Please send me the location.

576
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,119
I got it.

577
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,599
Preparing to depart.

578
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,160
Follow the navigator. Go as fast as possible.

579
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,359
(Angel Rescue)

580
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,119
Be careful, everyone.

581
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,039
Mom!

582
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,799
Mom!

583
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,279
Attention to all rescue team members.

584
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,599
The headquarters has announced...

585
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,200
that the rescue job is basically done.

586
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,839
To prevent a second collapse,

587
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,480
all members are to evacuate the scene now.

588
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,960
All members must evacuate the scene.

589
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
What's the situation?

590
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,920
- What took you so long? - There was traffic.

591
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,759
There's a risk of a second collapse now.

592
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
What about the inside?

593
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,359
Hold on.

594
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,519
Mr. Wang, please confirm with headquarters again...

595
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,359
whether everyone has been safely evacuated.

596
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,359
Okay.

597
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,680
Calling headquarters.

598
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,960
Please confirm whether everyone has been evacuated.

599
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,039
We'll know once we have a look inside.

600
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,039
Hold on!

601
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Wait! It's dangerous!

602
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Be careful!

603
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,319
Are you okay?

604
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,599
Why did you jump on me?

605
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,319
Hou Jue.

606
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Is this your girlfriend?

607
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,279
She beat us up pretty badly last time.

608
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,599
- That's right. - She's quite good.

609
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,960
Don't tell Ms. Zhang about my rescue job.

610
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
I don't want her to worry.

611
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,599
On the day I joined the rescue team,

612
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,679
I made a vow.

613
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,239
In the face of crisis,

614
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,960
I'll do all I can do to save people's lives.

615
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:01,289
So don't interfere with my rescue missions from now on.

616
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,289
Do you understand?

617
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,039
That's also our company's policy.

618
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:06,719
My job is to protect people,

619
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,039
but you're just a volunteer.

620
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,960
Shouldn't you think...

621
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,289
about your own safety before rescuing others?

622
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:14,289
Stop thinking about it.

623
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,079
As my bodyguard,

624
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,199
you and I need to be on the same page.

625
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,159
I wanted to fire you before because of my dad.

626
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,000
I don't like how he interferes with my life.

627
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,079
It has nothing to do with you.

628
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,719
But if you ever interfere with my rescue missions again,

629
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,920
then the conflict will be between you and me.

630
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
When I rescue people,

631
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,599
I help everyone who needs to be saved.

632
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,239
I don't get a single penny for it.

633
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,440
You're a bodyguard. You protect whoever pays you.

634
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,599
You don't care about those who don't give you money.

635
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,239
It's clear how we're different.

636
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,119
Your volunteer work is something you do occasionally.

637
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,440
I'm a professional.

638
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,679
I'm working every minute.

639
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,880
How can I live if I don't get paid?

640
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,289
You can't compare us like that.

641
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:53,769
All right. Keep talking.

642
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,880
Fine. Let me remind you again.

643
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,400
Since you're on a rescue team,

644
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
you should know very well...

645
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,360
that safety comes first.

646
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,000
If there has to be an order of priority,

647
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,400
your own safety comes first,

648
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,639
your team members' safety comes second,

649
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,719
and the victim's safety comes third.

650
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,360
Only then will you be able to save more people.

651
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
You...

652
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,809
You've memorized our rescue team fundamentals pretty well.

653
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,079
It's my duty.

654
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,079
I've done detailed research on you.

655
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,679
Let me tell you. What you just said is very true.

656
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,199
But I'm not listening.

657
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,480
You didn't hold me up today,

658
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,519
so I'll let it slide.

659
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,440
Next time, if you interfere with my rescue mission again,

660
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,599
I won't forgive you.

661
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,000
This is Huang Yue's wedding invitation.

662
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,559
It wasn't easy to get.

663
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,329
If you're up to no good,

664
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,880
you have to let me join you.

665
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,920
Please welcome the beautiful bride.

666
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
I've looked into it.

667
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,199
Huang Yue's husband's name is Bai Quan.

668
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,679
He's two years younger than her.

669
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,679
He's a local.

670
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,079
His height and weight are unknown.

671
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:01,400
His parents are both attending physicians...

672
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,480
at a third-tier hospital.

673
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,639
This guy studied oral medicine overseas.

674
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,559
Instead of working at a big hospital after returning to China,

675
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,719
he opened his own oral care and cosmetic surgery hospital.

676
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,769
It's quite popular.

677
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,519
According to a friend of Huang Yue's,

678
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,559
Huang Yue and Bai Quan met online.

679
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,840
They got married in less than three months.

680
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,159
It's exactly because these small things...

681
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,519
came together...

682
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,289
and became a promise to which they can entrust a lifetime.

683
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,639
Today, they will make this lifetime promise...

684
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:40,119
with their family and friends as witnesses.

685
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,119
They say marriage is about mutual understanding and trust.

686
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:48,809
It's entrusting oneself to the other and giving each other your hearts.

687
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,289
At this very moment, the groom, Mr. Bai Quan,

688
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,119
do you take this smart, pretty,

689
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:00,559
beautiful, and generous lady, Ms. Huang Yue, as your wife?

690
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,360
From now on,

691
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,239
for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse,

692
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,639
in sickness and in health,

693
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,199
will you always be by her side,

694
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,440
love her, care for her,

695
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,400
and give her a lifetime of happiness...

696
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,289
with all of your love...

697
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,559
for eternity?

698
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:20,519
Firmly tell her whether you do or not.

699
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
I do.

700
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,920
He looks like trash.

701
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,119
They look good together.

702
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,199
He's quite tall, but he lacks some class.

703
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,519
He's like a telephone pole. He can't compare to you.

704
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,519
He's even worse than me.

705
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,119
Tell me. What do you want to do to him?

706
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,519
Cut the nonsense. Are you ready?

707
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,239
We have a couple of options.

708
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,559
We can either spike his love shot...

709
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,239
or put a thumbtack in his shoe.

710
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,400
Otherwise, we can change the screen to something thrilling.

711
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,960
Or we can do all of those things.

712
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,519
Why are you so terrible?

713
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:48,289
You're barbaric.

714
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
- Despicable. - The groom's first time...

715
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,329
Am I someone who would secretly do bad things?

716
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:53,329
That's true.

717
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,840
You openly do bad things.

718
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,119
I'm sure their future together...

719
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,199
will be just like this kiss.

720
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,960
- Have you taken care of the emcee? - It'll be sweet and romantic...

721
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,809
- It's all set. - and worth reminiscing.

722
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,039
We're giving a gift today.

723
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,400
Are you nuts? How much does that cost?

724
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,360
I could buy several of your hotels with this.

725
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,809
You! That wench is already marrying someone else.

726
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:18,199
Forget it. You're not going to get anything out of this.

727
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,199
Why don't you give it to me?

728
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Now,

729
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,719
it's time for family and friends to give them their blessings.

730
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,809
- I'd rather take my chances. - We have a surprise for everyone.

731
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,239
What are you doing? Don't do anything reckless.

732
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,679
Now, let us welcome a mysterious guest...

733
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,480
from the bride's side, Mr. Hou Jue.

734
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:41,639
Watch.

735
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:42,809
You're really going for it.

736
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
What is he doing here?

737
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,639
Who is he?

738
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Why haven't I seen him before?

739
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:52,639
Maybe...

740
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,239
Congratulations.

741
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:08,329
Hello, everyone.

742
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,119
Hello. I'm Huang Yue's good friend.

743
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
My name is Hou Jue.

744
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,559
Today,

745
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:18,239
I am representing Huang Yue's 50 ex-boyfriends...

746
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,809
to wish her a happy marriage.

747
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,039
Who is he?

748
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:23,239
- I don't know. - Why is he talking nonsense?
