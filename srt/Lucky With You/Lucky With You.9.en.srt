Hou Jue!

I'm being bullied.

Come save me. I don't want to live anymore!

Didn't you just get there? How are you being bullied already?

She's the one bullying me.

She's forcing me to cut my hair.

Yeah.

How is cutting your hair bullying?

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,600
Oh, a reasonable person.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Hey handsome, this has nothing to do with me.

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't have the authority.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,800
It is you! You dare to do it, but not to admit it?

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Oh, please. Could your hair be transferred onto my head?

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,000
What good would it do me?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
You're the one that's too scared to talk to the director.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Not to mention, cutting your hair

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,700
is a work requirement. It might make you more popular.

57
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,800
Could you try being a little grateful?

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Doudou, listen up. Don't think I'm an easy target.

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,100
Do you know who he is?

60
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,200
This is the heir to Zhi Rong Construction.

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,500
And, my boyfriend!

62
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,200
And her? She's a bodyguard. She has combat skills.

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm telling you, crushing you would be easier than crushing a bug.

Doudou. Today in our live stream—

Hey, Fang Lu...

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,430
Lulu...

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Don't cry.

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
Don't cry, Lulu.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Lulu...

76
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,000
Why didn't you help just now?

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,300
I...I did help.

78
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,000
When that woman was shouting at me

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,600
and bullying me, you didn't do anything.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Right, she's no good. But you're all women, so what can I do?

81
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
I can only chide her a little.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
But you shouldn't have just let her bully me.

83
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,020
And...

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Isn't your bodyguard supposed to protect us?

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Why didn't she say anything?

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,100
They have their own

87
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,200
rules for the job. She can only protect me.

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,600
She only steps in if my life is in danger, you know.

89
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,400
She's not an attacker. She can't just beat everyone up.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
Right...

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
She's only in charge of protecting your life.

92
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,200
I have to be in charge of protecting my own life.

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Your life's not in danger. Don't cry anymore, okay?

94
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,800
She yelled at me like that. How can you say...

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
Didn't I come to scare her for you?

96
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to.

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
She's a woman. I can't say much.

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,600
She wants to cut my hair...

99
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Isn't your haircut a work requirement?

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Isn't it for the work you're so passionate about?

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,000
You artists..artists always sacrifice for their art, don't they?

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
Cutting your hair...

103
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
That's right.

104
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm just too green.

105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,800
It's fine, Brother Hou Jue.

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I...I can do it now.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I'll listen to the director. However much they want me to cut,

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,200
I'll do it. Even if they want me to be bald, it'll be okay.

109
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
No, wait.

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,600
I...I'll sacrifice for my art.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,800
Wait, Lulu. That's...

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm going now.

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Lulu.

114
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
What should I do now?

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,300
Why're you just standing there? Couldn't you help?

116
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,300
She was sobbing so heavily, like I wronged her...

117
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,100
Let's go. You drive.

118
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Fang Lu...

119
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,000
that poor girl.

120
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,400
Uh-huh.

121
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
I'm telling you,

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,200
Fang Lu's problem is that she's too kind.

123
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Too innocent.

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,000
These days, people get offended by those who are too innocent.

125
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,760
Uh-huh.

126
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,000
What do you mean, uh-huh? What kind of response is that?

127
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
What? I didn't say anything.

128
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,900
Look, if you have an opinion, just tell me.

129
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,200
"Uh-huh." I hate when people just say "uh-huh."

130
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
What should I say?

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,200
Should I say "poor girl?"

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,200
I don't pity her.

133
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,800
She's beautiful,

134
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,000
wears designer brands, and is popular, with lots of followers.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
And a guy cared so much about her,

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,300
he drove more than 200 kilometers to be at her beck and call.

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
How is she pitiable?

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
Because she suffers for her work?

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,200
I think everyone does. That's normal.

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
You can't judge her by your standards.

141
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,400
You're different. She's a young girl, you know.

142
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
Isn't she just too innocent?

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,400
She hasn't experienced much, so she needs a man to protect her.

144
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Uh-huh.

145
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,000
Back to the "uh-huh?"

146
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,800
It's such a shame.

147
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,200
What if we took some more photos as mementos?

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,600
No need. Just cut it.

149
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Alright, I'm really cutting it then.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
To become popular, you need to be a bit ruthless towards yourself.

151
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
No, wait!

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,000
What if you try plaiting my hair into braids?

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The director should be okay with that, right?

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Plaits?

155
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,300
I hope he agrees with this.

156
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
The director replied.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
What'd he say?

158
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
"That's very distinct."

159
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
He accepts. He accepts!

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
I don't need to cut my hair!

161
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,600
- Thank you, sister!<br>- Congratulations.

162
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,120
Thank goodness.

163
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,370
- They say that movie's pretty good.<br>- Oh, really?

164
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,700
- Its average rating is 8+.<br>- Wow.

165
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,020
- Let's watch it tomorrow.<br>- Okay.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,800
What happened, boss?

167
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
What's wrong with your shoulder? Did you get hit?

168
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,000
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,400
- Then...what if I massage it for you? Come here—<br>- No, no need.

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Ah, don-don't touch me!

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Done! Why don't you

172
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,600
- try moving it now?<br>- I told you...

173
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700
How is it?

174
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,800
Oh, it seems more relaxed now.

175
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Sounds about right. Didn't I tell you I have skills?

176
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
That's good. Why don't you massage a bit more?

177
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
But gently. Not so rough.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
I can massage gently, but it won't work if I'm too gentle.

179
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Come on then.

180
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,300
- How is it?<br>- You seem pretty professional.

181
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,800
Have you learned it before?

182
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, from my dad.

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Your dad's a doctor?

184
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
No, he's a veterinarian.

185
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,700
Why don't you get me some water?

186
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Your dad's a veterinarian?

187
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,140
Yep! I'm not lying.

188
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,600
He's a pretty famous veterinarian in our hometown.

189
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Whether it's a pig, cow, or sheep, if they're sick, they go to my dad.

190
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,200
My dad will ride his bike 2-3 hours just to treat them.

191
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
He's broken more than few bikes over the past year.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
- Your dad's pretty impressive.<br>- Of course.

193
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't underestimate small animals.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,600
Some of them can be pretty fierce.

195
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Pigs, cow, and sheep are okay.

196
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
One time, my dad had to treat a mule.

197
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,400
When he was trying to inject medicine, it kicked—

198
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Anyway, my dad had to spend a month recovering.

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
So what did you learn from your dad?

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Oh, I rambled too much.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Later, because my dad's skills were so well-honed,

202
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,800
he learned massage.

203
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Then he opened a big massage place in our hometown.

204
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
Why didn't you just skip to the massage part?

205
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Of your last 100 words, only 5 were relevant.

206
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
You hit me so hard, it hurts again. Am I a mule to you?

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,800
No, of course not. I'm sorry, boss.

208
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,200
Alright, it's okay.

209
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,440
Oh, boss, we got a package today. I think it's for you.

210
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
I already put it upstairs.

211
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,470
I did some adjustments after the last meeting.

212
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,520
I changed the original spatial shell structure

213
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,450
to the present sspatial grid structure.

214
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,130
How about it?

215
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,510
Pretty good.

216
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,100
But, if the quantity of the new materials isn't reduced,

217
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,900
perhaps there'll still be some problems with the construction timeframe and budget.

218
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,890
No, this is not a problem now.

219
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,630
Because, even though the new materials aren't reduced, but the overall frame has changed.

220
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,050
The auxiliary materials are greatly reduced. The installation process is also much simplified.

221
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,690
So I think the two sides can be balanced,

222
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,280
and the work hours and wages won't be increased.

223
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,030
Xiaohan, what do you think?

224
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,430
Personally, I think Jr. President Hou's ideas are good.

225
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,440
But, the previously issue is probably still overlooked.

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,380
That is, the Haicheng Number 8 project is les than one kilometer's distance from the coastline.

227
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,790
The sea water has very strong corrosive effect.

228
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,780
As of today, this new type of materials has not been used in coasstal areas.

229
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,930
It means that the future cost in repair and maintenance

230
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,320
may be quite a big expense.

231
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,070
It won't be. I already carefully researched the parameters of this new material.

232
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,830
The parameters prove that this material won't have any problems in coastal areas.

233
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,830
Enough. The new materials was already questioned last time.

234
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,130
Let's not discuss the same problem twice and waste everyone's time.

235
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,990
- Xiaohan, tell us about your proposal. <br> - Okay.

236
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,760
I haven't finished talking about mine.

237
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,530
You're done talking.

238
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,580
You speak.

239
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,860
<i>Please look at the large screen, everyone, for my proposal.</i>

240
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,260
- Where are you going? <br> - Home.

241
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,010
It's nothing to be a deserter every once in a while.

242
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,960
Who are you saying is the deserter?

243
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,370
Your dad criticized you in front of everyone.

244
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,830
- So you can't accept it? <br> - No.

245
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,050
It's fine to criticize me.

246
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,790
But he should have given me the basic respect. Get it?

247
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,420
He should trust me. So a son can't be given respect?

248
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,500
Perhaps your proposal really isn't good?

249
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,920
So what if it's not good?

250
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
If it's not good, I'll do it again, but at least let me finish talking.

251
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,360
Why couldn't he let me finish talking?

252
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,760
I'm not talking with you anymore. You don't understand it anyway. You don't have such parents.

253
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,120
How do you know I don't? My mom is like that.

254
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,770
Sure.

255
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,110
She looks outstanding and elegant now.

256
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,630
But, in my mind when I was young, she was a witch.

257
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,180
It's true.

258
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,250
Whenever I was home, no matter what I did, she would pick on me and discourage me.

259
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,880
Later, when I went to the training team, it was the same.

260
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,750
No matter how many competitions I won, she would say it's good luck, not because of my strength.

261
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,140
We're both kids who grew up under discouragement.

262
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,130
So I've always felt that I haven't worked hard enough.

263
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:24,850
I just kept training, kept going to competitions,

264
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,740
until I finally won and worn my first medal,

265
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,210
she finally said to me, you are great.

266
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,050
That's when I finally knew that

267
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,200
she kept pressuring me not because she didn't trust me

268
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,460
but because she wanted me to be better.

269
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,530
How about it? Let's exchange this kind of mother for your dad?

270
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,720
I'm not exchanging.

271
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,520
Let's go. Go back.

272
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,600
- You're not going home? <br> - I'm going to work on the proposal.

273
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,020
Didn't President Hou give the proposal to Bao Xiaohan?

274
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,710
He's working on it, so I can't anymore?

275
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,560
What if you are rejected?

276
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,530
Why do you have so much useless talk?

277
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,910
<i>(International Medical Care Center)</i>

278
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,020
<i>(Ao Gang City Medical Universitiy Affiliated Hospital)</i>

279
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,880
Hello. Are you Miss Qian?

280
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,420
I am.

281
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,830
I am Ma Baonan.

282
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,460
Hello, I am Qian Qian.

283
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,000
I recognized you when you were walking from over there.

284
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,190
Height, physique, appearance...

285
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,250
All are perfect.

286
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,950
Thanks.

287
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,820
Why did you ask me to meet here?

288
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,600
We can do an exam here.

289
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,710
No... what exam?

290
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,510
- For our child's DNA quality. <br> - What?

291
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,180
Everyone else's kids want to win even at the start.

292
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,230
My kid has to rush.

293
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,030
Besides, he has to win on DNA.

294
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm taking you inside to do an exam for high-quality birth.

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,100
If there is any hereditary defect,

296
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,890
then we don't need to waste our time, right?

297
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,730
If there isn't any problem, we'll let feelings be in charge.

298
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,190
You are impotent, but I haven't looked down on you!

299
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,250
Aren't we at the hospital already? We can get treatment!

300
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,880
What are you saying? Lower your voice.

301
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,240
Why lower the voice? We're at the hospital already, and already registered.

302
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,070
Go. Let's go see the doctor, go.

303
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,260
Are you insane?

304
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,620
You have to believe in science. It can be cured.

305
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,100
Don't leave!

306
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,290
Listen to me. Go see about your illness!

307
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,000
<i>Come in.</i>

308
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,040
President Hou. We should go to the meeting.

309
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,850
Meeting?

310
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,760
- It's time. <br> -- The finance department just told me.

311
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,240
We still haven't received two payments from two construction projects.

312
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,930
It's pay day the day after tomorrow.

313
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,340
There isn't enough money in the account right now.

314
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,760
Same old method. Get a loan from the bank to meet the urgent needs.

315
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,390
Okay.

316
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,730
President Hou, my contract with the company

317
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,620
is also coming due.

318
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,050
I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

319
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,300
- You still need to sign a contract with the company. <br> - Of course.

320
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,770
In my mind, you are an indispensable part of Zhi Rong Construction.

321
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,550
- Thank you for your recogniztion, President Hou. <br> - I feel embarrassed.

322
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,310
Do you have any thoughts about the contract?

323
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,830
None. I don't have any thoughts.

324
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,770
As long as you don't kick me out, I will work hard for you for the rest of my life.

325
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,260
- Look at what you're saying. <br> - We can sign a 70-year right to use.

326
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,950
Right to use isn't enough, lifetime property right.

327
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,810
Actually, a contract can't really tie up someone.

328
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,390
Even if I retreat to be the secondary position,

329
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,890
I will still let you continue to assist Hou Jue.

330
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,850
He must have someone like you by his side.

331
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,020
It's my honor. I'll abide by your arrangement.

332
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,060
<i>(Thanks!)</i>

333
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,420
<i>(Haicheng Number 8 Construction Proposal) <br>(Designer: Bao Xiaohan)</i>

334
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,410
OKay, the above is my design proposal.

335
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,260
THanks, everyone.

336
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,580
Everyone, say something.

337
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,400
What do you think of this proposal?

338
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,940
Xiaohan, I'll tell it straight.

339
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,900
I think this proposal isn't as good as mine.

340
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,710
Why?

341
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,390
Because this proposal's design is very conventional.

342
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,570
If building materials still follow the same style,

343
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,590
then this proposal won't have any bright spots.

344
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,960
About bright spots, I've considered that.

345
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,170
But, because of the project's particular geographic location,

346
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,090
it's not easy to innovate.

347
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,350
So I chose to play safe.

348
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,100
Yes, what you say makes sense.

349
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,790
I have no disagreement against you and I particularly appreciate your talent.

350
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,360
I think bright spots are a design's basic element

351
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,500
and the soul.

352
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,390
But, why does this kind of situation still occur?

353
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,370
It's not Xiaohan's problem. Ultimately, it's a fundamental issue with our rigid thinking.

354
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:46,440
I think, not only we should innovate the designs, we should also innovate our thinking.

355
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,490
If the company blindly restrict the young designers into one frame,

356
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,920
simply for being safe from making mistakes,

357
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,480
then I think it will be very difficult to create any

358
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,160
strong and new design products.

359
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,490
I have some new thoughts toward this proposal.

360
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,440
Want to hear?

361
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,470
Tell us about it.

362
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,010
First of all, I must apologize to President Hou.

363
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,590
My attitude was bad in the last meeting.

364
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,760
It's my problem. Please don't be angry.

365
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,200
Take a look at my proposal first.

366
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,120
For this proposal, I hope everyone will participate

367
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,730
in giving me suggestions and advice.

368
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,820
Everyone is sincere.

369
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,720
If anyone gives a valuable suggestion,

370
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,500
I personally will gift you a box of red wine. Okay?

371
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
That's my favorite.

372
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,260
Looks like we must pick bones from an egg. <br><i> (T/N: be overly critical)</i>

373
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,190
Give me the remote control.

374
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,830
<i>(Haicheng Number 8 Construction Project Proposal)<br>( Designer: Hou Jue)</i>

375
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,600
Did you see that?

376
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,000
The moment I presented my new proposal,

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,130
everybody changed their attitude toward me.

378
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,800
Okay.

379
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,100
What do you mean by Okay? You should applaud and celebrate to my genius ideas.

380
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I think Bao Xiaohan might be a bit angry upset.

381
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,200
Don't you think you should explain that to him?

382
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
Why?

383
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,200
Because you were rude when you gave suggestions.

384
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
In a meeting, good is good, bad is bad.

385
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,800
So if we use his proposal, should I be mad? Why would he be upset?

386
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,600
He keeps things in his mind,

387
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,500
also, he relatively new here and he hasn't connected with the team yet.

388
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,600
For this, it's doesn't matter whether he has been here long or short, does it?

389
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,000
As a man, if you lose, you need to recognize it.

390
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
I also haven't been here long.

391
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,500
I can adopt to the environment. As a senior, how can he failed to adopt?

392
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,000
Alright, it's just my suggestions.

393
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Feng Lu, why did you go to the class?

394
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,200
Isn't it at 2pm?

395
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,600
It was 8am. They notified us last night.

396
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,200
Did you oversleep?

397
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,600
It also took three alarms to wake me up.

398
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
But no one told me.

399
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,200
How is it possible?The director said this training is particularly important.

400
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,400
They even hired a model trainer to teach the class.

401
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
We even divided in groups.

402
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Perhaps you want to check with Dou Dou to see what's going on?

403
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It was her who notified us.

404
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,400
That's right.

405
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Okay. I got it. Thank you.

406
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Tomorrow afternoon 2pm class has moved to 8am. Same location.

407
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm notifying you. Don't be late.

408
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
<i>Don't be late.</i>

409
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
What are you thinking?

410
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Director Ma.

411
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,600
I must say you are working way too hard.

412
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,000
One constructive comment in exchange to one case of red wine.

413
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,200
You are not giving any chances to other designers.

414
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
I don't want it.

415
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,100
He is my father.

416
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,000
If I don't work hard, I am the one who don't have a chance.

417
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,800
How many people is jealous of you having a silver spoon father.

418
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Director Ma, if you want to be jealous,

419
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,600
let's go and call him Dad.

420
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I don't have that fortune.

421
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Your dad really loves you.

422
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
He never ambigious when he spends money on you.

423
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,000
When he thought that girl wasn't good for you, he rather paid her to leave you.

424
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
It can't go that far.

425
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
What did you just said?

426
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Nothing.

427
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,400
I was talking nonsense. That Huang Yu...

428
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Why this office tea tastes so biter?

429
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,200
- I need to...<br> -Wait, sit down. Director Ma.

430
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Huang Yu broke up with me is because she received money from my dad?

431
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,200
No. Abosultely not.

432
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
There is no such thing.

433
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
You've already said half, just tell me.

434
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
Did I startle you last time at the hallway?

435
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,350
Having lunch?

436
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,210
Dad, do you have bottomless money to spend?

437
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,400
What's the matter?

438
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,400
If you have so much money, let's donate to the charities.

439
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,800
To help poor kids in the disaster zones, build schools.

440
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Or buy me a new car.

441
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You paid ¥1,000,000 my ex girlfriend to break up with me?

442
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,260
Well, now you know the fact, what else can I say?

443
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,600
Dad, I want to thank you.

444
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,100
Thank me for what ?

445
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,000
Thank you for letting me see the truth behind a person.

446
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,300
I thank you for allowing meta know

447
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,800
there are people will exchange their relationship with money.

448
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Because of you, I can see

449
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,400
someone is willing to scarify our three year relationship for ¥1,000,000.

450
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,200
It's despicable.

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,400
I have told you before about this.

452
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
She's not reliable, is it?

453
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,800
Did you hear me? You didn't.

454
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
I don't have another way.

455
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,400
That's why I use my own way.

456
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,800
You got ride of three year relationship with ¥1,000,000.

457
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,500
Okay. Thank you, dad.

458
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,850
It's not too late to get it.

459
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Dad, you said one girlfriend is ¥1,000,000.

460
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,400
If it's like that all year round,

461
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm afraid you might bankrupt.

462
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,600
Bon Appetite.

463
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,300
Bon Appetite. Bye.

464
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
That kid.

465
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,200
Where are we going?

466
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Meet an old friend.

467
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,390
Where are you going, you have to tell me. That's my job.

468
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
I'm telling you, I'm meeting an old friend.

469
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,100
Don't you understand?

470
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,300
What's the matter? I'm going to talk to my ex-girlfriend and see what's going on.

471
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,800
We had been together for few years. When my dad gave her ¥1,000,000 and she broke up with me.

472
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,000
What's that?

473
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
She is already married. Is this necessary?

474
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,600
She is married, so what?

475
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,700
I'm still dumb enough to see her.

476
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,600
She just shoved me with a wedding invitation.

477
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,000
I suddenly woke up when I realized the groom isn't me.

478
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,400
I was flipped. That's the day you crushed my car.

479
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
So unfortunate.

480
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,400
I can tell you were angry that day.

481
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,600
How can I not be angry? Based on what?

482
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,800
If you got a boyfriend, fine. If you want to break up with me, fine.

483
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,200
You want to take the money. Fine. It's alright.

484
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,900
But you should at least come to me and tell me.

485
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,000
You can't not say anything and take care of things.

486
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,700
Then just dumped me like that. That's not right.

487
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
Give me the key.

488
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,400
I drive.

489
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,500
Hai Xing. The address of Bai Quan's dental office.

490
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,600
can you send it to me?

491
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
Hello?

492
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm ready. I'm heading out now. On my way.

493
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Okay. Will see you later.

494
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,330
Huang Yue.

495
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,920
Why are you here again?

496
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,290
Have you already spent all of the money?

497
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,560
Do you already know everything?

498
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,150
I've never had ¥1,000,000. I thought it was a lot.

499
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,210
Only after I spent it all, I knew that it's really nothing.

500
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,130
I know right. You should have asked for more then.

501
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,910
You should've asked for 10 million. Or 50 million.

502
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,240
Right? Then you would be able to buy more things.

503
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,430
You can't do anything with ten million.

504
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,350
And you sold our three-year-long relationship just like that.

505
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,480
Get it clear, okay?

506
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,970
It's not that I betrayed our relationship.

507
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,470
It's that I spared you.

508
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,740
Your marriage is a piece in the family business.

509
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,950
You should find a high status woman to marry.

510
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,220
Through your marriage, the business could rise to new levels.

511
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,640
And you personally could reach new levels.

512
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,610
Those are things that I will never be able to do.

513
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,750
Did you get brainwashed by my father?

514
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,570
It's because he is right.

515
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,090
I can't let you get in the way of your family's business plans just for me.

516
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,130
I can't bear that responsibility.

517
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,090
I'm afraid.

518
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,050
If you're afraid, you could have told me.

519
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,340
You could have asked for my opinion, right?

520
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,320
You can't just get married to a random guy.

521
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,300
That has nothing to do with him.

522
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,970
I won't use his money anyways. I only used this money that I got

523
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,580
to pay off my parent's debt from sending me to college in America

524
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,070
and bought this car. I also rented a store

525
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,050
to open a bakery.

526
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,490
Since I returned from America half a year ago, I haven't had a job at all.

527
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,960
I have always wanted to open a bakery.

528
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,230
It's not something I thought of recently.

529
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,360
I told you before, but

530
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,570
it didn't seem like you ever heard me.

531
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,660
Girls these days want to open a bakery today

532
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,030
and want to travel around the world tomorrow.

533
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:02,290
I thought that you were joking around. If you really wanted it, you could have told me more seriously and I would have opened one for you.

534
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,150
I had told you really seriously.

535
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,020
But didn't you say that

536
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,500
money only taints the purity of love?

537
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,570
Isn't it true though?

538
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,070
You're right.

539
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,720
But I am different than you.

540
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,490
You were born having everything. You spend money like running water.

541
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,860
You have no understanding of money.

542
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,910
But I do.

543
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,850
Thank you for not looking down on me.

544
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,460
You let me eat well and sleep well

545
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,650
the three years we were in America.

546
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,770
You also took me to many places to have fun.

547
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:45,080
However, I like it better when I have control of my own fate.

548
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,860
Did you ever think about waiting until I'd inherited the business?

549
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,730
You wouldn't just have ¥1,000,000, a car, and a bakery.

550
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,910
I'd rather take what I can get now,

551
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,010
than rely on an uncertain future.

552
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,510
The way things are now, the bakery can recoup its costs within three months,

553
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,650
then I will start to make profits.

554
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,420
And soon I can start sending money to my parents.

555
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,800
I feel very reassured this way.

556
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,110
During the three years we were together, you never once knew what I was thinking.

557
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,420
Or what I wanted.

558
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,890
Then what do you want?

559
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,940
I just want a stable life.

560
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,210
I want to get married.

561
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,120
I want to live a simple life.

562
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,580
But you are always like a child that never grows up.

563
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,470
You never gave me a sense of security.

564
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,800
You didn't make me feel assured at all.

565
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,820
Bai Quan gives me all that.

566
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,820
Hi honey. You haven't left yet?

567
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,160
Hubby.

568
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
It's you again.

569
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,490
I'm warning you. If you want to do something, come at me.

570
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,750
Don't make it hard on my wife.

571
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,160
Listen,

572
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,040
Bro,

573
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,190
I was wrong to crash your wedding.

574
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,370
I was a huge jerk.

575
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,490
I'll apologize. I'm sorry.

576
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,450
But I sincerely hope that

577
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,380
you two will be happy together.

578
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,000
I wish you both a blissful life.

579
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,360
I wish you two happiness.

580
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,290
I'm sorry.

581
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,900
Honey, let's go.

582
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,720
Should we use the same tactic on Fang Lu?

583
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,540
I'm afraid it won't work now.

584
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,130
I didn't want him to find out.

585
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,500
Who knew that we'd chase one off,

586
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,130
only for a worse one to show up?

587
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,120
It was unavoidable anyways.

588
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,790
His background is just too impressive.

589
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,010
He just came back from abroad and he's naive.

590
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,880
He doesn't get how to reject women.

591
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,820
So he gets targeted by all these women with ulterior motives.

592
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,780
That's what worries me.

593
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,420
If he wants to inherit the business, his mind and vision needs to be sharp.

594
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,340
Just being a nice guy,

595
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,390
he can't accomplish anything big.

596
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,420
So it was right to tell him about Huang Yue.

597
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,790
He's so smart.

598
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,900
When he speaks brashly, it's just because he wants your respect.

599
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,050
In his heart, he'll remember this lesson.

600
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,130
Actually, she wasn't wrong.

601
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,590
Nobody was right or wrong.

602
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,510
You just had different values.

603
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,070
You and your ex had different values. Was no one wrong there?

604
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,490
Guess I shouldn't compare the situations.

605
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:40,710
It's alright. I know you're upset.

606
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,050
Actually, Huang Yue didn't do anything wrong. And neither did I.

607
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,210
If we're assigning blame, that goes to my dad. With him around,

608
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,920
I'll never be able to live my own life.

609
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,180
Brother Hou Jue, I haven't seen you in forever.

610
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,680
Don't you care about me anymore?

611
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,250
Let's find a shopping mall. I need to buy something.

612
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,220
Sure.

613
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,110
Which...

614
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,580
Which one's good? Help me pick.

615
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,410
They're all very pretty.

616
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,020
Give me this one.

617
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,160
You have a great eye, sir. The necklace perfectly matches this lady's style.

618
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,420
No, it doesn't at all. If the necklace could hear you, it'd be pissed.

619
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,800
Does it suit you?

620
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,790
- Try it on for me.<br>- I will not.

621
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,380
Just try it on.

622
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,620
I will not!

623
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,000
-Try it—<br>- It doesn't suit me at all.<br>- Just let me see!<br>

624
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,390
It's really not right for you.

625
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,520
- That one then.<br>- Alright.

626
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,980
A few days ago, when we went to help Fang Lu,

627
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,220
we weren't any help at all. In the end, she was humiliated.

628
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,150
So I'm buying a present

629
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,470
to comfort and make her feel better.

630
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,860
You don't have to explain.

631
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,530
This isn't in the scope of my job.

632
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,630
Ex-explain? I'm just making small talk!

633
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,520
You never make small talk, you just follow me all day.

634
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,030
Can you hold onto it for me? I'm going over there.

635
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,670
Good morning, President Lan.

636
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,330
Morning.

637
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,750
This music clashes with the hotel ambiance. Change it.

638
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,490
Got it.

639
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,730
The flowers are too garish. Replace them with orchids.

640
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,680
Did you find the person I was looking for?

641
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,800
I reached out.

642
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,160
They said Wu Tianyi resigned five years ago.

643
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,430
He left this number behind, but I don't know if it works.

644
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,160
Hand it over.

645
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,250
Let all the managers know that we're meeting in my office in 15 minutes.

646
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,960
Will do.

647
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:12,720
