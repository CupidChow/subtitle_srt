(Episode 5)

4
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,439
Mr. Hou, the last time we met,

5
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,840
I handed out my business card to you at a forum.

6
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,599
I'm surprised you remember me.

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,359
Mr. Hou cherishes talented people.

8
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,359
He has never forgotten you.

9
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
Thank you, Mr. Hou.

10
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Have some tea.

11
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,079
Mr. Hou, I'm really sorry.

12
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,319
I'm going to tender my design...

13
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,280
and compete with your company.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,719
Don't worry.

15
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,319
Mr. Hou is a generous man.

16
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,560
He doesn't mind such things.

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,840
Xiao Han, your company...

18
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,039
is equivalent to a department at Zhirong Construction at most.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,439
That project means everything to you,

20
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,000
but it's just a trivial thing to our company.

21
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,199
Mr. Hou,

22
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,159
we have more than enough projects...

23
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,759
of this scale every year.

24
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,240
That's why we actually hope...

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,840
your company has the ability to bid against us.

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,039
As for your probability of winning,

27
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,280
I don't think I have to say more.

28
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,560
Yes, I understand.

29
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,800
- Mr. Ma. - Yes.

30
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,759
You can't say that.

31
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,039
New generations will eventually outshine the old.

32
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,199
We have to trust...

33
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,199
Xiao Han's abilities.

34
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,199
What if he is able...

35
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,280
to defeat my entire company all on his own?

36
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,719
Since you put it that way, I definitely believe it.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Xiao Han.

38
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,080
Mr. Hou values you so much.

39
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,240
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Hou.

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
You think too highly of me.

41
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,080
But to be honest, Mr. Hou,

42
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,000
I've admired you for a long time.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,199
Xiao Han,

44
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,080
since we've gotten this far...

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,639
and you're so sincere,

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,159
why don't you join my company's Design Department...

47
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,800
as a deputy director?

48
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,360
You'll be paid the same as the director...

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
and once you successfully finish the project,

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,520
I'll promote you to the director.

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,680
I'll double your pay.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
How about it?

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Really?

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,080
Xiao Han, Mr. Hou even invited you himself.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,879
Let's start your onboarding procedures today.

56
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,680
I am honored.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,800
But...

58
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,879
I still have to represent my current company...

59
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,520
in the bid for the Haicheng No. 8 Project.

60
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,319
I almost forgot about that.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,079
Then let's talk later when there's a chance...

62
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,879
and think of today as a simple chat over tea...

63
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,560
- Okay. - to get to know each other.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,680
- Mr. Ma. - Yes.

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm going to make a phone call.

66
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,439
Stay seated.

67
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,730
- Sit. - Mr. Hou...

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,920
Wait, Mr. Ma.

69
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,360
Is Mr. Hou angry?

70
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,170
You tell me.

71
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,800
You're so disappointing.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,839
You're such a fool. Do you know that?

73
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,120
Did you know people pull strings just to meet with Mr. Hou?

74
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,560
Mr. Hou took time...

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,360
out of his busy schedule to see you today.

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,639
He promised you a high rank with a high salary,

77
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,170
yet you're still hesitating.

78
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,199
I don't know what you're thinking.

79
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,759
I'm telling you.

80
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,519
Good chances only come once. It's now or never.

81
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,759
Yes.

82
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,680
Mr. Ma, I understand everything you're saying.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,120
I am also extremely grateful to Mr. Hou for appreciating me.

84
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
But...

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
I've already finished my design.

86
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,079
I can't just give up and quit like this.

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,800
Then consider bringing your design with you.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,160
I'll...

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
have a good talk with Mr. Hou...

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,199
and suggest having you represent Zhirong Construction at the bid.

91
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,360
That way,

92
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,319
your hard work won't go to waste, right?

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
I see.

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Xiao Han.

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,639
Actually,

96
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,120
the world is full of talented people,

97
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,199
but what they lack are opportunities.

98
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,439
We're giving you a bigger platform...

99
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,759
to showcase your talent right now.

100
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,759
If you don't have any ambition,

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,720
we won't force you.

102
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,560
It's okay. There will be a chance in the future.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
Wait.

104
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,519
I'll go.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go right now.

106
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,319
Mom.

107
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,519
Why are you here?

108
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,839
I came to see you.

109
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,000
What a great company.

110
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,279
It's classy.

111
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,560
I like it.

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
It's not convenient here. Let's talk over there.

113
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
- Come on. - Okay.

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
- Mom, have some water. - Okay.

115
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,920
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,120
What if I was out?

117
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,279
So what if you were?

118
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,519
It's on my way anyway.

119
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,519
How are you getting along with your client?

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,759
Not bad. It's good.

121
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,120
How old is he?

122
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,759
Why do you ask?

123
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,120
How is his personality?

124
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,600
Mom.

125
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,079
Shi Yi.

126
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,680
This is...

127
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,199
This is my mom.

128
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,600
This is my client, Hou Jue.

129
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
Hello, Mrs. Wu.

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,319
- Hello. - You're so young, Mrs. Wu.

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,480
Thank you for your compliment.

132
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,120
I need to talk to my mom.

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
Call me anytime if you need anything.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll let you two talk. Have a seat, Mrs. Wu.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay. Carry on with your work.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Sit.

137
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Sit down.

138
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,519
That kid is pretty nice.

139
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,279
Did you two already know each other before...

140
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,000
or did you meet him when you became his bodyguard?

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,879
I guess we kind of knew each other before.

142
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,799
That's a relief.

143
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,480
Don't worry. I'm fine.

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,330
I'm doing fine now. My job is great too.

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
You're just too thin.

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,090
Really?

147
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,679
Ms. Shi Yi.

148
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,450
These are Mr. Hou's suggestions...

149
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,559
for revising Mr. Hou Junior's proposal.

150
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,679
I was on my way to give it to him.

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,120
Please bring this to him.

152
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,600
- Okay. - Thank you.

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360
This document is from Mr. Hou.

154
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,559
Where's your mom?

155
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,679
She left.

156
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,879
Why did she leave so fast?

157
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,480
I wanted to treat her to some chocolate.

158
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,879
You're so nice to my mom.

159
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,480
You treat her so much better than you treat me.

160
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,240
If you were as pretty as your mom,

161
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
I would treat you to some chocolate too.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,960
Everyone says I look a lot like my mom.

163
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Are you kidding? You don't look alike at all.

164
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,330
Your dad...

165
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,039
must have lowered your average score in the looks aspect.

166
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,120
It must have taken your dad a lot of effort...

167
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,840
to pursue your mom back then, right?

168
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,679
They're divorced.

169
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,120
They've been divorced for 17 years.

170
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,159
Is that so?

171
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,840
But my dad still misses my mom and wants to get back together.

172
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,559
My mom doesn't want to.

173
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,679
They're both single now.

174
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,120
Your dad is quite loyal.

175
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,480
He still misses her after so many years.

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,090
Your mom...

177
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,879
I can't exactly pinpoint it,

178
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,600
but she somehow looks like my mom.

179
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,330
Then that proves...

180
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:16,639
you don't look like your mom either.

181
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,090
Thank you.

182
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,279
She took my chocolate again.

183
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,840
Hurry up. Xiao Zhang!

184
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,450
You guys. Xiao Li.

185
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,799
Hurry up, all of you. Come over here.

186
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,159
Is a newbie joining us?

187
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,759
- It must be that one. - Is it a guy or girl?

188
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,450
Why are you standing there? Come up here.

189
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,210
Let me introduce you.

190
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,919
He's the new deputy director of the Design Department,

191
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,450
Bao Xiao Han.

192
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,159
He is also a young designer whom Mr. Hou particularly admires.

193
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,240
Come on, give him a warm welcome.

194
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,120
- Welcome. - Welcome.

195
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Welcome.

196
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,320
Thank you, everyone.

197
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,120
I look forward to working with all of you.

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
You've all heard this now.

199
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,519
Get back to work.

200
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,519
- He seems pretty remarkable. - Yes.

201
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,320
You saw them. They're our design team.

202
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Xiao Han, let's go this way.

203
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
This is my office.

204
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,480
This is where you'll work.

205
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,039
It's great.

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,600
I hope you'll do great things here.

207
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,799
The Logistics Department will bring your office supplies later.

208
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,840
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Ma.

209
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,519
Xiao Han.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,679
I'll see you at the bid tomorrow.

211
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,840
- You can do this. - I can do this.

212
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,320
Let me know if you need anything.

213
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,480
Okay, Mr. Ma.

214
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,919
Have some water.

215
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,639
What's the name of the new designer? Bao what?

216
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,960
Bao Xiao Han.

217
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,919
It's amazing.

218
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,519
People really do get wiser as they get older.

219
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
My dad found this designer in just two days.

220
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,679
It's rare to hear a compliment from you.

221
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
I announce...

222
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,360
that Zhirong Construction...

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,080
has won the bid for the Haicheng No. 8 Project!

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,159
Zhirong Construction sure has extraordinary talent.

225
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,519
You flatter me, Mr. Zhang.

226
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,759
This bid is just the beginning...

227
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,480
for Zhirong Construction.

228
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,320
Our biggest wish is to be able...

229
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,919
to take part in Haicheng's business.

230
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,200
Mr. Zhang, I'm sure we will cooperate very well.

231
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,279
I'm sure of that too.

232
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,279
Thank you.

233
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,639
You don't have to see me out any further, Mr. Zhang.

234
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,080
Okay. Take care, Mr. Hou.

235
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,080
We must credit today's success...

236
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,960
to our hero, Xiao Han.

237
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,960
You're flattering me.

238
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,559
You're too kind, Mr. Hou.

239
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,039
I have to thank you for your support.

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
I'm sorry. Thank you.

241
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,600
By the way, Mr. Ma,

242
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,519
prepare a celebration party right away.

243
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,480
I've already prepared one in advance.

244
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
Didn't you already expect this?

245
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,840
Are you using a facial mask?

246
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,720
I drink water, eat, and go to the toilet too.

247
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I thought you were a manly woman who doesn't use beauty products...

248
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,639
even if your face is all dry and cracked.

249
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,720
What is it?

250
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,840
Don't dress too badly for tomorrow's event.

251
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,279
Wear something nice.

252
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,720
Everyone will be wearing their formal wear.

253
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,919
You also can't look too bad, right?

254
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,039
What?

255
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,039
What are you doing?

256
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,279
Are you hiding someone inside?

257
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
That's right.

258
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,120
Tell your boyfriend to help you pick an outfit.

259
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,279
Don't dress like a bodyguard tomorrow, okay?

260
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,399
Don't embarrass me.

261
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,919
Then I might disappoint you.

262
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,759
We're usually invisible at events like this.

263
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,159
Try your best, okay?

264
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,679
Try to have a good taste.

265
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,919
Make yourself look good.

266
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,919
If you really can't do it,

267
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,919
I'll dress ugly to match your style.

268
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,080
Thank you.

269
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
How annoying.

270
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,919
- Good morning. - Good morning.

271
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,879
Xiao Fei.

272
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,320
Is it a company holiday today?

273
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,519
Why wasn't I informed?

274
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,519
No.

275
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,840
If not, where is everyone?

276
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,919
They're attending the contract-signing party.

277
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,000
The party?

278
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,159
That's not right. The party is at 11am.

279
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,480
It's only 9:30am now.

280
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,960
Didn't you get the call?

281
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,360
The Design Department doesn't have to come to work...

282
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
this morning.

283
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,960
Everyone can just go directly to the party.

284
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Nobody informed me.

285
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Who was responsible for informing us?

286
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
It was me.

287
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,399
I sent a mass email according to the party guest list.

288
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Look at this.

289
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,039
(Haicheng No. 8 Project Celebration Party Employee List)

290
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,519
(Design Department: Chen Meng Peng, Hou Jue, Zhou He Hong, Ding Da Li)

291
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,919
This isn't right. Why isn't my name on it?

292
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,240
I don't know about that.

293
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,039
Okay, thank you.

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Please come in.

295
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,920
Were you looking for me?

296
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,650
Mr. Hou.

297
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,650
Where is Bao Xiao Han?

298
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,799
- Why didn't you invite him? - Why should he come?

299
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,799
How can we celebrate without him?

300
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,119
Without my company,

301
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,410
no matter how good his design is, it would just be a piece of paper.

302
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,960
He is the main contributor to the success of this bid.

303
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,200
That's what you said.

304
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,319
Yes, I did say that.

305
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,599
I already gave him a bit of acknowledgment yesterday.

306
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,200
Isn't that right?

307
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,599
He has gained enough.

308
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,799
Could his contributions be greater than the company's?

309
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,519
Don't forget.

310
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,599
He was just an unknown designer...

311
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,079
at a small company before.

312
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,720
I discovered him.

313
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,839
I gave him a bigger platform.

314
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,650
Just based on that,

315
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,319
he should be grateful to me for the rest of my life.

316
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,279
It was our bid,

317
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,119
but we used his drawings...

318
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,039
and his design.

319
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,559
We won the bid,

320
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,039
so now we're having a celebration party.

321
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,170
The whole Design Department is here,

322
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,650
but only he wasn't invited.

323
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,000
What would he think of this?

324
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,359
Hou Jue, don't you understand?

325
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,410
Bao Xiao Han...

326
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,440
is like Lu Bu in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms".

327
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,240
You can use someone like him,

328
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,960
but you also have to be mindful of him.

329
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,079
He suddenly joined my company at the last minute.

330
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,359
That means he can jump ship again in the future.

331
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,240
People like him will do anything for his own profit.

332
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,890
Nothing will satisfy him.

333
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,799
Besides,

334
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,519
do you really not know why did I do this?

335
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,599
I don't know.

336
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,799
I want you...

337
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
to lead this project.

338
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,559
Can't you tell?

339
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,119
What's wrong?

340
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,319
Do you not want to take over the family business?

341
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,170
I don't mind leading the project.

342
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,359
I also want to take over the family business.

343
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,000
But I don't want to climb up the ladder by stepping on others.

344
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,319
I don't feel good about this.

345
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,759
Then you have to learn how to accept this.

346
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,599
How can anyone be successful without stepping on others?

347
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,960
You can only climb higher if more people stay at the bottom.

348
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,599
It's the law of success.

349
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,759
Silly boy.

350
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
You still have a lot to learn.

351
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,039
You're the only one who cherishes your own compassion.

352
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,519
But to them,

353
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,890
it's worthless.

354
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,170
What's the matter? Did something happen?

355
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,890
If you have to step on others to climb up the ladder,

356
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,519
would you do it?

357
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,890
What do you mean?

358
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,240
My dad told me to step on...

359
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,890
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

360
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,720
- Have some champagne. - Thank you.

361
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Thank you.

362
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,960
- Cheers. - Nice to meet you.

363
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,890
I think this project will be great. Don't you think so?

364
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:25,410
Talk to you later.

365
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,839
This is a good project.

366
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,839
You're welcome.

367
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
It's all right.

368
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,079
What are you looking at? What is it?

369
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,720
It makes me uncomfortable seeing you dressed like this.

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,890
Look at the young girls.

371
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,960
All of them are gorgeously dressed.

372
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,170
Look at those dresses...

373
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,839
and the waves in their hair.

374
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,000
Look at you.

375
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,170
You don't dare to wear anything nice.

376
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,839
You stand there like you're invisible every day.

377
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,559
It's for work.

378
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,960
Isn't being invisible a good thing?

379
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,480
No one will notice if I eat more later.

380
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,680
Do you eat?

381
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,599
I always thought you lived on photosynthesis.

382
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,319
I had no idea you could eat so much.

383
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,759
You're overthinking it.

384
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,000
Hou Jue.

385
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,960
Your dad is asking for you.

386
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,079
Why? I'm not going.

387
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,079
I'm telling you.

388
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,079
There are so many people there.

389
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,039
Don't make him look bad. I'm begging you.

390
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,119
I'm begging you.

391
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's go. Come on.

392
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,759
Shi Yi, don't follow too closely. You'll stand out.

393
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,000
Just ensure it's safe.

394
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,359
Come on.

395
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
The three of us...

396
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,279
- Let's have a nice drink. - Okay.

397
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,410
Come, Hou Jue. Come.

398
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,720
Let me introduce you.

399
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,680
This is Mr. Wei, the CEO of Yuanfang Group.

400
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,000
This is my son, Hou Jue.

401
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,279
Hello, Mr. Wei.

402
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,279
- Hou Jue is really handsome. - Thank you, Mr. Wei.

403
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,839
You even graduated from a prestigious university in the US.

404
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,880
That's great.

405
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,640
Mr. Wei, your son is the one worth admiring.

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He's already able to take over half of your business.

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,839
I'm so jealous.

408
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,920
I don't have that luck.

409
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,799
Both of your sons are handsome and outstanding.

410
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,240
Mr. Wei, let me take this call. I'll leave you guys to chat.

411
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,720
You know how to react quickly.

412
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Thank you.

413
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,519
Mr. Ma.

414
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,319
- Are you planning to go public? - Yes.

415
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,720
Yes.

416
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,640
Here, cheers. I look forward to working with you.

417
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Let's keep in touch.

418
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,680
- Cheers. - Cheers.

419
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Mr. Wang, please wait.

420
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,640
Let's talk later.

421
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,839
Okay, go ahead.

422
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,640
Who are you messaging?

423
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,480
You're so busy. Why did you tell me to come out?

424
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,440
This is good for your eyes. It's excellent.

425
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,640
I bought it but didn't have time to give it to you.

426
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm making some time now.

427
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,359
You have to be in front of the computer...

428
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,079
doing accounting for such a long time every day.

429
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,160
Don't forget to eat this, okay?

430
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,079
Thank you.

431
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,680
How great would it be if we could openly be together...

432
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,079
instead of sneaking around like this?

433
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,559
Then one of us would have to quit.

434
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
Hou Zhi Rong doesn't allow office romances.

435
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
You know that.

436
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,680
I can leave.

437
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,640
How can you leave?

438
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,759
I won't allow it.

439
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,160
Didn't we agree on this?

440
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
You have to help me get even with him.

441
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Let me be honest with you.

442
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,680
Sometimes, I really want to give the company to Ma Yong.

443
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,079
But he's an outsider.

444
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,799
Outsiders may have other intentions.

445
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,519
We have to be careful of them.

446
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,759
Do you understand?

447
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
I don't trust anyone in this company right now,

448
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,759
except for you.

449
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,799
I already did what you asked...

450
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,440
and hacked into Hou Jue's computer.

451
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,720
It didn't seem to do much.

452
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,480
Be patient.

453
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,519
A father will definitely feel the pain of his son's suffering.

454
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,519
This is just the beginning.

455
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,599
What?

456
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,000
Hello. Please show me your invitation.

457
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,559
- This place is huge. - Be quiet.

458
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,720
- Hello. - Hello.

459
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,000
- Please show me your invitation. - I have two invitations.

460
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,119
Okay, please come in.

461
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
Keep it down. Keep smiling.

462
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,160
What are you doing?

463
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,119
Look around. No one is eating.

464
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,039
This is just for show.

465
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,119
You're embarrassing.

466
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,000
Do you see the guy on the sofa?

467
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,240
What's wrong?

468
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
In this environment,

469
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
he's still able to sleep so comfortably...

470
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,559
and no one is bothering him.

471
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,240
He's even sleeping so arrogantly.

472
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,839
He's clearly not an ordinary person.

473
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,200
That makes sense.

474
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,680
Shi Yi.

475
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,119
My phone battery is dead. Get me a charger.

476
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,799
Hold on.

477
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,799
Wait.

478
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,640
- I'll ask around for you. - Okay.

479
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,960
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

480
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,839
Who is that man on the sofa?

481
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,480
Why do you ask?

482
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,519
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

483
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,960
I'm sorry, I don't know him.

484
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,799
Excuse me.

485
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,839
Who is that man on the sofa?

486
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,559
I think he's Mr. Hou Junior.

487
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,759
- Mr. Hou Junior? - Yes.

488
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Okay, thank you.

489
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,480
- You can get back to work. - No problem.

490
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,599
Mr. Hou Junior.

491
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
Excuse me. Coming through.

492
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,519
You're eating again.

493
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
We've hit the jackpot.

494
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,319
Who is it?

495
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,319
He's Mr. Hou Junior.

496
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,559
Who's Mr. Hou Junior?

497
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,200
Don't you know whose banquet you're attending?

498
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,920
Is he Mr. Hou Junior from Zhirong Construction?

499
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,279
- I got it. - Go.

500
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,920
Don't even get me started.

501
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,039
I...

502
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,519
I really hate these events.

503
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,240
We just met,

504
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,559
but they talk so affectionately...

505
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,799
like they watched me grow up or something.

506
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,039
How fake.

507
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,480
It hurts so badly.

508
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,039
Mary brought me here.

509
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,039
She said if I want to be an actress,

510
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,240
I have to build more connections or whatever.

511
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,599
But I'm not really interested.

512
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,359
It's so boring.

513
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,759
Hello.

514
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Hello.

515
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,480
It's quite boring here, isn't it?

516
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,599
Did you hear me?

517
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,279
I'm pretty bored too.

518
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,599
I don't like these events.

519
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,000
Is that so?

520
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes.

521
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,680
Then we're the same type of person.

522
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,279
I heard you say you're a celebrity.

523
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,079
No way.

524
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,839
I'm only a rookie actress who just debuted.

525
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,400
Don't even ask me what I've filmed.

526
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
I haven't done anything yet.

527
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,680
It's okay. Just work hard.

528
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,519
You have the looks of a celebrity.

529
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,079
You'll definitely succeed one day.

530
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,160
Really?

531
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,640
You're so kind.

532
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,599
And you are...

533
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,920
I just debuted too.

534
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,319
I'm a designer.

535
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,640
Don't ask me what I've designed.

536
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
I haven't done anything yet.

537
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,400
You're so funny. You're copying me.

538
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,359
It's rare to meet someone whom I can rant to...

539
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,160
at an event like this.

540
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,279
Why don't we add each other on WeChat?

541
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
Okay.

542
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,880
- I'll scan your QR code then. - Okay.

543
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,799
"Fearless Lu Lu."

544
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,359
Yes, that's my Weibo ID too.

545
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,599
You can search for it.

546
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,119
Let me see.

547
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,480
You said you haven't filmed anything yet,

548
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,960
but why do you have so many fans?

549
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,039
I bought them.

550
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,480
You're so honest.

551
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,960
It's true.

552
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,599
A friend of mine did it for me.

553
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,240
And those photos on there are all lies. Don't believe them.

554
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,480
Whenever I have a chance to visit luxury restaurants,

555
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,720
I'll take photos everywhere...

556
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,960
and post them on different days.

557
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,240
That way, people will think...

558
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,079
that I eat all kinds of good food at different restaurants every day.

559
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,160
- Is that so? - And...

560
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,680
And my clothes. This...

561
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,759
It's inconvenient to show you.

562
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,680
The tag is still on it.

563
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I'll be returning this after the party.

564
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,920
Then why are you going through all this trouble?

565
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,200
I want to be a good actress.

566
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,680
I don't have any platforms to showcase myself...

567
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,039
and I don't have a good educational background.

568
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,160
The only thing I can do is to try and make myself look good...

569
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,559
and grasp every opportunity I get.

570
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,759
You're quite determined.

571
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,440
It's not easy.

572
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,880
- Mr. Hou Junior. - Mr. Wei.

573
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,079
- I'm leaving now. - All right.

574
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,480
Come to my office sometime.

575
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,640
- I won't see you out then. - There's no need.

576
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,559
So you're Mr. Hou Junior.

577
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,279
I guess we're on different tiers then.

578
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't want people to misunderstand...

579
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,680
and think that I'm sucking up to the rich.

580
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,519
- That's it. I'm leaving. - What are you talking about?

581
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,519
What tiers?

582
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,720
Let me tell you.

583
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,720
My grandpa used to be a farmer.

584
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,359
Our family shared one bed.

585
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,000
The winter was insufferable.

586
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,960
Your family can't be poorer than mine.

587
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you trying to compete on who's poorer?

588
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,480
Why don't we meet up one day...

589
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,839
and see who's poorer?

590
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,519
Sure.

591
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,599
Does that sound good?

592
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,599
Okay.

593
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,119
- All right. I'm leaving. - Bye.

594
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,559
I'm starving.

595
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,920
I didn't dare to eat anything just now.

596
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
I didn't want my dress to pop open.

597
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,759
Stop eating. You've already eaten so much.

598
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,039
By the way,

599
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,119
who was that woman next to him just now?

600
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,839
Where?

601
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,119
I don't know. He didn't introduce her.

602
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,839
She's probably his assistant or secretary.

603
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,480
We're doomed.

604
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,759
She was the first person that I asked about Hou Jue.

605
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,680
That's right.

606
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,599
Then my act was for nothing.

607
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,720
No way.

608
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,640
We have to think of a way around it.

609
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,240
Don't worry.

610
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,119
If she stands in the way to take him from you,

611
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,359
I'll get rid of her.

612
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,880
I'll do just that.

613
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,480
I'll leave it to you.

614
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,960
He liked a lot of my posts.

615
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,079
He's already showing interest in you now.

616
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,319
You definitely have a chance.

617
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm following him back then.

618
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,759
You know what?

619
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,480
He's different from all of the other men I've met.

620
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,440
Nobody else ever looked at my Weibo.

621
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,039
Look at this.

622
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,799
His Weibo introduction says,

623
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,359
"Team member of the Angel Rescue Team."

624
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,240
He's so caring.

625
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,680
So he's a warmhearted guy!

626
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Mr. Hou.

627
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,839
- Good morning. - Good morning.

628
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,319
Xiao Han.

629
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,200
Yesterday's party...

630
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,599
was no fun at all.

631
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,160
It was just a social networking event.

632
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,319
It was for the formalities.

633
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,680
How boring.

634
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,599
That's why I invited the employees who can drink...

635
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,359
so they can drink a bit on my behalf.

636
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,440
I know you came from the tech industry...

637
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,839
and I heard them say...

638
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,519
you can't really drink, right?

639
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,799
- Yes. - That's why...

640
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,119
it's a good thing I didn't ask you to go.

641
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,440
I was afraid you'd be too bored there.

642
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,559
Moreover,

643
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,000
the bidding proposal is done now...

644
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,319
and you worked so hard,

645
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,359
so I wanted you to rest more.

646
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,799
Don't take it to heart.

647
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,559
Mr. Hou, I don't mind.

648
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,759
You're overthinking it.

649
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,039
You're right.

650
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,599
It's not like I can drink.

651
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,240
It would've been awkward for me.

652
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,559
You're so thoughtful.

653
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,680
That's good.

654
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,000
We're here. Let's go.

655
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,119
After you.

656
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Work hard.

657
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,319
The day the story happened

658
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,329
I came to you

659
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,329
Walking into your world, one step at a time

660
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:21,960
You said you're going to go to another planet

661
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,480
I'm willing to go with you

662
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,329
And build up our land of love again

663
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,719
From a barren land

664
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,360
To a place of romance

665
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,119
I want to be the lucky charm you hold close to you

666
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,239
Your smile becomes the sun

667
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,000
Your breath becomes the moon

668
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:59,880
Your eyes are like the stars and your hair is like the wind

669
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,119
No matter how rough the weather is outside

670
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,880
I'll always be your home

671
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,719
I'll be your sun

672
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,360
You're my moon

673
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,639
- Our boss is a great singer! - That was great!

674
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,000
- That was so good. - What's the song you sang?

675
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You were so good.

676
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,719
Recently, something tugged at my heartstrings.

677
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,239
I was inspired,

678
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:30,000
so I wrote a song.

679
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,400
You're amazing.

680
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,519
You're awesome.

681
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,440
Boss,

682
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,159
what was your inspiration for this song?

683
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:39,559
Love.

684
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,159
Love.

685
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,920
A boy wants to protect a girl forever.

686
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,360
It's like the sun shining down on the moon.

687
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,480
Isn't it romantic?

688
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,920
- Yes. - It is romantic.

689
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,639
I don't know whether it's romantic or not,

690
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,000
but I know...

691
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,880
if I like someone,

692
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,199
I'll give him a lot of delicious food.

693
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,289
By the way, boss, you haven't eaten, have you?

694
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,639
- Let's eat together. - I'm not eating here today.

695
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,559
Do I look handsome today?

696
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,199
- Yes. - Yes.

697
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,440
I'm heading off.

698
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,920
Wait. Boss, where are you going?

699
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,039
Are you eating?

700
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,920
Hi, Mr. Hou.

701
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,440
Have a seat.

702
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,679
Mr. Bao.

703
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,960
Don't say that, Mr. Hou Junior.

704
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,480
Don't call me Mr. Bao.

705
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,119
That's not appropriate.

706
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,519
Just call me Xiao Han.

707
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:45,289
No, you always call me Mr. Hou.

708
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,719
It's not right for me to call you Xiao Han.

709
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,329
- It's fine. - Why don't you call me Hou Jue?

710
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,599
Then I'll call you Xiao Han. How about that?

711
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,119
Mr. Hou Junior, you're so approachable.

712
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:57,559
Approachable?

713
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:00,480
- I've never heard that before. - Is that so?

714
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,840
I don't really like that word.

715
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,480
Then...

716
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,679
It's okay. You eat first.

717
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,840
You eat first.

718
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,960
I'll eat over there.

719
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
Eat more.

720
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,719
Take care, Mr. Hou Junior.

721
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,329
This guy...

722
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,119
Am I that scary?

723
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,920
I said three sentences,

724
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,039
but he was scared to death.

725
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,719
He's not scared of you.

726
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,840
You're right.

727
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,719
I was thinking of dropping out of the Haicheng No. 8 Project...

728
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,679
and letting him lead it.

729
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,119
But seeing the state he's in,

730
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,639
I really don't think he's suitable.

731
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,809
He doesn't look like a leader.

732
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,809
My dad sure was right about him.

733
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:20,159
Hello. Who are you looking for?

734
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:22,329
I'm here to see Qian Xiao Yan.

735
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,440
Do you have an appointment with Ms. Qian?

736
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,769
No.

737
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,519
I'm her family member.

738
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,079
Okay, hold on.

739
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,119
The management is strict here.

740
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,480
What are you doing?

741
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,039
Why are you so weak? Get moving!

742
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,400
Be quick! Combo!

743
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,559
Keep going.

744
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,159
Adjust the way you fall and make sure to protect yourself.

745
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,679
Good. Not bad.

746
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,769
Do a whip kick.

747
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,719
Aim your punch at his abs. Throw a one-legged kick!

748
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,159
Protect. Do a combo.

749
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,840
Lift your arms high.

750
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,639
Lift your arms.

751
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,769
Is that all you've got?

752
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Hello.

753
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Who is it?

754
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,599
"Qian Xiao Yan."

755
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,599
(The Eighth Amateur Sanda Class, Instructor: Qian Xiao Yan)

756
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,920
"Instructor."

757
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,079
Hello.

758
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,039
Were you looking for me?

759
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,960
You look so cool in a military uniform.

760
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,440
Do you still remember me?

761
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,000
Yes.

762
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:07,599
Hello, Ms. Qian.

763
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,440
I'm so glad you remember me.

764
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,519
I thought you didn't remember.

765
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,000
Well, I came here today...

766
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,840
to invite you to my restaurant.

767
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,199
I thought it would be too rude to invite you through WeChat.

768
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,519
It's more earnest if I do it in person.

769
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Okay.

770
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,199
Are you agreeing to it just like that?

771
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,840
What else am I supposed to do?

772
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,199
No.

773
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,000
I just didn't expect you to agree so quickly.

774
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,119
Because...

775
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,000
to be honest,

776
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,679
it's my first time asking a girl out to have dinner,

777
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:48,199
so it's a little bit nerve-racking.

778
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,519
I thought you'd say no.

779
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,400
But that's good.

780
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,329
I...

781
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,480
I was initially thinking...

782
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,239
if you rejected me,

783
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,769
I would be like those people on TV...

784
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:01,719
and come here to wait for you every day...

785
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,199
until you say yes.

786
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,079
Shouldn't you ask a girl...

787
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,559
what she wants to eat when you first ask her out?

788
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,559
Yes.

789
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,840
Look, I have no experience.

790
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm inexperienced.

791
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,480
What do you want to eat?

792
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,880
Huawu Restaurant at 6pm.

793
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,440
I still have a class. See you at the restaurant.

794
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:23,400
Okay.

795
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,239
Is there anything else?

796
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:30,769
No.

797
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,199
- See you at 6pm. - Bye.

798
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,199
Honey.

799
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,809
As you said,

800
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,400
that guy called Hai Xing came to find me at work.

801
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,000
He said he wants to treat me to a meal.

802
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,679
I'm planning to shoot him down.
