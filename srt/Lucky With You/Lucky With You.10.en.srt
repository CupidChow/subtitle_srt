(Episode 10)

4
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
All they do is rush me.

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,480
The money isn't due yet.

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,799
They just keep rushing me.

7
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Hello.

8
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Hello.

9
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,000
Is this Mr. Wu Tian Yi's number?

10
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,810
No.

11
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,719
What's wrong with you?

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,240
I told you this isn't Wu Tian Yi's number?

13
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Hello, Mr. Wu.

14
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,879
It's me, Lan Qi.

15
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,879
Who is it?

16
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,319
Lan Qi?

17
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,840
Yes, do you remember me?

18
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,280
It's you.

19
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,240
I thought it was a prank call.

20
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,599
Scammers are so rampant nowadays.

21
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,759
Look at that. I almost missed out on your call.

22
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
That's right.

23
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,159
I was planning to pay you a visit,

24
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,240
but I found out you moved when I got there.

25
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,319
I got this number from your department.

26
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,560
Living in the same old place was annoying.

27
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,159
Are you doing fine?

28
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,159
Is everything okay with you?

29
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,599
I'm good.

30
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,599
Thank you for your concern.

31
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,759
Do you have time tomorrow?

32
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,199
Let's meet tomorrow.

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Of course. We have to meet.

34
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,759
Well...

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
How about this?

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm usually quite busy...

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
and I'm never home.

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
How about this, Lan Qi?

39
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,919
Let's meet somewhere outside.

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
How about this?

41
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,840
Let's meet tomorrow night at 7pm.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
I'll treat you to a meal at Minglehui.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,919
No, it's on me.

44
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,319
You're being too kind.

45
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,960
You're my elder. It's the right thing to do.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
All right then.

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
See you tomorrow night.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,159
All right. I'll be waiting.

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
I'll see you there.

50
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,439
Gather around!

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,480
Why are you still chatting?

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Gather around!

53
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,319
We have a shoot at the beach this afternoon.

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Get into the same groups as before.

55
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,120
Is everyone here?

56
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,959
We're all here.

57
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
We have everyone too.

58
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,399
Why is there another one?

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
- Hurry up! - I'm coming.

60
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,000
You made so many people wait for you.

61
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,759
Which group are you in?

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I...

63
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,560
I don't have a group.

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Do you not have a group?

65
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,959
That won't do.

66
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Let me arrange it for you.

67
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,040
Our group is full, Coach.

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
We don't need anyone else.

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
Coach, our group is full too.

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Wasn't it all already planned out this morning?

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,800
Let's do this then.

72
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,439
Stand at the side for now. You'll be in a group by yourself.

73
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,720
In the next segment,

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,399
there will be three parts.

75
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,360
Look at this beautiful sight with all these girls here.

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
- You can be in pairs or trios. - I was wondering...

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,199
why you ran here in such a rush.

78
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,560
I'm in such a hurry.

79
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,639
Look at them.

80
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,639
Strike your own poses,

81
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,639
and then the photographer will take candid shots.

82
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,600
The second part is...

83
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,399
They don't pull a long face all the time like you do.

84
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,639
- "This is my job." - In this part, all of you can...

85
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,519
make your own teams.

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,759
- Exhibit your style. - Fang Lu.

87
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,279
In the third part...

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,519
Hou Jue!

89
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,040
Get up quickly.

90
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,160
Why are you so excited? Get up.

91
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,279
I'm okay.

92
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,839
- Why are you here? - I came to see you.

93
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Really?

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Come here.

95
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,439
Let me introduce you.

96
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,560
This is our coach.

97
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,959
- Hello. - This is Hou Jue.

98
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
He's so manly.

99
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,079
- He's so manly. - He's so handsome.

100
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,079
Hello, everyone.

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,600
The environment is nice here.

102
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,040
All of you beautiful girls and guys,

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
Fang Lu here...

104
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
has only just stepped into the workforce.

105
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,759
She's a bit of a simple person.

106
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,199
Also,

107
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,639
if she does anything wrong,

108
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,639
please forgive her.

109
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,759
She joined this show...

110
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,319
mainly to train herself and meet some friends.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
- Who is this? - I don't know him either.

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,439
If there's anything,

113
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,120
just come and tell me.

114
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,680
- He's so considerate. - How sweet.

115
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Okay.

116
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,279
Director.

117
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,079
Right.

118
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,560
This is for you.

119
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,879
For me?

120
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
What is this?

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,199
- It's a big necklace. - It's a necklace.

122
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,199
What do you think?

123
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,759
Hou Jue, why are you suddenly giving me...

124
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,040
such a valuable gift?

125
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Isn't it your birthday?

126
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,839
It's a birthday present.

127
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,279
My birthday is still far away.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,040
Every day is your birthday when you're happy.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
Happy birthday.

130
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,319
What do you think of it? Do you like it?

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,279
I love it. Thank you.

132
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,800
It looks so good.

133
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
No, it doesn't.

134
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,199
Fang Lu, you stay here.

135
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,000
There's a rescue mission. I need to go there.

136
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,199
Rehearse here first.

137
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,399
I have a mission. I have to go.

138
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,399
Are you leaving?

139
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,560
Take care of her for me.

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,279
Thank you. Bye, you guys.

141
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,240
- Bye. - Bye.

142
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,639
- My gosh, it's so pretty. - Look.

143
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,680
- My gosh, it's so beautiful. - It's gorgeous.

144
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,000
- It's so sparkly. - It's so beautiful.

145
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,839
Fang Lu, come here.

146
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,639
- Director. - Why did your boyfriend leave?

147
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,560
He's part of a rescue unit.

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,639
He's going to someone's rescue now.

149
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,240
After he's done,

150
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,759
he'll come to see me again.

151
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,959
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

152
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,879
Lu Lu, you're so lucky.

153
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,240
You're so blessed.

154
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,960
It's just a necklace.

155
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,360
It's not an engagement ring.

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,759
Who knows what will happen in the future?

157
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,799
Exactly.

158
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,480
He proposed to me long ago.

159
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,240
As for my engagement ring...

160
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm afraid I'll lose it while filming.

161
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,210
That's why I'm not wearing it.

162
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,919
We'll be taking wedding photos after filming this show.

163
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,399
That's great.

164
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,450
- I'm so envious. - That'll create buzz.

165
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,450
- Me too. - Fang Lu.

166
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,559
You'll stand in the center in the next group.

167
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,159
- Really? - It's a must.

168
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,799
By the way, when are you going to try on wedding dresses...

169
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,799
and take wedding photos?

170
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,840
- I... - Wan Jian Guo.

171
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,210
Director.

172
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,399
Follow them and film them when the time comes.

173
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,399
- Okay. - We'll make a special episode.

174
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,399
- All right, Director. - Go. Stand in the center position.

175
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,330
Thank you, Director. Pay attention to your emotions.

176
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,090
Okay.

177
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
- Didn't you two hear the director? - I...

178
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,679
She's standing in the center.

179
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Hurry up.

180
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,679
All right.

181
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,919
Let's drink, Mr. Wu.

182
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,399
Cheers.

183
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,090
I really didn't expect it.

184
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,559
Shi Yi is a bodyguard now.

185
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,519
That's really cool.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,039
It seems like the two of us can really click.

187
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,330
We both like girls who are capable.

188
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
Mr. Wu, I've always thought...

189
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,559
that a person's career...

190
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,879
tends to be reflected in his or her aura.

191
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,919
Especially when a girl...

192
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,399
does a really cool job,

193
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,399
her charm...

194
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,399
just naturally comes out.

195
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Lan Qi.

196
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,000
I know what you're thinking.

197
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,879
This is Shi Yi's number.

198
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
You should ask about her yourself.

199
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,159
I won't intervene.

200
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,559
It has been so many years,

201
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,090
but I can never hide it from you.

202
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Miss.

203
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Hello.

204
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,879
- Are you buying flowers, sir? - Yes.

205
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,799
But there are too many flowers.

206
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,840
I don't know how to choose.

207
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,480
Then who are you giving them to? What are they for?

208
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
They are for an old friend.

209
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,799
She's a girl.

210
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,919
She's single and very pretty.

211
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,279
Don't hesitate then.

212
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,399
You have to give her roses, of course.

213
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
How many should I get?

214
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
Take a look at that.

215
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,919
(Common Symbology of Roses: 1 rose: You're the only one for me.)

216
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,039
(51 roses: You're the only one in my heart.)

217
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,720
I'll get 51 roses then.

218
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,759
Her name happens to be a homophone of 51.

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,879
Okay, please wait a moment.

220
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,879
Thank you.

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,399
You're the only one in my heart.

222
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Bao Xiao Han.

223
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,679
Attached is the internal data...

224
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,879
that my college classmate sent me.

225
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,039
The data states that...

226
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,919
he has done renovation and decor...

227
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,200
for many luxury hotels in the US.

228
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,200
So the data is very valuable.

229
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,559
Please take a look, Xiao Han.

230
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,879
In the meeting,

231
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
my attitude wasn't very good.

232
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,879
It was my problem.

233
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,360
Please forgive me.

234
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,799
End it with "Regards, Hou Jue."

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Take a look and see if this is okay.

236
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
It's good.

237
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,080
Don't worry about it, Mr. Hou Junior.

238
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,120
The words you said at the meeting...

239
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,840
really opened my eyes.

240
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,639
I should be the one to thank you.

241
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,639
Respond to him.

242
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,639
I didn't expect...

243
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
that Bao Xiao Han...

244
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,759
is also someone with a sense of humor.

245
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm very gratified.

246
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
If we ever disagree again,

247
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
please be more direct with me.

248
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,039
It's not a fair competition between you and Bao Xiao Han.

249
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,519
You mess around at work,

250
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,039
knowing that your dad is Hou Zhi Rong.

251
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
What was it again?

252
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Borrowing someone else's power to bully others.

253
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,960
Right. Ridiculous.

254
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Isn't it good that you've figured it out yourself now?

255
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,360
It is,

256
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,600
but it would be bad if I didn't.

257
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Hello.

258
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,679
Lan Qi?

259
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,480
Okay, I'll be right out.

260
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,200
A friend of mine came by. I'm going out.

261
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Go.

262
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Lan Qi.

263
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,879
- Who is it? - Is it her boyfriend?

264
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,879
It has been a while.

265
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,799
Yes, it has been a while.

266
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm a bit surprised.

267
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Right.

268
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Here, this is for you.

269
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Thank you.

270
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,159
You really didn't have to.

271
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,279
You don't have to be so polite with me.

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't stand there. Sit there.

273
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:13,720
He's so handsome.

274
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
It must be her boyfriend.

275
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,120
I think so.

276
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,519
Ms. Shi Yi.

277
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,080
Ms. Shi Yi, you guys can sit here.

278
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,759
Have a seat.

279
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,159
It has been 10 years.

280
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,279
You haven't changed a bit.

281
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,559
No way.

282
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
You're the one who hasn't changed.

283
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,159
How did you find this place?

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,399
How else could I find you?

285
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I went to find your dad.

286
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,679
I met up with him and had dinner.

287
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
We had a good talk.

288
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,399
How are you? Have you been well?

289
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,399
Just so-so.

290
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,440
I just lived like a normal person.

291
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,240
I went abroad to school and graduated from college.

292
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,519
I felt like I should come back to work in China.

293
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm not going to leave the country anymore.

294
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,559
That's great.

295
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,600
There are many opportunities here.

296
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,519
You're capable.

297
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm sure you'll do fine.

298
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
What about you?

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Me?

300
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is everything going well?

301
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,440
It's good.

302
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Really?

303
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,879
But Mr. Wu told me everything.

304
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,120
There's no need to act tough in front of me.

305
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,639
I...

306
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,399
didn't come back too late, did I?

307
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,840
Do you have any plans for dinner?

308
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,120
Why don't we have dinner together?

309
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,119
I can't. I have to work 24 hours a day.

310
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,170
You have to have some free time, don't you?

311
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,170
For the duration of our contract, I really don't.

312
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,039
Okay.

313
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,680
I expected you to say that.

314
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,119
That's why I came here to find you.

315
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,319
So...

316
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,410
How much longer is your contract?

317
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,890
I think there are still two months left.

318
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,599
After the two months are up,

319
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,000
why don't you come and protect me?

320
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Stop joking.

321
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,079
What are you doing?

322
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,519
Shi Yi, I'm going out.

323
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,200
- Where are you going? - Is your friend here?

324
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,519
This is my old friend, Lan Qi.

325
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,799
This is my client, Hou Jue.

326
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,960
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Hou.

327
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,839
Sorry to interrupt your chat.

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,519
Why don't you talk first? I'll go out later.

329
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,890
It's fine. We're done anyway.

330
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,759
I won't disturb your work.

331
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,799
Is that so?

332
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,410
Gosh. Well...

333
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,410
I won't see you out then.

334
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,519
Okay.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll call you.

336
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,319
- Okay. - Take care.

337
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Take care.

338
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,079
Take care.

339
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,799
Where are we going?

340
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,039
Where are we going?

341
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,559
Back to the office.

342
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,000
Ms. Shi Yi, that's such a big bouquet.

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,039
That's a huge bouquet.

344
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,200
Ms. Shi Yi, who gave you such a big bouquet?

345
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Yes.

346
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,720
- Who gave her that? - Get to work!

347
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,119
Who are they from?

348
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
They're so pretty.

349
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,759
Hello.

350
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,839
Is he an ex-boyfriend?

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Is it that obvious?

352
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,480
Isn't it obvious?

353
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,170
Even if he didn't give you flowers,

354
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,319
I could tell...

355
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,839
from the vibes between you two.

356
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,240
This guy is okay.

357
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,039
He's much better than the one who was streaking last time.

358
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,839
Could you tell from just one look?

359
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,410
That one look is no ordinary look.

360
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,890
In that one look,

361
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,319
I saw right through him.

362
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,559
He didn't even dare to look me in the eye.

363
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,559
What does that mean?

364
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,079
That means he's hiding something.

365
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,279
He definitely has evil intentions.

366
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm telling you.

367
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,079
You must stay away from people like him.

368
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
He's too dangerous.

369
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,650
It's for your own good. Don't get me wrong.

370
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,039
Once you spend more time with people like him,

371
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,240
that aura will follow you too.

372
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,839
This aura will affect your life.

373
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,559
It will harm your life, child.

374
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,039
He didn't come back to get back together with you, did he?

375
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,119
Thanks to you,

376
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,799
you appeared before he had the chance to ask.

377
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,319
You're welcome.

378
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,799
"You're welcome"? Did I thank you?

379
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,759
You sure do whatever you want.

380
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,890
Well, if he really asked you,

381
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,240
would you agree to it?

382
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,799
You're not going to get married before I do, right?

383
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,559
You have to follow me around the clock.

384
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,519
If you get married,

385
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,039
what will happen to me?

386
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,079
I can't give you time to do that.

387
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,170
You cannot ever leave my sight.

388
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,650
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,319
What a troubling day.

390
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,519
There are so many problems.

391
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,559
Dad, what did you tell Lan Qi?

392
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,000
(The other party is typing.)

393
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,119
Everything.

394
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,650
Look, I'll give it some salt.

395
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,200
What's the salt for?

396
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,000
- Let me tell you. - Salt is good.

397
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
What's the reason?

398
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,000
Because... Don't let yesterday rub salt...

399
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,039
- into your wounds - Get out of here.

400
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,279
Shut your mouth.

401
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,559
He's so annoying.

402
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,799
If you add salt, these flowers will last longer.

403
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,279
Do you know that? They'll be easier to maintain.

404
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,890
No.

405
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,720
That's not how you cut it. Come on, I'll teach you.

406
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,240
It's like this. Here, look.

407
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,720
When you cut flowers, you have to...

408
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,200
Look. Cut it diagonally.

409
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,799
Put it in like this.

410
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,119
See? That will help it absorb water easily.

411
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,680
Then, the flowers will last longer.

412
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,359
- Isn't that great? - Is it like this?

413
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,680
That's right. Cut it diagonally.

414
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,039
That's right. Yes.

415
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,319
Where is he from?

416
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,680
What does he do for a living?

417
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,160
He is in hotel management.

418
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,519
I think he's managing a few resort hotels right now.

419
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,279
He has a pretty good job.

420
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,200
A man should have his own career.

421
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,920
How old is he?

422
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,359
He's in his early thirties.

423
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,799
His age is quite suitable too.

424
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,720
He has grown up and matured, so he understands you.

425
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,920
How great is that?

426
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,079
Do you know what?

427
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,839
I counted these flowers just now.

428
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,799
Guess how many roses there are.

429
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
In total?

430
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,960
Fifty-one.

431
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Why are you calling me?

432
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm saying there are 51 roses.

433
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,559
How petty.

434
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,039
That little punk...

435
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,559
I used this tactic years ago.

436
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,599
I can't believe he's using it now.

437
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,519
I'm telling you. Even I would be too embarrassed to do that.

438
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,839
How pretentious.

439
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,839
It's so tacky.

440
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,839
Did he give you 51 roses just because of your name?

441
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,480
What if your name sounded like 250?

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,079
You're so annoying.

443
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,880
You're a doofus.

444
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,319
You're so irritating.

445
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
He's tacky?

446
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,000
Tacky methods are effective.

447
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,720
How about you? You don't even know these tacky tactics.

448
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,839
Why don't you show us some trendy tactics then?

449
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,119
Gosh.

450
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,039
That's enough. Stop arranging them. Get them out of here.

451
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,240
The sight of these flowers annoys me.

452
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,720
Get out if you don't want to see them.

453
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,440
Get out? Fine. Let me tell you.

454
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,920
You guys have fun.

455
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,680
Women all fall for these stupid things.

456
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,799
You'll regret it later.

457
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,680
You call this a small trick?

458
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,200
Do you know any yourself?

459
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Let it go.

460
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,400
He's just like a child.

461
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,160
All he does is play on his phone.

462
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
He worries me.

463
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,319
I'm telling you.

464
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,160
I've already talked to the director.

465
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
The director thinks you're great.

466
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,400
He wants to do a special episode on you.

467
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,440
So regarding the rest,

468
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,519
talk to Hou Jue about it.

469
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,519
Really?

470
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,680
That's great, Mary.

471
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,599
Eat more.

472
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Okay.

473
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,720
But...

474
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
What should I tell Hou Jue?

475
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,640
Just tell him...

476
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,359
Hold on.

477
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,839
We can consider letting Ms. Fang be our brand spokesperson.

478
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,839
It's Mr. Hao, the chairman of Dreams Come True Company.

479
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
It's a done deal.

480
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,640
Earning one million a year is no longer a dream.

481
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,319
One million?

482
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
My gosh.

483
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,119
This is so cool, Mary.

484
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,079
Luck is coming my way.

485
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,200
Good things all come together.

486
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,000
This is so cool, Mary.

487
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,039
I'm going on a business trip to Dubai in a few days.

488
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,759
Can Ms. Fang come along too?

489
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,880
We'll cover all the expenses.

490
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,000
I knew it wouldn't be that simple.

491
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
A business trip?

492
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,079
Does he think no one else knows what he's thinking?

493
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,880
I won't go.

494
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,599
What's wrong?

495
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,559
This is nothing.

496
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,559
Do you not want to earn a million a year?

497
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,119
But you know what this pervert might do.

498
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Besides,

499
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,880
if Hou Jue finds out, what do I do?

500
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,119
Look at you. You're not even married yet.

501
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,119
Why are you...

502
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,200
To get you these opportunities,

503
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,039
I pray and beg people every day.

504
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,400
I go around to get resources for you.

505
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,839
I finally managed...

506
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,640
to get you a web variety show.

507
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,680
Now, we've got an endorsement.

508
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
How great is that?

509
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,279
Now, you're refusing to go.

510
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,519
Then tell me.

511
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,640
How will you compensate for my loss?

512
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,319
Then, name a price...

513
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,880
and I'll give it to you.

514
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Okay.

515
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Let's calculate this.

516
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,039
Let's just look at this endorsement for Dreams Come True.

517
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
We'll say it's a million yuan.

518
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,119
Sixty percent goes to me, so that's 600,000 yuan.

519
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,119
Give me the money.

520
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,079
How could it be that much?

521
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,319
My goodness, missy.

522
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,599
I guess you don't know the market price...

523
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,759
of endorsements nowadays.

524
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,880
My estimation might even be too low.

525
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,079
Why don't you try it?

526
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Then...

527
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,279
Then I'll pay you...

528
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,519
after I get married to Hou Jue.

529
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Look.

530
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,960
What if you don't end up getting married?

531
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,440
What if he finds out...

532
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,160
about your rough past?

533
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,079
People need to have backup plans, right?

534
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,960
Who would give up a chance to earn money?

535
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Don't worry.

536
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,759
Anyhow, as long as I have money to live on,

537
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,160
I'm one to keep my mouth shut.

538
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,119
This is delicious.

539
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,240
Come and try it.

540
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,039
I'll send him a message now.

541
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,599
What are you looking at?

542
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,839
Let me see.

543
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
It has nothing to do with you.

544
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,920
- Let me see. - Why do you want to look?

545
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,279
It's none of your business. You're not allowed to look.

546
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,599
What if you're badmouthing me?

547
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm not.

548
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,759
What kind of style is this?

549
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
When were these taken?

550
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
They were from my college days.

551
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,279
Don't look.

552
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,279
I don't see any changes.

553
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,839
That means I'm young.

554
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,599
Do you still have photos from so long ago?

555
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,279
Lan Qi sent them to me.

556
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,119
I knew it was him.

557
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,000
These tricks are so outdated.

558
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,039
You smiled so happily back then.

559
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,599
You seemed so happy-go-lucky.

560
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,279
Look at you now.

561
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,279
You look so grim all the time.

562
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm getting old.

563
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,279
I can't smile so innocently like I used to.

564
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,160
If I knew you back then,

565
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,200
I would probably be a lot nicer to you.

566
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,640
It's lucky that you didn't know me back then.

567
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,480
I was a Sanda athlete in college.

568
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,880
If I met someone as annoying as you,

569
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,519
I would definitely hit him.

570
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,880
You're a girl.

571
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,640
You keep talking about hitting people.

572
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,319
Fighting and beating people up is against the law, you know?

573
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,000
We live in a world of law now.

574
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,519
That's right, so don't fight anymore.

575
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,279
Get some rest.

576
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,559
Lu Lu.

577
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,519
You're finally here.

578
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,599
Are they already shooting?

579
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Yes.

580
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm sorry. Please don't film me.

581
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
How about this?

582
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,119
Sir.

583
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,920
Why don't you go upstairs and get ready first?

584
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
I'll explain the situation to him.

585
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,039
There's no need to film that, right?

586
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,119
- Okay, we'll go and get ready. - Thank you.

587
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,279
What's going on?

588
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
It's very simple.

589
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,359
Just help me pick out a wedding dress.

590
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,799
Pick out a wedding dress?

591
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,799
Yes.

592
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,839
Your show is pretty weird.

593
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,240
Why would a friend pick your wedding dress?

594
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,559
Aren't fiancés supposed to do that?

595
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,559
That's right.

596
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,279
I also find it strange.

597
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
But the director said...

598
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,559
he wants to film and show...

599
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,799
my aspirations for my future marriage.

600
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,359
Please help me.

601
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,119
This has nothing to do with my aspirations.

602
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,000
- Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go upstairs.

603
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,920
Many celebrities come to us for their wedding dresses...

604
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
and to plan their weddings.

605
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,680
You can also order customized designer dresses through us.

606
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,359
We're a one-stop shop.

607
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,759
You're a celebrity too, right?

608
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,839
You have a camera crew with you to pick out your wedding dress.

609
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm not a celebrity.

610
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm just a rookie.

611
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,440
Can I take a picture with you two?

612
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,160
Leave me out of it. I don't like taking photos.

613
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,559
Yes.

614
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,039
Take one photo. It's just one photo.

615
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,519
Excuse me, can you take a picture for us?

616
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,279
- Okay. - Thank you.

617
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,400
All right. Look over here.

618
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,160
One, two, three.

619
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,960
Lower your head.

620
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
One, two, three.

621
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Thank you.

622
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,680
- Let's take a look upstairs. - Okay.

623
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,240
Here's the wedding dress you asked for.

624
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,279
Right. This is our shop's best piece.

625
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,319
It's so pretty.

626
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,160
Hou Jue, does it look good?

627
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,319
Yes.

628
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,839
Where's your dressing room? I want to try it on.

629
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,319
Okay, I'll take you there.

630
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,319
Please look around.

631
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,319
- Go on. - Come.

632
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,559
- I'll get going then. - Be careful.

633
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,519
A famous designer made this.

634
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,559
Stop filming. I'm not used to this.

635
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,599
Sir, stay a little further back.

636
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,759
This is too uncomfortable for me.

637
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,319
It's so strange for me to pick one.

638
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,960
Did you and your ex-boyfriend go shopping for wedding dresses?

639
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,759
There are so many dresses here.

640
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:23,759
Have you not gone cross-eyed yet?

641
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,559
I was just asking.

642
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,240
I don't know how to pick one.

643
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,000
Does this one suit her better?

644
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
It's heavy.

645
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Take it to Fang Lu.

646
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,920
You do it. They're filming you.

647
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,720
I can't go to the dressing room.

648
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
You go.

649
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,160
Ms. Fang, you're so beautiful.

650
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,119
It's like this wedding dress was made for you.

651
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,279
Is that so?

652
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,240
- I think it looks great too. - It's beautiful.

653
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,119
Ms. Fang, you have a call.

654
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,400
You guys go out first. Let me take this call.

655
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Okay.

656
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,759
Ms. Fang is changing inside.

657
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,759
Thank you.

658
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,119
Hello, Mary.

659
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,599
I thought about it all night yesterday.

660
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,839
I really don't want to go to Dubai.

661
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,359
Besides, I think Hou Jue is a really nice guy.

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,680
I want to make things work with him.

663
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,000
If he finds out about this,

664
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,440
he might not even want to be friends with me anymore.

665
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,680
Has that old man lost his mind?

666
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,640
Why is he paying me so much?

667
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Who is it?

668
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,559
Hou Jue wants you to try this on.

669
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,519
When did you get here?

670
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,079
Hello, Mary.

671
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:13,039
I'm doomed.

672
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,329
What did I say just now?

673
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:16,360
I don't remember at all.

674
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,920
No.

675
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,079
Hou Jue's bodyguard might have heard me.

676
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,400
She was outside just now.

677
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:27,840
I don't know what she heard.

678
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
I didn't know she would use bringing me a wedding dress...

679
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,880
as an excuse to eavesdrop on me.

680
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,360
What should I do?

681
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,679
Okay.

682
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:42,920
I got it.

683
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,639
Why don't you two sit down? Take a break.

684
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:56,960
It's okay. It's what we should do. It's for work.

685
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,679
No, you're fine, but I'm uncomfortable.

686
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,519
It's okay.

687
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,809
When will your show be released?

688
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,079
Soon, I guess.

689
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,880
I don't know the exact time either.

690
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,679
Right. This is a special episode.

691
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,769
Honestly, this is quite weird.

692
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:18,360
Why would you ask a friend to help choose a wedding dress?

693
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,440
Isn't that stirring up trouble?

694
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,599
What? A friend?

695
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,880
Aren't you her fiancé?

696
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,840
Fiancé? I'm her friend.

697
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:26,039
But Fang Lu said you proposed to her...

698
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:27,599
and that you're holding your wedding really soon.

699
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,159
The director specifically arranged this shoot...

700
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,159
because of this.

701
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,079
If it's not true,

702
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,719
then we'll be in big trouble.

703
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Stop joking around.

704
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,599
I'm not kidding, Mr. Hou.

705
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,159
The whole crew knows about this. It's true.

706
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,079
Fiancé?

707
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,199
- That's right. - Me and her?

708
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,840
Yes, Fang Lu. Ms. Fang Lu.

709
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,440
What's going on?

710
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Stop filming.

711
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,480
This is just like a joke.

712
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,559
What is this? This is ridiculous.

713
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,239
Let's go. Shi Yi, let's go.

714
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,199
Don't go!

715
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:56,400
Aren't you going to tell Fang Lu?

716
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
This is nonsense.

717
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,599
This is a lie.

718
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,599
Let's go.

719
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,599
- Why are they leaving? - Hurry and call the director.

720
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,679
That's right.

721
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:10,079
Hello, Director. We've been tricked.

722
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
That's right.

723
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,119
All right.

724
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,639
- Where are they? - They left.

725
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,239
They left?

726
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,199
Why?

727
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,679
Why? That's what I want to ask you.

728
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,559
He had no idea you two were getting married.

729
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,840
Fang Lu, I'm puzzled.

730
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,480
Are you playing us for fools?

731
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,960
You're already lying even before you become popular.

732
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,809
You've got some nerve.

733
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,199
They found out.

734
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,360
Listen to me.

735
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,079
How about this? I'll get Mary to call the director...

736
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,400
and clear this up.

737
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,960
There's no point in calling.

738
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,239
Fang Lu, the director asked me to officially inform you.

739
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,679
You've been kicked off the show.

740
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,679
Let's go.

741
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,599
Don't go!

742
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,329
- It's over. - Why are they leaving?

743
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,289
Ms. Fang, are they not filming anymore?

744
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,599
- Ms. Fang. - Hou Jue must be angry.

745
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:13,289
Ms. Fang.

746
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,039
It's over.

747
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Ms. Fang.

748
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,719
Ms. Fang, don't be like this.

749
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,159
There are a lot of customers here.

750
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,679
Ms. Fang, get up.

751
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Ms. Fang.

752
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,639
Ms. Fang, hurry and get up.

753
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,559
The food at the cafeteria sucks.

754
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,809
- It tastes like crap. - By the way,

755
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,199
are there any good noodle places near our office?

756
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,840
- I love noodles. - Yes, there are.

757
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,239
There's a Chongqing noodle place downstairs.

758
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,199
- It's really good. - Downstairs?

759
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,289
Why haven't I seen it before?

760
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,639
It's diagonally opposite our building.

761
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,599
- Take me there tomorrow. - Sure.

762

763

(Mi Bao: So envious! My friend is getting married!)

764
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,809
(The groom is quite handsome too!)

765
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,199
Hello, Mary.

766
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,840
Are you free to talk right now?

767
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,559
No.

768
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,809
I really can't talk right now.

769
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,719
I still have to tell you.

770
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,199
After I changed into a wedding dress and went out,

771
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:34,119
Hou Jue had already left in a fury.

772
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,119
I don't know what he said to the director,

773
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,199
so now the crew has kicked me out.

774
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,840
What should I do, Mary?

775
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,400
His bodyguard must have eavesdropped on our call...

776
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,119
in the dressing room.

777
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,519
She must've ratted me out.

778
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:46,920
Didn't I tell you?

779
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,809
Things are hard at first.

780
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,480
Once it starts, you'll realize...

781
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,400
that things just get harder.

782
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,480
This is just the start.

783
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,920
This bit of trouble is nothing.

784
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,519
Don't worry. How about this?

785
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,239
I'll come to find you first thing tomorrow morning.

786
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:00,519
I'm here for you.

787
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,000
Just relax.

788
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,400
That's enough.

789
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,000
Stop talking, missy.

790
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,329
I'm in the middle of a discussion.

791
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:09,639
I'm working hard for your future career every day.

792
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:11,769
I'm hanging up.

793
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,289
Hello?

794
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,639
Attention all rescue units.

795
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,400
Attention all rescue units.

796
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:28,809
There is a missing hiker.

797
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,400
Assemble the rescue squad immediately.

798
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,239
Assemble the rescue squad immediately.

799
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,440
Gather around, everyone.

800
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:42,329
What is your age?

801
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
I'm 32.

802
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,679
What is your name?

803
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,719
This is a map of the area.

804
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,769
According to the rescue team headquarters' arrangements,

805
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,400
the public security bureau will be in charge of searching Zone A.

806
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,599
The armed police will be responsible for Zone B.

807
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,480
We'll coordinate with them and search Zone C.

808
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,400
The missing person's name is Shi Ai Shan.

809
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,639
He's a 36-year-old male.

810
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,769
He's a television station writer and director.

811
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,039
The last time he spoke to his family...

812
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,400
was about six hours ago.

813
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:09,239
They haven't heard from him since.

814
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,559
We've already sent his photo...

815
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,239
and his movements to everyone's phones.

816
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,239
Take a look.

817
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:16,079
The weather is a bit complicated tonight.

818
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,329
Be safe.

819
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:18,809
Do you have any questions?

820
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:19,880
- No. - No.

821
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay, let's go.

822
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
- Yes! - Yes!

823
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Let's go!

Captain.

825
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,440
What's going on here?
