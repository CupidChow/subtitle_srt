(Episode 16)

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,599
I do? I do.

5
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,760
My soul can't get any more interesting.

6
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,319
I'm too interesting.

7
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,560
Not only am I good-looking, but I also have an interesting soul.

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,000
This kind of man...

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,359
is top quality!

10
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,280
We have arrived.

11
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,879
It's right here.

12
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,680
I live on the 15th floor.

13
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,120
All these years,

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,370
I've never been as happy...

15
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,240
and cheerful...

16
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,120
as I was today.

17
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,159
Thank you, Dr. Qian.

18
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,840
I took up your whole day.

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,879
You're welcome.

21
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,159
Loneliness is an obsession.

22
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,240
If it kicks in again,

23
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,120
Dr. Qian is always on call.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,199
It's a deal.

25
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,840
It's a deal.

26
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,199
It's a deal.

27
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
I have a favor to ask.

28
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,840
If I tell you,

29
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,879
please don't be upset.

30
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,680
What's the matter?

31
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,199
I was thinking...

32
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,560
can we keep this kind of doctor-patient relationship...

33
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,879
a secret for now?

34
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,840
As you know,

35
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,680
if different relationships get mixed together, I'm afraid...

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,959
Say no more.

37
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
I understand.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,240
Thank you.

39
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,879
I also have a request.

40
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,319
Tell me.

41
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,170
Can you stop saying thank you?

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,639
Okay, I promise you.

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,170
My seat belt.

44
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
It sure does its job well at crucial moments.

45
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,240
All right. It's late.

46
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,519
I'll get going then.

47
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll unbuckle it for you.

48
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Good night.

49
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Good night.

50
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,959
Sweet dreams.

51
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Old man.

52
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,680
Bye.

53
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,720
Bye, little girl.

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
I'll watch you go in.

55
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
You go.

56
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
I'll watch you go first.

57
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,839
Okay.

58
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,399
...that flashed by

59
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,759
In your world

60
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,120
Are there traces of shining stars passing by?

61
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,399
"I'm going up now, old man."

62
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,040
"Bye, little girl."

63
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,759
Old man.

64
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,480
You're my little apple

65
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
- I couldn't love you enough... - Ms. Zhang.

66
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,120
- You're back. - Yes, I went to the market.

67
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,279
I couldn't love you enough

68
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,519
Fire

69
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,600
You're my little...

70
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,240
Fire

71
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,399
You're my little apple

72
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,720
I couldn't love you enough

73
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,959
Red...

74
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,800
My gosh.

75
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,959
Why is it so messy?

76
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
The wind is so strong.

77
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,680
Why didn't that kid close the curtains?

78
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,279
That scared the life out of me! What are you doing?

79
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,439
No. No, look at me.

80
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,000
Sleep.

81
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,279
Go back to sleep.

82
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,399
Go back to sleep. This is great.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,480
We drank too much.

84
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,799
My back.

85
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,159
Ms. Zhang, what are you so happy about?

86
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,000
We...

87
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,039
didn't...

88
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,879
Finally.

89
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,240
This is great.

90
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
No, Ms. Zhang.

91
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,000
Yesterday,

92
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,679
I wanted to welcome Shi Yi back,

93
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
so I cooked a meal for her.

94
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,399
We had two bottles of wine with the meal.

95
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,399
Then we fell asleep after having a few drinks.

96
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,879
We fell asleep.

97
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,360
Behave yourself this time.

98
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,519
Stop stirring up trouble.

99
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,399
It's time to settle down.

100
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,480
I don't get into trouble.

101
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,039
Look at you. What are you thinking?

102
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,480
What do I think of what?

103
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,210
You never think about the important things.

104
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,559
You've grown so big for nothing.

105
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,919
You reek of alcohol.

106
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,159
Go. Hurry and take a shower.

107
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,159
Girls don't like stinky men.

108
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,159
Go.

109
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480
Go on.

110
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,090
Don't forget to put on some cologne too.

111
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,559
Look at this kid.

112
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Why are you being like this? Just teach me.

113
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
- Hello. - Hello.

114
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Who are you looking for?

115
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm here to see Mr. Zhao.

116
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,039
- Do you have an appointment? - Yes.

117
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,399
- Okay, please wait a moment. - Thank you.

118
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,279
Here's my business card.

119
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
Mr. Lan.

120
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,200
- Hello. - Hello.

121
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,559
- Have a seat. - Please sit.

122
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,320
Mr. Lan.

123
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,279
Hotel security is also within our scope of work.

124
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,320
If you have any specific requests,

125
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,919
we'll try our best to satisfy you.

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,559
It's like this.

128
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,639
Our hotel will officially open in two months.

129
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,159
We're recruiting security guards now.

130
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
That's why I want to hire...

131
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,879
an experienced security guard from your company...

132
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,480
to come and formulate rules and train people.

133
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,039
No problem.

134
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,919
Our company has a lot of experts in hotel security.

135
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
Mr. Zhao, regarding the candidate,

136
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,200
I already have an idea.

137
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,639
I'd like to hire Wu Shi Yi.

138
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,799
Did you also see the video online?

139
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
Thank you for thinking highly of our team members.

140
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,240
But unfortunately,

141
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,559
Wu Shi Yi is currently assigned to a mission.

142
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,759
There's still more than a month left in her contract.

143
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,840
Didn't she already get dismissed?

144
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
No.

145
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,120
It was just a small misunderstanding.

146
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,240
The client has already asked her to return to work.

147
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,240
It happened yesterday.

148
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,919
Mr. Lan, how did you know...

149
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,360
that Wu Shi Yi was dismissed?

150
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
Shi Yi and I are old classmates.

151
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,240
That's very unfortunate then.

152
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,080
How about this?

153
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,639
Do you have any other candidates in mind?

154
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,440
Then it's okay, Mr. Zhao.

155
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,919
I don't need anyone for now.

156
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,320
If I need someone in the future,

157
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I'll reach out to you again.

158
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,679
I'm very sorry.

159
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,919
Thank you.

160
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,360
Tian Min.

161
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Why are you so dressed up today?

162
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
- Is that so? - Yes, Ms. Tian Min.

163
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,000
You curled your hair so beautifully.

164
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,480
You changed your lipstick too.

165
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
You really look so pretty.

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
Gosh, Tian Min.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,399
Why do you look so pretty?

168
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,000
I almost didn't recognize you.

169
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,120
That's enough.

170
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,440
I just changed my look.

171
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,360
Dress like this from now on. You look so pretty.

172
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,879
- That's right. - I'll get going now.

173
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,559
You should hurry. I need to get to work.

174
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,240
- Dress like this from now on. - Bye.

175
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
Why are you dressed like that all of a sudden?

176
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,159
It's for a blind date.

177
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,000
(Delete)

178
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm just going to buy groceries.

179
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,639
Why are you following me?

180
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,120
If I don't help you, who else will?

181
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,639
I'm strong anyway.

182
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,399
All right. Let go.

183
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,720
- Watch where you're touching. - Boss, are you ticklish?

184
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Dolly.

185
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
They're back.

186
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
Do you have too much time on your hands lately?

187
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
It seems that you don't have enough work to do.

188
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,759
Should I increase your workload?

189
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,879
What did I do?

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,919
I really felt like we were meant to be just now.

191
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,919
Girls should be more reserved.

192
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,919
Don't say that so casually.

193
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,279
It'll be hard to explain if other people hear you.

194
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,639
- What is there to explain? - Put your energy into your work.

195
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,120
- Hai Xing. - That's just how I am.

196
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,399
Ms. Shi Yi.

197
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,759
Shi Yi?

198
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,120
This is a big surprise.

199
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,559
- It's a hug of friendship. - You can't hug her, but I can.

200
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,879
Certain people have been bullying me while you weren't around.

201
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,600
Now that you're here, I feel comforted.

202
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
I can even do whatever I want.

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,879
All right, stop.

204
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,679
Have you two eaten?

205
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,639
Hurry up and tell Mr. Tian to make two plates of fried rice.

206
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,080
Add two eggs. Let's have a good chat.

207
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
All right.

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,000
I need the details. What's going on? Why did you suddenly come here?

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,360
Why didn't you tell me?

210
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,080
I obviously can't let my people suffer, can I?

211
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,440
Isn't that right?

212
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Besides, if she goes to work for someone else,

213
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,720
what if she encounters someone...

214
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:27,759
even more annoying and troublesome than I am?

215
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,879
Wouldn't I be outshined then?

216
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,039
I have to maintain the top rank in her heart.

217
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
That's right.

218
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,200
If he finds someone else...

219
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,440
who can tolerate him better than I can,

220
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,080
wouldn't I be outshined then?

221
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,279
That's why...

222
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,519
we should drink to that.

223
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,360
Let's drink.

224
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
Welcome back.

225
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
You have to finish it.

226
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,799
- Bottoms up. - Let's do it.

227
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,399
You have to drink it all.

228
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,360
Shi Yi, you were so cool in that video last time.

229
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
A mysterious woman takes down a thief with a flying kick!

230
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
You were even cooler than Jen Yu!

231
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,799
Who is Jen Yu?

232
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,679
My royal parents are gracing me with their presence today.

233
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,159
Their humble servant is going to buy groceries first.

234
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,679
Then I'll pick them up at the bus station in the afternoon.

235
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,919
Hello.

236
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,399
Hello, is this the humble servant?

237
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,759
I'm your master.

238
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,120
Why are you becoming more and more humorous now?

239
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,279
Yes, my parents,

240
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,879
my younger cousin, and her family are coming to see me.

241
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,519
There are so many people.

242
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,240
Why don't I send you a van?

243
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,519
It'll be more convenient...

244
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,000
to go out with such a big family that way.

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,279
It's okay.

246
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,759
It's very convenient for us to take a taxi or public transportation.

247
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,559
How can you take public transportation?

248
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,650
There are so many of you.

249
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,650
You'll need at least two taxis.

250
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,519
My van would be enough to hold all of you.

251
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,759
All right?

252
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,599
There's really no need. That's too much trouble.

253
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,920
Taxi!

254
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,359
Taxi!

255
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,119
I just got into the taxi. Keep talking.

256
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,240
It's just a car. Don't think too much of it.

257
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,410
Isn't it good to make your family happy?

258
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,170
If that so...

259
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,519
All right then.

260
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,759
Deduct it from my coaching fee.

261
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,039
Don't worry.

262
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,680
I guarantee I won't deduct it.

263
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,119
You silly girl.

264
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm happy to see you happy.

265
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,200
After all these years, I suddenly realize...

266
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,920
I've been understanding the phrase...

267
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,720
"Finding pleasure in helping others" wrong.

268
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,890
It's a different kind of pleasure.

269
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,650
Helping others is to make myself happy.

270
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,920
Little girl, thank you for giving me this opportunity.

271
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,240
I'll ask the driver to send the car right away.

272
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,200
Okay, since you're so sincere,

273
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,519
I reluctantly accept.

274
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,799
- I'm hanging up. - Bye.

275
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,039
Xiao Yan!

276
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,720
Dad! Mom!

277
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,240
We're all here.

278
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,480
Mom.

279
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
Look at you. You're still so skinny.

280
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,720
Stop trying to lose weight.

281
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,440
You look better when you're chubbier.

282
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,319
I'm not on a diet.

283
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,650
Aunt. Uncle.

284
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,920
Look, it's rare for our whole family to be able to get together,

285
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,410
so we all came.

286
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,200
Come on. Let's get in the car. We'll talk at home.

287
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,890
- Okay. - Let's go.

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,170
Dad, is your luggage heavy?

289
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,519
I'm fine. I can push it.

290
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,720
Mom, Dad's shoes are nice.

291
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,440
He's always reluctant to wear them, but he wore them to see you.

292
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,119
Sweetheart, did you buy this car?

293
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,559
No, I borrowed it from a friend.

294
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,839
What a big car.

295
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,480
Our whole family can fit in here.

296
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,519
Xiao Yan, did you become a boss?

297
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,759
A friend of mine lent me this car. Load the luggage inside.

298
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,410
- Mom, get in the car. - Get in the car first.

299
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,000
Leave the luggage here. I'll do it.

300
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,890
- Give it to me. - He'll do it.

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,119
Mom, here.

302
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,599
- Take good care of it. - Put it inside.

303
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,799
- Get on first. - Look at this car.

304
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,519
Get in the car after you load the luggage.

305
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,759
- It's spacious. - Come on.

306
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,480
You sit in the front.

307
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,240
Okay, I...

308
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,000
- Mom, be careful. - That's about it.

309
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,680
Get in.

310
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,279
Big cars sure are comfortable.

311
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,079
When I have money,

312
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,890
I'll buy you an even bigger one.

313
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,650
What a good son-in-law. Good.

314
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,480
Qian Qian, which friend lent you this car?

315
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,359
A good friend.

316
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,279
Is it a man or woman?

317
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,200
Mom, just enjoy the ride.

318
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,890
Does it matter if it's a boy or a girl?

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
- Of course it does. - Of course.

320
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,480
He's your boyfriend, right?

321
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,319
Listen to me.

322
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Don't let him get away this time.

323
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,410
What do you mean?

324
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,599
This time, it's him...

325
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,839
who should be afraid that our Qian Qian will get away.

326
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,519
- Isn't that right, Qian Qian? - Exactly.

327
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,119
Qian Qian, if it's your boyfriend,

328
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,359
ask him to come out.

329
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,890
Let us all meet him.

330
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,170
We can give you some advice.

331
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,890
- Yes. - Yes, show him to us.

332
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,000
- Yes. - That's right.

333
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:42,480
That's enough.

334
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,599
This friend of mine is indeed a man.

335
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,680
But he's really not my boyfriend.

336
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,240
Qian Qian sure is remarkable.

337
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
This time,

338
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,519
you guys have connections in this big city now.

339
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,319
My connections are yours too.

340
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,759
If you guys like it here,

341
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
you can come anytime.

342
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,960
- Keep your word, Aunt. - No.

343
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,759
Stop. I feel like throwing up.

344
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,240
Dad, hang in there!

345
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,480
This is someone else's car. Don't puke here.

346
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Where's the bag?

347
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,839
- Throw up. Vomit everything. - He's fine.

348
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,039
Old man, Mom and Dad are very happy.

349
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Even if I wasn't dizzy before, you're making me dizzy now.

350
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,079
Thank you.

351
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,170
Fine, I won't do it again.

352
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,839
Do you want some tangerines to suppress it?

353
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,799
It's okay.

354
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,920
Dad, are you feeling better?

355
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,279
I'm fine. I really am.

356
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,599
Your dad is just meant to be poor.

357
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,599
You're right.

358
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,890
You're sitting in such a nice car, but you threw up so badly.

359
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,359
- I was just happy. - Let's get in the car.

360
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,650
- Hello, Mr. Hou. - Good morning.

361
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,319
- Mr. Hou. - Li Li.

362
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,599
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

363
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,720
Not yet.

364
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
I knew it.

365
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,440
Breakfast is good for you.

366
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,319
- Good morning, Mr. Hou. - Good morning.

367
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,279
You're looking good today.

368
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,960
Do you have a new boyfriend?

369
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,720
- No. - I'm kidding.

370
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,839
By the way,

371
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,480
arrange a room for me tonight at the club.

372
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,240
All right.

373
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,160
(Jinzhonghuan Serviced Apartment)

374
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,839
- We're here, right? - Are we here?

375
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,319
We're here.

376
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,880
- Are we staying here? - Be careful.

377
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,039
It's on the 15th floor.

378
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,400
Come on.

379
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,960
- Come on. - Take it slow, Dad.

380
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,519
- Is it this building? - Is it this building?

381
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Uncle.

382
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,880
It's so tall.

383
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,799
- Be careful. - I'll get your luggage. Relax.

384
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,920
Open the trunk and grab your things.

385
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,359
I'll do it.

386
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,759
- Get the luggage. - Yes.

387
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,359
- Let me do it. - I'll do it.

388
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,000
Pass it over. Hurry up.

389
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,519
Sweetie.

390
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,480
Give the key to your cousin.

391
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,079
Mom, it's Unit 1503. You guys go up first.

392
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,079
- I'll be up in a minute. - Okay.

393
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,119
- Okay. - Go up first.

394
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,279
Okay, Qian Qian.

395
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,960
Why are you here?

396
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,079
I just sent you a message.

397
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,440
You probably didn't see it.

398
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,880
I went to the station to pick people up.

399
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,400
I didn't check my phone because I was driving.

400
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,519
I know.

401
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,240
I saw your post.

402
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
Your family is here, right?

403
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,680
- Yes. - At 4:15pm at the North Station.

404
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,000
I came on the dot.

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,240
So tonight,

406
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,119
get your family to come and eat at my place.

407
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,960
I already have someone preparing dinner for them.

408
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,559
I can treat your parents to a welcome dinner...

409
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,240
with some of our best dishes.

410
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,920
Thank you, but it's okay.

411
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,079
Considering our relationship, there's no need to thank me.

412
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,759
You must be so happy to see your parents.

413
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,119
Make sure to take them out for a nice dinner tonight...

414
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,519
- to welcome them here. - Let's go after they've settled in.

415
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,680
It's really okay.

416
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,319
I've already made dinner plans tonight.

417
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,400
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

418
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,519
If there's a chance...

419
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,119
If there's a chance, let's eat together, okay?

420
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,319
I'm going upstairs.

421
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,559
Wait, Qian Qian.

422
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,240
Please say hi to your parents for me then.

423
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,440
On my way here,

424
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,200
I saw someone selling balloons.

425
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
Since your family is here,

426
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,079
these can bring a little joy to them.

427
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,119
Hai Xing.

428
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,000
You know what?

429
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,799
You have...

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,480
to let go of some things...

431
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,960
to have a good start.

432
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,519
Hai Xing.

433
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,039
Why don't you understand?

434
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,359
Don't waste your time on me. I'm serious.

435
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,480
It's pointless.

436
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,960
Do you...

437
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,440
have a boyfriend now?

438
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,599
I didn't tell you...

439
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,759
because I didn't want to upset you.

440
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,279
But I'm telling you now. Yes, I have a boyfriend.

441
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,599
Bye.

442
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,079
I wasn't hiding it from you.

443
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,720
I just didn't want to bring it up.

444
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,640
Who told you?

445
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,880
It was Zhu Da Peng.

446
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
I sent the invitation...

447
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,599
to the place where you guys used to live.

448
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:33,000
When Zhu Da Peng received the invitation, he told me...

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,119
that you had already moved out.

450
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,279
That makes me not want to go even more.

451
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,759
I don't want things to be awkward when I see him.

452
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,279
Shi Yi, just come.

453
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,240
This is all the more reason to go.

454
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,119
All of us girls were so angry when we heard about it.

455
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,200
I'm telling you.

456
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,720
You must look extra pretty that day and dazzle them.

457
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,160
Show Zhu Da Peng...

458
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,359
that you're much better off without him.

459
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,960
Shi Yi, I've got something to do.

460
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,160
You have to come that day.

461
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,920
- I... - We're all waiting for you.

462
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,759
Who are you chatting with during work hours...

463
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,519
instead of keeping an eye on me?

464
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,359
It's my childhood friend.

465
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,720
She's getting married this weekend.

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,240
She's getting married?

467
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,119
That's nice.

468
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,680
Why aren't you going then?

469
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,680
I don't want to.

470
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,240
Why not?

471
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,319
Are you worried I'll be busy this weekend so you won't make it?

472
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,319
It's okay.

473
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,359
I'm going to a wedding this weekend too.

474
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,079
Are you attending one too?

475
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,559
Yes. It's your childhood friend's wedding.

476
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,559
What's wrong? Do you still not want to go?

477
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,559
Is that streaker going?

478
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,279
Is that why you're embarrassed to go?

479
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,880
Let me tell you.

480
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:47,119
That's more of a reason to go.

481
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,400
Why?

482
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,160
You have to show that streaker...

483
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,519
how glamorous you are now.

484
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Isn't that right?

485
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,119
You need to make him feel threatened.

486
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,680
You have to let him know this.

487
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,960
"You didn't treasure me before,"

488
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,960
"but now, I'm the one who despises seeing you."

489
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
"I have to settle things with you."

490
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,240
Let him see how radiant you are now.

491
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,200
You're the brightest star wherever you go.

492
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
Isn't that right?

493
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,799
- Are you thirsty? Have some coffee. - I don't want coffee.

494
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
- You must teach him a lesson. - You're thirsty.

495
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,400
You have to teach him a lesson.

496
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,920
You have to tell him what's right and wrong.

497
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,640
Show him the person you are now.

498
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,440
Right? You are independent.

499
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,319
If you had married him back then,

500
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,920
you would just be someone's wife,

501
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,279
working 9 to 5 every day.

502
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,920
You would still have to do housework when you get home.

503
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,759
After giving birth, you would have to raise the child...

504
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,839
while working.

505
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,920
Think about it.

506
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,799
At your friend's wedding, he'll be there too.

507
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,039
He'll sit here and you'll sit here.

508
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,440
You'll go in with me...

509
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,480
with your arms linked with mine.

510
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,839
You have such a wonderful man right next to you.

511
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,079
He'll be so jealous.

512
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,640
He'll be so envious.

513
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,839
- That's enough. - He'll feel so inferior.

514
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,720
And then you'll crush him when he is down.

515
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,880
- Provoke him. - No.

516
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,000
Let him...

517
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,319
- Hello. She said she'll go. - That's my phone.

518
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,359
- She's going. She'll be there soon. - Don't talk nonsense.

519
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,960
Go. I'll take you there this weekend.

520
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,319
- How about it? - No.

521
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,440
- All right? - No.

522
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,079
- Go. - No.

523
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,200
Go.

524
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,440
I don't want to.

525
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
- The dishes have all been served. - Give me more.

526
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,000
- Come on. - You're drinking too much.

527
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,359
- Come on. - Thank you.

528
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,400
Don't drink so much.

529
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,000
It's okay, Aunt. Today is a happy day. Drink more.

530
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,359
- That's right. - Uncle, you have some too.

531
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,599
Pour him some more.

532
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,839
- That's enough. - Give it to me.

533
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,839
My uncle can't drink as much as you.

534
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,440
Pour some for yourself too.

535
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,400
Dad, Mom,

536
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,480
Uncle, Aunt,

537
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
my dear cousin, and my cousin-in-law.

538
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,240
Stop taking pictures.

539
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,279
I have to drive today,

540
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,839
so I'll drink a toast to you with this instead of alcohol.

541
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,160
I want to welcome Aunt, Uncle,

542
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
my cousin, and my cousin-in-law.

543
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,200
I hope you'll enjoy the food,

544
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,160
have fun, and have a comfortable stay here, okay?

545
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,759
- Okay! Let's drink. - Thank you for having us.

546
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,200
Let's drink. Okay.

547
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,480
Slow down.

548
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,400
These dishes look so pretty. They must be delicious.

549
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,319
This is better than all the restaurants in our county.

550
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,839
Mom, if you think it's delicious, eat more.

551
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,720
Qian Qian, this must be expensive.

552
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,079
How much did it cost?

553
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,440
Dad, don't worry about it.

554
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,359
A friend of mine...

555
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,240
heard that you and Mom came to see me,

556
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,720
so he especially prepared a feast for you.

557
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,480
This friend of yours is awesome.

558
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,240
- Come on, let's eat. - This is delicious.

559
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,359
Xiao Yan, I admire you so much.

560
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,720
You're my role model.

561
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,119
Don't say that.

562
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,839
You're the one who's my role model.

563
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,119
I want to learn from you now.

564
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,799
I should find a good man, get married,

565
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,200
and have a child soon.

566
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,279
Am I right, Mom?

567
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,839
Qian Qian, you sure hit the nail on the head.

568
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,480
This can't wait any longer.

569
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,400
You've delayed it long enough.

570
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,880
Don't hesitate anymore.

571
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,799
I think this friend of yours is quite nice.

572
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,079
Mom, this meat is really good.

573
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
You never want to listen to me talk about this.

574
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
Drink to Xiao Yan.

575
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,960
Bottoms up.

576
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,119
Stop it.

577
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,279
- Xiao Yan. - Xiao Yan.

578
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,039
Let us drink to you.

579
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,839
Don't stand up. Sit down. We're a family.

580
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,079
Come on.

581
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,799
Mr. Hou, would you like anything else?

582
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,200
No, I don't have an appetite.

583
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Okay.

584
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,559
It was a great club and the food was great too.

585
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,039
I feel so blessed that I'm in a daze.

586
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,559
You'll be more and more dazed in the future.

587
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,200
Mom, have some prawns.

588
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,519
You eat some.

589
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,519
You've been busy all day.

590
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,519
Eat more.

591
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,359
Mom, I brought two more pillows.

592
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,240
It's too cramped here. Why don't you go to a hotel?

593
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,720
What a waste of money.

594
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
The whole family cramped together here will be so lively.

595
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,519
- Exactly. - Xiao Yan.

596
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,039
Xiao Yan.

597
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,799
- Come here. - Mom, I'm going over there.

598
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,880
Xiao Yan, come here.

599
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,200
- What is it? Where are you? - I'm here.

600
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,720
Why aren't you cleaning up your things?

601
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,240
- My mom will do it. - Why did you call me?

602
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,640
I want water. Can you get me some water?

603
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,119
You brat.

604
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,319
Move aside.

605
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Dad, you drank so much.

606
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,039
Why are you standing so high up? Don't fall.

607
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,079
- It's okay. - Come down.

608
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,000
- Hurry up and come down. - I'll do it.

609
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,599
You're tipsy. You might fall.

610
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,599
- Get down. - You...

611
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,880
You won't admit defeat, will you? Let's continue drinking later then.

612
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,079
Sure, let's drink. Let's do it.

613
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,279
- Don't. - Xiao Yan.

614
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,920
Is there anything else you need help with here?

615
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,119
I need something. Go and buy 2l of Baijiu.

616
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,759
Your uncle and I will drink until we pass out.

617
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,039
Don't buy it. Don't cause any trouble.

618
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,279
Go and help your wife clean up. It's too messy.

619
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,759
What was I going to do? I'm going to get water.

620
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,880
Don't fall.

621
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,240
- Are you still not done yet? - Do you admit defeat or not?

622
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,680
If not, let's see who can drink more.

623
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,960
All right. Just you wait.

624
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,200
You two will sleep on the floor tonight...

625
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,519
- and we'll sleep on the bed. - No problem.

626
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,319
Hurry up and lay out the mat.

627
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,799
Hurry up and then we'll drink.

628
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,160
Be careful.

629
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,359
It's actually quite spacious on the floor.

630
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,880
Of course. We won't fall off.

631
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,279
No matter what, we won't fall off.

632
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,720
- Tonight... - Let's have fun tonight.

633
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,880
Yes.

634
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,440
Dad. Mom.

635
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,279
Let's take a family photo.

636
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,640
Sure.

637
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,039
- All right. - Yes.

638
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,480
Pei Pei! Pei Pei, come out.

639
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,799
We're taking a photo.

640
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,200
Wait for us!

641
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,920
You can't leave us out of the photo.

642
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,160
Look at the camera.

643
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
Find the camera. Come on.

644
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,640
Wait a minute. Move the chairs.

645
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,960
- Hurry up. - Wait.

646
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,000
Come on. Let's do it.

647
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,319
- Let me fix my hair. - Here we go.

648
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,680
- Here we go. - I'm fixing my hair.

649
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,880
One, two, three.

650
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,039
Cheese.

651
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,329
You're up so early.

652
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,639
What's the matter?

653
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Are you ready?

654
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,599
Ready for what?

655
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,809
I'm taking you to get a makeover.

656
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,840
That'll be a bit difficult.

657
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:57,719
Hurry up, everyone.

658
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,840
I'm taking you guys out for fun but you keep dawdling.

659
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
If you were in my company,

660
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
you'd all be fired.

661
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Hurry and get in the car.

662
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,809
Aunt, it's an automatic door.

663
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,840
You just need to pull it once. You don't have to pull hard.

664
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,519
Mom, get in the car.

665
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,809
Hurry up. Speed it up.

666
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,599
Ms. Qian.

667
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,079
Ms. Qian.

668
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,199
Mr. Hou asked me to come...

669
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,719
and give you the keys to his villa in the suburbs.

670
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:18,440
He said you can bring your family there.

671
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,920
You can stay as long as you want.

672
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,360
The address is in the envelope.

673
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,000
- A villa? - A villa?

674
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,719
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

675
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,440
- Mom, did you hear that? - Are we staying in a villa?

676
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,480
We're going to a villa.

677
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,599
All right, get in the car first.

678
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,920
This is great.

679
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,079
I'm glad I came.

680
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,199
Thank you.

681
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,809
I've never stayed in a villa before.

682
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,329
Be careful, Dad. Are you still not awake?

683
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,329
Uncle, hurry and get in the car.

684
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:40,519
- Thank you, Xiao Yan. - All right, stop talking. Get in.

685
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:41,639
Come on, hurry.

686
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,639
Mom, let me make a call.

687
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,480
Hello.

688
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:07,289
You lent me a car and now, you're letting me use your villa.

689
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,559
- I really... - What are you saying?

690
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,440
There's no need to be so polite to me.

691
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,289
Hou Jue and I rarely get to go to that villa.

692
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:17,920
That house is always empty.

693
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,679
It's great for you to stay there.

694
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,519
Normally, if I have friends or clients who come...

695
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,559
and don't want to stay at a hotel,

696
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,239
I generally arrange for them to live in that villa.

697
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:29,769
If you really are my friend,

698
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,840
don't act so formal with me, all right?

699
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,360
- But I... - There's no reason to refuse.

700
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,000
Think about how your family...

701
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,360
will be happy, joyful,

702
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,480
and comfortable in a big space.

703
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,920
Hurry and take them there, okay?

704
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,199
I'm busy with something here, so I won't talk with you any longer.

705
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:00,329
Old man, thank you.

706
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:02,159
Okay, bye.

707
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,960
Let's see what she says.

708
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,079
Let's go upstairs and pack up first.

709
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,809
We're moving.

710
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,769
- We're moving to the villa. - We're moving.

711
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:24,769
Let's go.

712
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,159
- Hurry up and get off. - Let's go and pack up.

713
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,519
Come on.

714
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,360
- I'm so happy. - We're moving.

715
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,599
Dad, you sobered up once you heard we're staying in a villa.

716
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,960
You didn't even close the door.

717
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We're going to stay in a villa!

718
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,000
I guess no one will be snoring tonight.

719
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:46,599
Ai Mi.

720
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,769
Hello, darling.

721
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,199
- You're finally here. - Hello.

722
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:53,119
Shi Yi, I've missed you so much.

723
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,599
You were so cool on the racetrack last time.

724
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,880
Look at your driving skills.

725
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,039
You must teach me when you have time.

726
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,289
No problem.

727
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,079
I'm sorry for troubling you today.

728
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,239
No problem. It's what I should do.

729
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,480
Come, sit here.

730
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,079
Come, sit here.

731
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,769
Xiao Dan, I'm leaving my Shi Yi to you now.

732
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,289
Don't worry. Shi Yi is already naturally pretty.

733
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,199
I'll definitely make her look glamorous.

734
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,679
Let's go, Young Master Hou.

735
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,360
I'll pick an outfit for you too.

736
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,840
You guys can start here.

737
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,960
What should we do?

738
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,159
Look at your face shape.

739
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,400
Have a seat first.

740
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,039
I'll get someone to bring you two cups of coffee.

741
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,079
I'll pick out an outfit for her.

742
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,639
Okay. I can trust you to take care of this.

743
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,840
Make yourself at home.

744
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,519
Emma, make two coffees for Mr. Hou Junior.

745
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,239
Lisa.

746
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,679
Bring this outfit to Xiao Dan. Tell her that she'll wear this one.

747
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,880
- Okay. - Go.

748
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,960
Why are you still loitering?

749
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,159
We already brought you coffee. Hurry and sit down.

750
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,400
It's okay. Don't worry about me. Carry on with your work.

751
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,159
- We're here. - Let's go.

752
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,440
- Let's go. - Sweetie, is it here?

753
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,289
Pei Pei, is this it?

754
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,809
Xiao Yan, it is here. This is No. 36.

755
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:24,920
It's huge.

756
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,119
What's wrong?

757
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,400
This place has been empty for so long. It's full of dust.

758
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,440
Everything is great about this house,

759
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,119
but it's such a hassle to clean.

760
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,920
Yet you still want to live in a big house.

761
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,039
You two take a break.

762
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,360
Boss!

763
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,360
It's like this.

764
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,920
The subdistrict office asked me to notify you.

765
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,079
They said that at 10am today,

766
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,519
you have to go...

767
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:19,000
to their fire drill or something.

768
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,289
The fire inside of me hasn't even been put out yet.

769
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,329
Then you should cut down on chili peppers, boss.

770
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:28,039
Why don't I go and buy you some anti-inflammatory pills?

771
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:29,880
What do you mean?

772
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
Didn't you say there's a fire inside of you?

773
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:34,039
Disappear.
