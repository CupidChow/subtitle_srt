00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,600
This is my treat.

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,310
Your order is still being wrapped up by Brother Tian in the kitchen.

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,880
- Try it first. <br> - Okay.

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,580
- Please try it. <br> - Thanks. Okay.

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,900
Should I get Hai Xing here to chat with you?

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,800
Okay.

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Great. Eat.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,340
Dipping Char Siew roast pork in chili past, you're the only one who does that.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,390
I came to eat in your restaurant, but you wouldn't even say hello?

28
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,990
Sit for a while.

29
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,040
Your presence is welcome.

30
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,640
I thought you didn't want to come.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,960
I didn't originally want to come.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,160
But your restaurant's fried rice is charming.

33
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,990
Then... This matter is over?

34
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,060
This matter...

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,390
This matter is mainly because I don't have enough friends.

36
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,160
So when I find a friend, I put up with them.

37
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,500
That's true. You are someone who most people don't like talking with you. Quite pitiful.

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,450
My friend is even more pitiful.

39
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,990
I heard that he is getting drunk and hurting himself every day.

40
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,620
He is in deep distress.

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,380
It's okay. He can still live.

42
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,080
His life isn't that good, is it?

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,910
- It'll make do. <br> - That's great then.

44
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,310
Eat food only? Not drinking anything?

45
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,770
I'm waiting for the boss to arrange it.

46
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,690
<i>Thanks.</i>

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,790
Can you change your stingy problem?

48
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,240
Two big guys only get one small bottle of beer?

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,010
It's a foreign beer, very expensive.

50
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,450
Come.

51
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,870
You...

52
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,340
Drink up this chili beer, from now on...

53
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,840
Don't waste time talking, just drink.

54
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,950
What kind of drinking is this?

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,400
Have you been drinking this way lately?

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,460
That... That jade pendant of mine...

57
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,780
Is it with you?

58
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,350
I've kept it well for you. I'll get it for you in a while.

59
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,200
Hurry and give it to me, and I'll send you the money.

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,770
Scram.

61
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,590
That money... forget about it. I dont' deserve that money.

62
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,110
That money isn't mine, either.

63
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,350
It's not mine, either.

64
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,550
Fine. I'll go get it for you shortly, and you can hurry to take it away.

65
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,740
I won't ask for any safekeeping fee.

66
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,190
Why do you do accounting so well?

67
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,830
You only count yours.

68
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,370
I heard that you used Qian Qian's name

69
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,150
to buy a set of new equipment for our rescue team. Is that right?

70
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,340
You could say that.

71
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,530
Money

72
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,700
should be spent on this kind

73
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,870
of meaningful and worthwhile places.

74
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,960
It shouldn't be spent on those things don't create any value for life.

75
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,770
Fine, fine, fine. Quit talking useless stuff. Okay?

76
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,230
I'll drink this us, and you can quit talking uselessly.

77
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,540
Aren't you going to stop me?

78
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,790
Go get more beer!

79
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,100
My pants are getting wet.

80
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,390
- Be careful of the rocks. <br> - Yeah.

81
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,380
Be careful.

82
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,670
Is that right?

83
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,270
Go.

84
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,880
How old do you this rock is?

85
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,590
That rock?

86
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,320
Probably several million years?

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,260
- Several million years? <br> - Yeah.

88
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,940
That's awesome.

89
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,710
After several million years

90
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,260
of wind and sun, it hasn't changed at all.

91
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,160
How is that possible?

92
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,580
Being blown by the wind and baked by the sun every day,

93
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,160
the rock has to have changes.

94
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,900
Several million years ago, this place

95
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,640
used to be a mountain range. Now it's the sea.

96
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,890
Eventually, some day, these rocks will become

97
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,170
the sands that you see on the ground.

98
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,830
Grain after grain of sands.

99
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,750
No matter how it changes,

100
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,370
I will hold it in my palm.

101
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,280
How long do you plan to live at Hou Jue's?

102
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,950
What about it?

103
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,550
He needs his own space.

104
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,540
I know that.

105
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,170
But I haven't found a suitable house.

106
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,210
I'll move once I've found it.

107
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,280
Live at my place then.

108
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,050
I just rented an apartment.

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,020
Qian Qian.

110
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,600
Why don't you think it over more?

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,270
I'll think it over too.

112
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,400
You should think it over well.

113
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,460
You're many years in age.

114
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,480
A body full of problems.

115
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,720
No house, no car, and even has a son.

116
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,380
Except me, no one else will want you.

117
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm just worried about Hou Jue.

118
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,140
How do you know that Hou Jue will object to it?

119
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,970
When you interfered with his romance, he was so sad.

120
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,610
I did that for his sake.

121
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,020
Respect is the best way to do it for his sake.

122
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,510
Okay, okay. I can't talk better than you.

123
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,170
<i> - Okay. <br> - Hurry up.</i>

124
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,430
Okay, okay, I got it.

125
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,750
♪ <i> The day that the story happened, I came to your side </i> ♪

126
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,680
♪ <i> With each step I walk into your world </i> ♪

127
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,710
It's okay, it's okay. Don't be scared.

128
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Who told you to take my things?

129
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,590
I thought this little monkey is cute, looks a lot like you.

130
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,350
You are still not sleeping?

131
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,840
I can't sleep.

132
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,880
Can't sleep?

133
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,500
If you can't sleep, sit here a while.

134
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,080
Okay.

135
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,280
Drink a sip.

136
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,700
I don't know how to drink.

137
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,810
Who knows how to drink alcohol? But you must see how the alcohol is drank, right?

138
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,250
Slowly enjoy with each sip, it's not bad.

139
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,570
- I'm not sick. <br> - I'll drink, I'll drink.

140
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,880
Taste good.

141
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,700
Boss, are you and Brother Hou Jue considered reconciled?

142
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,300
How many years it has been for both of us?

143
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,900
This small matter is nothing. Don't worry. We're good.

144
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,680
Don't worry. Even if the whole world

145
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,280
is not friends with you. I, Wawa, will be friends with you.

146
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,640
These words need to be said clearly.

147
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,710
You and him are different.

148
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,590
I must be friends you both.

149
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,590
You scared me.

150
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,330
Boss, you were so handsome when you did the rescue today.

151
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,020
You are different from your usual self.

152
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,970
In my heart, you are my big hero.

153
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,020
I'm usually not handsome?

154
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,290
No, no. You are handsome usually too.

155
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,150
But today you are very handsome.

156
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,400
In the future, you will be more and more handsome.

157
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,410
This sounds good!

158
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,250
What's wrong with you today? Usually you'll sleep early and wake up early. Why can't you sleep today?

159
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,150
I don't quite know either.

160
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,280
Actually, last time when I was in the village, I can't sleep too.

161
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,770
Those days I will climb to the roof of my hometown house

162
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,940
to listen to the sounds of insects and people talking from afar.

163
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,160
And even further away, the sounds of big trucks on the road.

164
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,370
In my mind I will think, these people who can't sleep like me,

165
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,400
what are they talking about?

166
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,250
What are they thinking about in their minds?

167
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,630
They are in such a hurry, where are they going?

168
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,530
I thought this world is so big, I want to go and see.

169
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,050
Hai Xing,

170
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,840
Yes?

171
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,620
Nothing much. I just

172
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,270
have not heard you sing for a long time. Can you sing a song for me?

173
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,720
You want to hear me sing?

174
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,760
You need to give me money first.

175
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,320
Then, then, I'll do magic in exchange.

176
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,020
That's okay too. What magic?

177
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,350
I'll make a flower appear for you.

178
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,070
I can't sing for this.

179
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,390

Anyway in the future we'll have more little monkeys.

195
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,130
Hello?

196
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,730
- What's the situation? <br> - The tire lacks air.

197
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,930
There's a warning signal in the car.

198
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,250
<i>I'll take a taxi. help me to call automotive assistance.</i>

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,150
Wait a while. I'll go with you.

200
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,590
It'll be too late. The time is nearing.

201
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,910
What driving is this? You don't want your life?

202
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,200
Don't change lanes.

203
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,390
<i>(Target: Hou Jue)</i>

204
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,910
Driver, you have gone the wrong way. Where are you going?

205
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,690
It's correct. This is the direction that I want to go.

206
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,710
Long time no see.

207
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,170
Liu Tiehao.

208
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,030
You are relentless.

209
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,000
I miss you.

210
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,230
Quick, stop the car.

211
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,990
I'll bring you to a fun place.

212
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,270
I told you to stop the car!

213
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,500
Hello? President Zhao. I have a situation. Quickly call the police.

214
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Follow my signal.

215
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,400
Okay, bye.

216
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,100
Hey.

217
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,000
Hey.

218
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,200
He's really something. He scared me.

219
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,600
Young Master Hou. Take a close look.

220
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,700
Hou Jue is asleep.

221
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,190
He fell asleep on the peaceful beach.

222
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hello? Son. You little brat.

223
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Why did you think to call me?

224
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,200
You're a little brat.

225
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
Is that how you should be speaking to me?

226
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,600
Who are you?

227
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
It doesn't matter who I am.

228
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,100
Did you get the video?

229
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,700
Hello? What exactly do you want?

230
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,800
Don't worry. He's very safe.

231
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,600
I beg you to please not hurt him.

232
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,800
I'll agree to any of your demands, okay?

233
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't demand anything.

234
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Aren't I doing this just for a bit of money?

235
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Why is that so difficult?

236
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,500
Listen up. In five minutes time,

237
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,100
transfer ¥500,000 to the account I sent to you.

238
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,200
No, ¥1 million.

239
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,200
If I don't receive the money in five minutes, I'll have you fish for your son in the sea.

240
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Hello?

241
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,500
Is anyone there?

242
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,000
Is anyone there?

243
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Is anyone there?

244
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,400
Is anyone there?

245
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,200
Hou Jue!

246
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,400
I heard that we are getting a new drill instructor today.

247
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,600
Male or female?

248
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
Are they impressive?

249
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,300
I don't know, but they must be something.

250
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,700
Let me introduce you.

251
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,200
This is today's drill instructor,

252
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,600
Wu Shiyi. She's very good at what she does.

253
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,400
She's one of the top bodyguards in the company.

254
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,900
She's now moving on from being a frontline worker to becoming an instructor.

255
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,700
She wants to pass on her rich combat experience to you.

256
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,200
Today's exercise is designed based on one of her actual experiences.

257
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,600
Shiyi, say a few words.

258
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,100
Yes.

259
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Hello everyone.

260
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,600
Hello, instructor.

261
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,000
First of all, congratulations on getting promoted from being a regular student to a junior bodyguard.

262
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,200
Today's exercise is a test of your overall abilities in the case of emergencies.

263
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Your task is to deliver a document to the president's office

264
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,800
and return to your starting point after getting the president's signature.

265
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Anything can happen while you perform this task.

266
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Your recorder will record the whole process as the evaluation standard.

267
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,400
Do you understand?

268
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,600
Understood.

269
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Today's exercise is strongly supported by Zhirong Construction.

270
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,400
They provided us with the space for this exercise.

271
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,800
We all must strictly abide by the rules and regulations of the property.

272
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Don't damage public property

273
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,800
and don't interfere with the normal operation of the office building.

274
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,400
- Can you do that? <br> - Yes.

275
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,800
- Set out. <br> - Yes.

276
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,400
Are you ready?

277
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,800
Yes.

278
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,000
The test starts now.

279
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,500
- Number 1, get off the bus. <br> - Yes.

280
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Hello, I came to Zhirong Construction to obtain a document.

281
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,600
<i>I'm going out for a meeting. We won't be able to meet up.</i>

<i>Come to my place tonight to celebrate your birthday.</i>

<i>I'm getting another year older. I don't want to celebrate it.</i>

Your dad feels proud, and he insists on traveling.

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,640
- How about it? It's flawless. <br> - Yay!

319
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,300
Didn't I say that I don't celebrate birthdays?

320
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,810
That's before you met me. Now that you've met me,

321
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,110
I won't give you any chance to miss any anniversary dates.

322
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,750
Make a wish.

323
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,070
Okay.

324
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,220
<i>(Wu Shiyi, Happy Birthday)</i>

325
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,970
Got it.

326
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,850
- Sister Shiyi, tell us your wish. <br> - No way!

327
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,720
Older cousin, you must not say it or it won't come true.

328
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,520
No matter the wish, I know I'm in the wish.

329
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,300
Stinky boy, you always have such a great sense of yourself.

330
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
Hurry and do the serious business.

331
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,640
I invited everyone to come today,

332
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,300
there are two reasons. First, it's to celebrate Shiyi's birthday.

333
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,170
Secondly, I want to say a few works to everyone.

334
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,780
This story started from a year ago.

335
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,540
A year ago, that day I didn't check the lunar calendar before I left home.

336
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,700
I was particularly unlucky that day.

337
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,000
As soon as I left home,

338
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,160
I ran into my ex-girlfriend who gave me a wedding invitation.

339
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,780
<i>I opened it, and I wasn't the groom.</i>

340
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,520
<i>I was particularly angry at that time.</i>

341
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,430
<i>I sulked by myself in the car. Suddnly, coming down from the sky,</i>

342
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,400
<i>there came a fantastic heroine who dented my car.</i>

343
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,120
She got off the car and ran away.

344
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,110
I was angry so I went after her to reason with her.

345
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,250
<i>I chased her. I just got to her, she beat me up.</i>

346
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,850
<i>When did I ever beat you up?</i>

347
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,190
<i>At that time, I thought that had to be my most unlucky day in my life.</i>

348
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,400
But, later, that was actually my luckiest day in life.

349
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:04,410
Shiyi, actually, after I met you,

350
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,560
you let me realize I'm especially childish and ridiculous.

351
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,260
But you also let me feel especially courageous and strong.

352
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,880
Actually, you didn't just save my life, but also cured my illness.

353
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,380
So I am grateful for everything that I encountered that day.

354
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,440
In every coincidence, every instant,

355
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,590
If I had missed even one second, I wouldn't have met you.

356
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,800
Shiyi, when you were making a wish, I also made a wish.

357
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,080
Do you know what it is? You don't know.

358
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,620
I will tell you.

359
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,090
I've redeemed this jade pendant.

360
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,380
My mom left it to me.

361
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,170
It's the most important thing in my life.

362
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,260
It's my lucky charm. But, from now on,

363
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,660
I want you to safeguard it for me.

364
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,300
You should safeguard it yourself.

365
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:10,000
Shiyi, I"m willing to exchange everything I have for two good lucks.

366
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,090
One is to meet you, the other is to walk with you forever.

367
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,360
Will you marry me?

368
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,550
<i>Marry him! Marry him!</i>

369
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,470
<i>Marry him! Marry him!</i>

370
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,970
I will.

371
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,840
I knew you will.

372
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,190
Then, you will... I still want to ask you officially.

373
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,400
No matter if we'll be rich or poor,

374
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,710
no matter how handsome and rich I'll become,

375
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,460
you will always love me, not beat me up,

376
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,620
not scold me, and stay with me together until the end?

377
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,340
This kid never speaks

378
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,630
seriously for more than three minutes.

379
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,470
Can you say something nice?

380
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,430
I will officially give it to you to safeguard.

381
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,360
Bride-to-Be, say something.

382
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,120
Actually, a year go,

383
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,460
my life reached the bottom.

384
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,250
I thought I would never meet

385
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,150
the right person.

386
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,740
Because I was almost 30 and didn't have much time or energy

387
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,290
to spend it on a probably wasteful relationship.

388
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,480
But, sometimes I also thought,

389
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,450
if you don't give, how will you receive?

390
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,750
When I was hesitating,

391
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,250
I met Hou Jue.

392
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,030
A guy who was full of problems and needed a good beating.

393
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,880
It made me unable to have time to think of anything else.

394
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,460
I kept thinking how to handle him.

395
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,250
Thank you. You are like a mirror,

396
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,020
using your flaws to light up my strengths,

397
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,180
and made me see my own worth.

398
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,970
You two are

399
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,500
- a perfect match. <br> - Perfect match!

400
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,150
Now I think, as long as there's love, there's hope.

401
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,050
No matter if you are 30, 40, or 60,

402
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,700
as long as you want to pursue happiness,

403
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,860
it's never too late to start anytime.

404
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,930
Thank you all.

405
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,350
I feel very happy now.
