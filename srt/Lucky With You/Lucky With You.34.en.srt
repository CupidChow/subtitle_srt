00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,159
(Episode 34)

4
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
He did so many bad things.

5
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,319
Are you forgiving him just like that?

6
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,799
Zhirong Construction is where it is today...

7
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,840
thanks to his contributions.

8
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,079
But I never knew what he was thinking...

9
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,159
nor did I want to know.

10
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,960
Even you, my son,

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,479
couldn't stand me after only a few months.

12
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
He stayed by my side for over a decade.

13
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,599
If I hadn't done wrong in the past,

14
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,599
he wouldn't have done wrong today.

15
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,680
It happened because of me.

16
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,879
It's my burden to bear.

17
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,120
If I don't forgive him,

18
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,840
the one who shouldn't be forgiven...

19
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,090
is me.

20
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,680
Mr. Hou, should I send you home?

21
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go to the office.

22
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
Go home.

23
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,840
Dad, you must be tired.

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,919
No, I'm going to work.

25
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,879
Hello, Mr. Zhao. It's me, Hou Zhi Rong.

26
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,039
Liu Tie Hao will be discharged soon.

27
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,879
We need to increase the security for Hou Jue...

28
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
as soon as possible.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,039
Okay.

30
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
I suddenly feel like my dad is getting old.

31
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
When he said he had forgiven Ma Yong,

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
I was really surprised.

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,960
He's nothing like the man I knew.

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,159
I feel the same way.

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,360
I used to think that...

36
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,039
he didn't understand me.

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,439
But I realized I don't understand him either.

38
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,400
I don't even know him.

39
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,319
Don't you want to go back and stay by his side?

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,479
He doesn't have anyone he could trust now.

41
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,240
No, I'm not going back.

42
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,159
Now is not the time.

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,439
Once I'm capable...

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,759
and strong,

45
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,639
then I can go back...

46
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,680
and help him out.

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,960
There's no point in going back now.

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
Hello, the number you dialed is turned off.

49
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,920
Is this Zhirong Construction? I'm looking for Ma Yong.

50
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,879
What?

51
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,720
Excuse me.

52
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,160
What did you just say?

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,519
Give me the room key.

54
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,800
Where is yours?

55
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,360
- Hurry up. - What are you doing?

56
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,959
I'm taking something home.

57
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,160
Take...

58
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,560
What are you taking? Where are you going?

60
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,399
Where are you going?

61
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,560
They caught Ma Yong.

62
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,160
What happened before,

63
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,399
including misappropriation of funds...

64
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,839
and proposal theft, was done by him.

65
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,000
He admitted it himself.

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
It's a huge blow to my dad.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,319
He was betrayed by someone he trusted the most.

68
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,120
In my dad's language,

69
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,399
it's worse than having 100 more enemies by his side.

70
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Get back to work.

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,199
I'll pack up and leave.

72
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,839
Monkey.

73
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,399
Enjoy.

74
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,399
Mr. Song.

75
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,879
Hey, buddy. I heard you got out.

76
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,559
Yes, I'm out.

77
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,120
Before I get to visit you,

78
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,879
- you are already out. - It's okay.

79
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,000
It's good. Is everything okay?

80
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,559
Everything is good, Mr. Song.

81
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,399
You're busy,

82
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,679
but you never forget your buddies.

83
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,279
Everything is fine.

84
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,840
I just got out.

85
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,919
All my buddies know that.

86
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,159
They came to me and gave me money.

87
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,039
I can't stop them.

88
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,330
You're well-received.

89
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,399
Buddy.

90
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,330
What about the money you owe me?

91
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,279
Including interest, it's 15,000 yuan now.

92
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,679
Since you are my buddy,

93
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,120
I haven't come to you.

94
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,210
I won't charge you interest.

95
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,720
But as you know,

96
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
I have a lot of men now.

97
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,879
I don't make enough money to feed all of them.

98
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,120
How about this?

99
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,360
I'll give you three days.

100
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,919
If you don't pay up,

101
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,399
my men are on their way to find you.

102
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,720
I can't stop them, can I?

103
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,360
Please don't, Mr. Song.

104
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,799
Your men are so busy.

105
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,960
There's no time for me, right?

106
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,519
Since we are buddies,

107
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
give me one more week.

108
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,919
I'll raise more money.

109
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,519
I'll pay you back with interest.

110
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,799
I can even treat you and your men to a meal.

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,840
All right, three days.

112
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
No, Mr. Song.

113
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,000
You know I'm not good at anything except...

114
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,210
I'm not done yet.

115
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,360
No manners.

116
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,450
Boss, do you have a cigarette?

117
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,759
No, you can get it outside.

118
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,330
But I've done...

119
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,039
quite a number of huge projects.

120
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,679
I've done a lot of research too.

121
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,330
I think designers...

122
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,679
are in a way...

123
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,600
more like artists.

124
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,879
What we design...

125
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,799
- has to... - What a good life you have.

126
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,559
show others...

127
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,440
why we designed it.

128
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,480
It has to portray the personality of the designer.

129
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,960
That's why we have to make it fun.

130
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,639
Include some of your ideas...

131
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,879
- Hello. - and preferences.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,279
Remember what you said today.

133
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,480
Make it hard to tell,

134
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,679
but make others feel...

135
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,960
something different at the same time.

136
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,039
- What are you looking at? - The design industry...

137
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,799
doesn't need the same thing over and over again.

138
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,440
We don't want the same design...

139
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,639
from 100 designers.

140
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,919
That's what we don't want to see.

141
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,480
They would rather buy...

142
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,159
- You haven't paid yet. - or live...

143
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,960
in the high-quality houses that we designed.

144
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,519
- How much is it? - Twenty-five yuan.

145
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,799
I believe, through our design,

146
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,799
the contractors...

147
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,480
- Keep the change. - will have better sales.

148
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,159
I also believe that from now on...

149
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,720
Zhou Quan.

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
Hello, Hou Jue.

151
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Nice to see you again.

152
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,519
You...

153
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,919
From today onwards,

154
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,879
I'll take care of your security.

155
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,000
My dad hired you.

156
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,720
Liu Tie Hao has already finished serving his sentence.

157
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,159
He is out now.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,279
Then how did you know I was here?

159
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,039
I...

160
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,039
Tell me now.

161
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,200
Don't you want to be friends?

162
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,600
Okay. It's no big deal.

163
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
Actually, I've been here all along.

164
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,200
You have been here all along? What do you mean?

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,799
I have been here from the moment you left home.

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
I even followed you to Shenzhen.

167
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
Why did I...

168
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,000
I didn't know.

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
I didn't even notice.

170
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,440
If you had noticed me,

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I might as well quit.

172
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
All right.

173
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
I'll stay here for the next two days.

174
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You know that, right?

175
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
You have to suffer for a while.

176
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,919
Come inside with me. Let's go.

177
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,120
No problem.

178
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,200
You have to change these parts in your report.

179
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,240
Is that so?

180
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,320
- Hello. - You're here.

181
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,039
Superman, print the plan out.

182
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
All right.

183
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,519
- Mr. Bao. - Hello.

184
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,840
Hello, Mr. Bao.

185
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,159
Good news.

186
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,480
Great King Company...

187
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,120
is very interested in our design.

188
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,639
Brush up on your writing.

189
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,639
Then we can print it.

190
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,240
That's great.

191
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,679
This time, I heard your dad...

192
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,120
designed the plan by himself.

193
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,639
Do you know how many years it has been...

194
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,320
since my dad did it himself?

195
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,840
What happened this time?

196
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm not sure.

197
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,559
I only know that Zhirong Construction...

198
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,639
is a mess inside.

199
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,320
The elite troops have left.

200
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,519
Hou Jue.

201
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,399
Please pardon me.

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
If our design...

203
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,879
defeats your dad's,

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,519
would you feel...

205
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,679
We're here every day...

206
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,840
working hard on the design day and night.

207
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,039
We fought and worked hard.

208
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,240
What do you think is my aim?

209
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,840
I've been waiting for this day.

210
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,879
This time, if I don't defeat my dad,

211
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,279
I would...

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,080
You know?

213
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,559
Okay, now I'm relieved.

214
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,759
Carry on.

215
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,559
Mr. Liu.

216
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,879
That jerk quit his dad's company.

217
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,240
Is he still worth anything?

218
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
Of course.

219
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,879
I was merely trying to scare him last time,

220
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,080
his dad was terrified.

221
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,879
He gave me his money.

222
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,799
Mr. Liu.

223
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,960
What is our strategy this time?

224
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,279
You guys hang out with me all the time.

225
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,639
It seems that we hang out for nothing.

226
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,639
That lad designed a book bar.

227
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,679
There is one at the South Bay Hotel.

228
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,279
Tomorrow is the hotel opening.

229
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,120
That lad must be here.

230
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,519
Got it?

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,399
If we go there on the opening day,

232
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,720
the place will be crowded. It won't be easy.

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,879
Are you stupid?

234
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,759
It's easier to do it when the place is crowded.

235
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,240
When it is crowded, people tend to get distracted.

236
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,320
No one will care about us.

237
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,960
Okay, got it.

238
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,399
Eat up.

239
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,279
After this, we'll go for a walk and check out the spot.

240
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,240
What do you mean? Why are you sighing so heavily?

241
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,559
I see.

242
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,480
I take care of things well, okay?

243
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,200
If it is a success,

244
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,679
everyone gets 10 percent.

245
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,600
- Okay? - Okay.

246
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,440
- Isn't this cool? - You're the man!

247
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Eat up.

248
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,240
By the way, how's your dad's foot?

249
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,799
It's getting better.

250
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,200
Thanks for the wheelchair and massage oil.

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,279
No problem.

252
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,639
Should I give you a break?

253
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,679
Go back and see him.

254
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,840
It's okay. We're opening soon.

255
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,519
I still have a lot of work to do.

256
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,919
Don't be nervous. Relax.

257
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
Get some rest.

258
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,320
- Good night. - Good night.

259
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,200
(Grand opening)

260
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,399
- Here you are. - It has been a while.

261
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,399
- You're early. - You look so pretty today.

262
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,679
Welcome.

263
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,319
Come on, keep up!

264
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,240
Is everything ready?

265
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,170
Here they are.

266
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,240
I invited your parents.

267
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,319
The more, the merrier.

268
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,960
Mr. Wu, Ms. Zhang, here you are.

269
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,890
- Congratulations, Lan Qi. - Thank you.

270
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,410
Shi Yi, you look cool.

271
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,359
I've never seen my daughter like this.

272
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,839
She is so manly and cool.

273
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,079
Quick, take a picture.

274
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,720
Mom, I'm working.

275
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,519
See? She is quite serious.

276
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,000
Ying Nan, listen to Shi Yi.

277
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,319
- Let her work. - All right.

278
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,799
- Lan Qi, I... - Wang.

279
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,240
- Take them inside. - Sure.

280
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,839
- Go in first. - We'll go in first.

281
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
See you later.

282
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,519
Mr. Lan.

283
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,519
- Congratulations. - Welcome.

284
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,839
Happy opening. Wishing you the best in your business.

285
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,119
- Thank you. - I'm telling you.

286
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,799
I'll introduce you to someone important today.

287
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,440
It's the real designer of the book bar.

288
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,039
- Is that so? - Hou Jue, come.

289
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
Let me introduce you to each other. This is Mr. Lan.

290
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,759
Hello, Mr. Lan.

291
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,599
Hi, Mr. Hou.

292
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,960
Mr. Lan, as I said,

293
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,559
he is the real designer of the book bar,

294
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,000
- Hou Jue. - It has been a while.

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,039
It has been a while.

296
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,890
I never thought...

297
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,279
you were the one who designed the book bar.

298
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,890
That's right, I never thought...

299
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,119
it would end up here.

300
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,519
Perhaps the design...

301
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,599
portrays its best condition when it is applied here.

302
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,410
We don't know if the design is perfect or not,

303
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,839
but I know it's the best.

304
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,599
Stop. Excuse me.

305
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,079
What are you two talking about? I don't understand.

306
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,279
You'll understand when you grow up.

307
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,920
It's okay.

308
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,519
- We're about to start. Let's go. - Okay, let's go inside.

309
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,559
Let's go.

310
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,200
Come on.

311
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,720
Ladies and gentlemen.

312
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hello.

313
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,319
Today, it's the opening ceremony...

314
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
of the South Bay Hotel.

315
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,319
Is he here yet?

316
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,480
Did he bring a bodyguard?

317
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,680
I don't see that woman.

318
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,119
There are too many people. It won't be easy.

319
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,240
Didn't I tell you? There have to be many people.

320
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,650
There are so many important people.

321
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,650
Who cares about him? Are you stupid?

322
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,410
Isn't there a famous saying?

323
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,839
"The most dangerous place is the safest."

324
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,920
Okay?

325
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
Eat up.

326
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,519
It's such an expensive item.

327
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,839
You can only afford this once in your lifetime, okay?

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,039
In a while,

329
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,519
our process is very simple.

330
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,920
- The seven partners... - He is so handsome.

331
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,119
will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony together.

332
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,759
Then we are having a casual meal together.

333
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
Our hotel is a resort hotel.

334
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,799
So think of this as a vacation.

335
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,240
- He's so cool. - Just relax, eat, and have fun.

336
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,559
- Let's enjoy ourselves. - Stay out of it.

337
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,960
- All right? - Sure.

338
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,960
Next, please welcome our chairman...

339
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,759
to give a speech.

340
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,890
Hello.

341
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,519
Mr. Hou.

342
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,079
You look dashing today.

343
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,960
How did you know?

344
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,890
It's none of your business.

345
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,519
I can see you anyway.

346
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,799
What are you doing?

347
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,200
My dad went on a trip to Europe.

348
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,319
He left me here.

349
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,890
Why do I have to handle this?

350
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,799
I'm bored to death.

351
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,440
That's why I took a seat on the side.

352
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,799
What can I do for you?

353
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,799
What's the matter? Let's meet.

354
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm busy. Let's talk later, okay?

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,920
What is keeping you busy?

356
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Remember Zhang the jerk?

357
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,240
I have the evidence.

358
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,759
I went through so much to get this.

359
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,359
If you want it, you must see me today.

360
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Will you meet me?

361
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,359
Meet me in the hotel room.

362
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,920
Do you want these buns?

363
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,079
Are you going to eat them or not?

364
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,680
- Don't wander off. - You little...

365
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,759
See you, bye.

366
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,920
Can't you do anything right?

367
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,170
Why did you come? Are you here for a bun?

368
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,720
I'm very grateful.

369
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,480
For those who attended the opening of our hotel...

370
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,519
despite their busy schedule,

371
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,480
ladies and gentlemen,

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,799
please accept a warm welcome from me.

373
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,160
Next, let's welcome Mr. Zhang from the city council...

374
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,480
to say a few words.

375
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,279
Welcome.

376
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:07,359
- The door is open. Come in. - Little girl, you're so bold.

377
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,680
I'll do it.

378
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,000
What are you doing?

379
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,160
Chen Chen. Where is she?

380
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,559
Chen Chen.

381
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,319
I'm inside. Come in alone.

382
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,319
Wait outside then.

383
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,519
Come in.

384
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,880
I'm coming.

385
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,039
What is this?

386
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,920
Do I look pretty today?

387
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,400
What's not beautiful about you?

388
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,319
Come here.

389
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,920
Stop it.

390
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,319
Show me the evidence you have.

391
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,599
How boring.

392
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,400
Take a look.

393
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,200
I went through so much to get this.

394
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,920
Hou Jue, I'm sorry.

395
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,160
You're the one who designed the book bar.

396
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,279
It wasn't me.

397
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,720
Don't look around.

398
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,000
The camera might capture your face.

399
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,759
- Cover yourself. - Mr. Liu.

400
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,440
The more you hide, the more obvious it is.

401
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,160
It has captured my face.

402
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,319
- It's taking so long. - It has captured my face.

403
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,359
Why are you in such a hurry?

404
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,880
Why did I bring you two out?

405
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,240
It's here.

406
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
There is a camera in the elevator.

407
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,640
It's not working.

408
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,039
Is this your first time at a high-end hotel?

409
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,799
I paid 300 yuan to the porter to get it done.

410
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,279
You're the best.

411
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
Press it.

412
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,160
I think it is 0920.

413
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,839
- Is it 1020? - It's on the 10th floor.

414
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,559
I'm sure it is 0920.

415
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,079
That's nonsense.

416
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,359
I'm sure it is 1120.

417
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,079
I remember it.

418
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,319
What kind of brain do you have?

419
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
Isn't he handsome?

420
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,920
Yes, he's very handsome.

421
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,440
Send me the link.

422
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
- Let's go. - Let's go.

423
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,000
Look at you.

424
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,799
When you are rich, you can get any girl you want.

425
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Go.

426
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,319
Let's take a look.

427
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,640
Hello, sir.

428
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:29,759
Hello.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,240
Who are you looking for?

430
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,440
I'm looking for a friend.

431
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,039
My friend lives here.

432
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,119
Your friend checked out today.

433
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,279
Checked out?

434
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,359
Yes.

435
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:41,839
I'm here to return things to him.

436
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,720
Well, I have many things to return.

437
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,480
I can't give them back.

438
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,960
I'm sorry. You can call him.

439
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,119
That's right. I should make the call.

440
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,240
- Yes, that's right. - Call him.

441
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
Make a call.

442
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Thank you.

443
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,400
- Okay, I'm done cleaning. - Thank you.

444
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Okay, thank you.

445
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,680
- It's okay. - I'll call him.

446
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,000
All right.

447
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,039
Thank you. Bye.

448
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,079
We are safe.

449
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Which room did you say it was?

450
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,720
It's 0922. Trust me. It's on the 9th floor.

451
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,880
Let's go and take a look.

452
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,759
You're unbelievable.

453
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,079
How did you get this?

454
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,359
I'm almighty.

455
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,480
I can get anything.

456
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,920
Send it to me.

457
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,960
You've been a great help.

458
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,599
We'll talk about it later.

459
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,039
I'm doing you a huge favor.

460
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,720
Shouldn't you make a toast first?

461
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,680
Yes, thank you very much.

462
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,720
Thank you.

463
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,160
Bottoms up.

464
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,079
Under the great expectation from everyone,

465
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,200
on this joyous day,

466
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,240
the South Bay Hotel is finally open for business.

467
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,880
At the moment, this place is full of friends and guests.

468
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
It is an honor to have been invited...

469
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,119
to the grand opening...

470
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,640
The security camera footage shows...

471
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,400
some suspicious people have been spotted at the hotel.

472
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,799
One of them should be Liu Tie Hao.

473
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,240
I'll send you the picture right away.

474
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,319
Keep an eye on Hou Jue.

475
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,079
Okay, don't worry.

476
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,119
Ever since the preparation,

477
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,160
everyone has been working together as a team.

478
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Everyone has contributed tremendously to the hotel.

479
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,160
It has been several times.

480
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,759
I heard our proposal was not bad.

481
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,519
But they still want us to make changes.

482
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,079
Isn't it normal?

483
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,799
Here, this way.

484
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,480
Hold on, let's cut the ribbon.

485
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,799
Everyone, come here.

486
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Hello.

487
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,039
The three people in the picture...

488
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,079
I just saw them.

489
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,279
We've already met.

490
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,839
Looking at them, I think...

491
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,839
they wouldn't dare to do anything.

492
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,640
Okay.

493
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,119
I'll keep an eye on them.

494
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,279
You stay alert too.

495
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,759
Don't worry.

496
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,039
Aren't you unruly?

497
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,799
Why are you so useless?

498
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,200
This guy seems like a real fighter.

499
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,759
We'd better stay out of his sight.

500
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,000
Do I need your advice?

501
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,359
- I... - Don't talk back.

502
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm telling you.

503
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,480
We'll let him go this time.

504
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,799
Okay?

505
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,240
Go.

506
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Hello.

507
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,559
They've left the hotel.

508
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,839
It's okay.

509
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,920
Copy that.

510
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,599
Let's talk after the party is over.

511
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,119
You are always so cheerful.

512
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,519
I didn't know you're so reliable in handling matters.

513
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,519
You don't know me at all.

514
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,480
I can't deny that.

515
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,599
I'm sure you're just like most people.

516
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:23,480
You think I'm bossy, capricious,

517
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,279
unreasonable, and arrogant.

518
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,640
That's how you see me.

519
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,839
Don't laugh.

520
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,000
I know that's what you have in mind.

521
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,000
But what I really want to tell you is...

522
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,079
that's just a way...

523
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,680
to protect myself.

524
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,000
It's not necessarily the real me.

525
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:48,599
Today, I decided to sit down...

526
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,599
and tell you about this...

527
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,759
in a serious manner because...

528
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,480
It's because...

529
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,160
I want to ask if you could give me a chance...

530
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,799
I mean, give us a chance...

531
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,440
to know each other better.

532
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,200
When you suddenly act like this,

533
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,839
I'm not used to it.

534
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,119
Chen Chen.

535
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,240
Recently,

536
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:30,160
I confessed to a woman...

537
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,279
in front of so many people.

538
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,400
I told her I really like her.

539
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,160
And deep down, I love her too.

540
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,759
And I still haven't heard back from her.

541
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,960
Until now,

542
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,279
I'm still holding on.

543
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,119
I'm still holding on.

544
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,160
I will persevere.

545
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,200
It's that woman, right?

546
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,200
I lost to her, again.

547
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,400
Let me ask you something.

548
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,720
What if, in the end,

549
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,240
she still won't agree to it?

550
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,440
Will you continue to fight?

551
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,680
Or would you choose someone else?

552
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
I'll hang in there.

553
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,960
Then I...

554
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,279
I wish you happiness.

555
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,920
We're buddies from now on.

556
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,920
Thank you.

557
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,079
Don't even mention it.

558
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,480
I got rejected for the first time in my life.

559
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,680
It's tough.

560
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,160
Give me a friendly hug.

561
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,960
Forget about the hug.

562
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm wearing a white suit after all.

563
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,279
What white suit?

564
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,039
That's just an excuse!

565
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,119
Why can't you be nicer to me?

566
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,599
What's going on?

567
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,240
What are you doing?

568
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,599
Here.

569
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
I'm deeply regretting what I did.

570
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,759
I'll take any punishment.

571
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,079
Serves you right.

572
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,720
How shameless.

573
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,480
Things went so well for the opening party,

574
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
all thanks to you.

575
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Don't say that.

576
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,769
Thanks to everyone.

577
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,329
Can we be more friendly to each other?

578
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,199
I'm friendly to you.

579
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,679
I'm happy...

580
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,289
that I got to work with you.

581
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,119
What about you?

582
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,199
I'm happy too.

583
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,159
Actually,

584
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,519
I was waiting for the right time...

585
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,360
and trying to look for a special way.

586
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:53,809
But then I thought...

587
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,599
when exactly is the right time.

588
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,920
You know, when it comes to the right person,

589
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,639
the present is the best time.

590
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
Marry me.

591
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,639
Lan Qi.

592
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,360
This is too sudden.

593
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,559
You are not surprised.

594
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,119
Yes, it's too sudden.

595
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,360
I know you care about me.

596
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,119
You care about my parents too.

597
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,239
But...

598
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,329
I can't go on like this.

599
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,400
I must admit that at first,

600
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,329
I hired you as my bodyguard...

601
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,639
not because I wanted you to protect me.

602
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,440
Neither that nor offering you...

603
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,400
a well-paying job.

604
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,000
I want us to spend more time together.

605
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,119
I think if I have enough time,

606
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,289
I can make you love me again.

607
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,119
I could really get through to you.

608
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,360
But now,

609
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,559
I can't get in.

610
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,440
Because there's already someone in there, isn't there?

611
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,960
That's right.

612
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,519
I can't lie to you.

613
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,639
I can't lie to myself either.

614
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,000
Does he...

615
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,329
Does he treat you better than I do?

616
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,119
You are nice.

617
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,960
You are the perfect candidate for a husband.

618
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,809
It doesn't matter who you end up with,

619
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,880
you always make sure to keep your lives in order.

620
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:58,159
But love isn't a competition.

621
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,440
It's not a competition about who fits who better...

622
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,440
or who treats who better.

623
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,920
What are you doing?

624
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,440
Get rid of the evidence. It's embarrassing.

625
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,679
Pretend this never happened.

626
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:29,079
He didn't win and I didn't lose.

627
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,079
Do you feel much better?

628
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,809
Thank you.

629
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,639
All right.

630
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,159
That's the end of personal stuff.

631
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,599
Please don't tell anyone.

632
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,079
Show some respect to your boss.

633
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,000
As for work,

634
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,480
do you want to leave or stay?

635
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,289
It's your call.

636
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,000
No matter what,

637
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,769
we'll be friends forever.

638
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,159
It's a big deal.

639
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,559
Why didn't you tell us?

640
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,159
Even if I did, the ending would still be the same.

641
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,639
How is he not a good fit?

642
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,239
What's wrong with Lan Qi?

643
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,199
He is great,

644
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,039
but I don't have feelings for him.

645
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:53,480
No one would have feelings for another person all of a sudden.

646
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,960
Even married couples have to adjust to each other.

647
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,159
Look at me and your mom.

648
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,199
Don't remind me.

649
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,480
We were happy, right?

650
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,840
You have to admit that.

651
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,559
There are more bad days. You should admit it too.

652
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,880
Okay, back at me, you two.

653
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,289
Lan Qi and I didn't break up...

654
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,039
because we never started.

655
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,119
Shi Yi, tell me the truth.

656
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:23,599
Is it because of Hou Jue?

657
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,809
Hou Jue?

658
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,559
Him again?

659
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,000
Whatever you say.

660
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,559
But Hou Jue is very different from him.

661
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,920
At least he's real.

662
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,519
He never hides his pros and cons.

663
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,159
At least it's easier...

664
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,679
dealing with people like him.

665
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,920
Have you ever thought...

666
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,440
you might never be able to meet someone better than Lan Qi?

667
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,519
That's right.

668
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,599
That's what you think.

669
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,679
I just want to find someone I like.

670
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,159
You used to like Zhu Da Peng.

671
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,559
Yes, that's right.

672
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,880
But it's because you liked him.

673
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,639
You thought I should get married at this age.

674
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,199
You thought he was a good catch.

675
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,199
We somehow ended up together.

676
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,289
I didn't figure out...

677
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:04,559
what was wrong with me that time.

678
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,719
Are you sure you know what are you doing now?

679
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,880
Yes, I know it well.

680
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,519
Whether I marry or not or regardless of whom I marry,

681
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,920
I want to choose what I like...

682
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,079
on my own.

683
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,400
It's my life.

684
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,159
Shi Yi.

685
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,329
You'll be 30 years old soon.

686
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,159
I don't think you can get married.

687
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,559
When no one wants you anymore,

688
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,639
the three of us don't have to live separately.

689
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:38,440
You're both living with me.

690
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,639
Let's live together.

691
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:40,809
You are so kind.

692
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,360
Thank you. I've been alone for over a decade.

693
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,440
I'm so used to it.

694
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,360
That's a forced habit.

695
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,480
As the expert said,

696
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,039
one doesn't know what to eat when they live alone.

697
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,639
That's the dilemma of the century.

698
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,039
It's much better when two people live together.

699
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,599
The expert's surname is Wu, right?

700
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,960
Don't doubt it.

701
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,119
Don't flatter yourself.

702
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,199
Shi Yi.

703
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Your dad and I think...

704
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,239
you will be happy if you marry Lan Qi.

705
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,480
Your mom is right.

706
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,559
But happiness is up to you.

707
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,840
Stay single if you want.

708
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,039
It's no big deal.

709
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,599
Why did you change your mind?

710
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,840
I thought it would be hard to explain.

711
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,000
It makes sense right away.

712
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,639
Mom, you are so wise.

713
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,809
Here, have some shrimp.

714
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:24,920
Okay.

715
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,960
Shi Yi.

716
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,119
Have some vegetables too.

717
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,239
- Eat some vegetables and meat. - I'm telling you.

718
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,639
I don't want to come back...

719
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,239
to this restaurant again.

720
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,329
It reminds me of the hard feelings.

721
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,599
I think I need to order more food for you.

722
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,480
Excuse me.

723
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,679
We would like to order more.

724
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,559
Eat up.

725
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,559
Hello, what would you like to order?
