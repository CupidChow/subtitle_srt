19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Why did my father suddenly fell sick?

20
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,340
Lie here for a bit, okay?

21
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,840
The emergency's doctor said that the person who called 120 was Zhu Dapeng.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,040
I checked on the location for the emergency call, and it was Zhu Dapeng's home.

23
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,620
Why did my dad go there?

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,810
No idea. Maybe he was so upset that he went to reason with him?

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,170
Dad's really something.

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,350
The company has paid for the medical bill.

27
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,420
It will be deducted from you wages.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,360
<i>Shiyi.</i>

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,030
- Dad, are you okay? <br> - He is...

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,380
I am Hou Jue.

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,410
I am Shiyi's client.

32
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,880
Sit, sit, sit.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,400
Okay.

34
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,450
Shiyi, how could you let the client come pick me up?

35
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,930
I'm so embarrassed.

36
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,800
Uncle, we are the ones who should be sorry.

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,320
Shiyi could have come sooner, but was delayed because I was busy with something.

38
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,470
Sorry.

39
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,850
It's okay. Work is important.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,980
Qian Qian, as Shiyi's client,

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,540
I will thank you for Shiyi. Thank you for watching over her dad for her.

42
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,460
The company has a rule.

43
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,490
When a teammember is on duty outside, no matter what problems are happening at home,

44
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,280
the mission must be completed smoothly.

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,290
The company will go to the teammember's home to provide immediate support.

46
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,250
Shiyi, I have to lecture you. From now on,

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,870
treat me as your colleage, a brother.

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,680
If there is any trouble, just say it.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,250
When something like this happens in the future, let's finish what's important first, an then we can go back to fighting. Right?

50
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,550
Fighting? What fighting?

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,690
It's nothing. They are talking about fighting in games.

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,360
You must have turned it around.

53
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,750
You should treat Shiyi as your brother.

54
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,640
Can you coordinate with us better?

55
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,950
Shiyi is my brother. Right?

56
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,010
Rest a while.

57
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,050
Shiyi, are you all right?

58
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,490
I'm fine.

59
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,090
Dad, look at you. You are the one who has a surgery. I'm not.

60
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,230
Oh yes, don't tell your mom about this.

61
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,070
If she comes, I wouldn't die peacefully.

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,940
Is that so?

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,550
What? You know that Shiyi's parents are divorced?

64
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,130
Yes.

65
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,800
Shiyi's father owes a huge debt because he was cheated in investing.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,900
She has been working endlessly these years to pay back her father's debt.

67
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,560
She exhausted all her savings, sold the car,

68
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,690
lives in the company dorm, never overspent even one penny.

69
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,090
She is so frugal that she is particularly harsh to herself.

70
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,850
Truly, there aren't many women like her these days.

71
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,100
Mr. Hou,

72
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,630
this job is very, very important to Shiyi.

73
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,970
Can you not make it difficult for her from now on?

74
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,880
It's really hard for her now.

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,840
I-I am not making it difficult for her.

76
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,970
Shiyi has a strong will.

77
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,090
She doesn't like to tell her friends about her difficulties.

78
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,840
I'm telling you all this because I trust you.

79
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,050
But, don't misunderstand. I'm not begging you for Shiyi.

80
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,400
I only hope that she won't lose this job because of willfulness.

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,410
Our company has a rule.

82
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,770
No matter what reason, if a teamember is returned, it will be documented in the file.

83
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,410
It will be hard to return to duty.

84
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,260
If this happens, I don't know

85
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,410
how Shiyi's father's debt will be repaid.

86
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,210
You saw it too. Shiyi is very filial.

87
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,060
This matter is like a rock that's pressing in her heart.

88
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,380
How much does her father owe?

89
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,940
Sorry, I can't say too much about private matters.

90
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,380
Okay. Got it.

91
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,020
Thanks.

92
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,790
Shiyi, I'm leaving first. I still have things to do in the company.

93
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,670
Take good care of uncle.

94
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,490
Uncle, take a good rest. I'll visit you another day.

95
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,730
Thank you.

96
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,080
- Uncle, bye. <br> - Bye.

97
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,170
I'll walk her out then.

98
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,580
Young man, do you see my cellphone?

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,190
I put it away in the drawer.

100
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Okay.

101
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,010
- Sorry to bother you. <br> - No need to say that.

102
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,960
- I'm leaving now. <br> - Bye.

103
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,590
I'm sorry that you are staying with me here.

104
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,160
The doctor will come in a while to check. If everything is okay, we'll be able to leave.

105
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm not leaving.

106
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm not leaving today.

107
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,840
Your dad just had a surgery. Someone should stay with him at night.

108
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,110
I'll rent two visitor beds from the nurse in a while to stay with you here.

109
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,950
It's also mealtime. They'll be sending meals over soon.

110
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,940
You... are staying with me to stay with my dad here?

111
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,870
That's right. How else then?

112
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,790
You have to protect me.

113
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,690
Are you sure?

114
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,010
It's fine. Tell your friends to leave. I'll stay with you here.

115
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,950
- Sorry to inconvenience you then. <br> - Hurry and go.

116
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,150
Xiao Chen.

117
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,810
Coming. Uncle, I'm going out for a bit.

118
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,340
Okay.

119
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,550
You can go back now. I'll stay here with my dad.

120
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,210
Okay. If you need anything, just call.

121
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,700
Okay.

122
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,650
<i>Meals are here. Come get the food.</i>

123
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,770
Food is here. Food is here. Hurry up. I've started all day. Quick.

124
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,980
- Let's eat. <br> - Is this steamed bun?

125
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,820
Here. What do you want to eat?

126
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,790
Meat balls then.

127
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,320
- This, this. <br> - Don't touch.

128
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,420
I want spare ribs.

129
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,270
Add chili pepers to the potatoes.

130
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,750
Li Chu, it's me, Old Wu.

131
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,550
I went to talk with that Dapeng.

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
I need to clear up something with you.

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,090
My Shiyi isn't the one with the problem.

134
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,480
Dapeng is the one that went for someone new.

135
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,220
He is a b*stard.

136
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,460
I saw that woman.

137
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,190
She admitted it herself.

138
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,500
I told Dapeng to call you to explain.

139
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,250
He wouldn't agree. He wouldn't say it.

140
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,090
I have to tell you.

141
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,470
This involves Shiyi's reputation.

142
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,410
Dapeng totally failed on this matter.

143
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,550
Is he talking about that bare-bottomed guy?

144
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,100
Okay, okay, I'll hang up then.

145
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,340
Shiyi.

146
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,990
I got your food.

147
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,780
I told them to leave. I'll stay with you today.

148
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
- This... <br> - Yes, Uncle.

149
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,590
We both will stay with you here.

150
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,770
This is improper. You are busy at work. Mr. Hou is also busy.

151
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm not busy, Uncle.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,970
You just rest easy and recuperate. The two of us will stay here with you.

153
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,660
I'll just think of this as experiencing life.

154
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,840
What is there to experience in life?

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,220
Here, let's eat.

156
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,310
Have a bun.

157
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,290
He just had a surgery and can't eat greasy food. You eat first.

158
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,320
He can't eat so much? You eat.

159
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm not hungry. You eat, or it'll get cold soon.

160
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll eat then. I'll eat.

161
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,000
Dad, are you thirsty?

162
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,660
How are you? Are you okay?

163
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,720
It's important. Why are you still smiling?

164
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,290
I-I'm really worried about you.

165
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,650
If I cry, can't that solve the problem?

166
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,700
<i>I really shouldn't have believed in what Liu Tie Hao said.</i>

167
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,410
People like him will do anything for money.

168
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,360
I told you long ago to let go.

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,520
Later I gave him another ¥50,000.

170
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,200
I told him to stop but he wouldn't listen to me. I don't have any solution.

171
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,320
Of course I don't want him to hurt Hou Jue.

172
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,480
Then... Then...

173
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,700
Will he sell you out?

174
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,300
Think about it.

175
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,050
If he does that, who good is it for him?

176
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,650
I am his money god, right?

177
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,670
I told the lawyer to ask around.

178
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,480
He will be convicted to imprisonment for at least 3 months to half a year.

179
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,420
When he gets out of prison, he will need money.

180
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,670
He will definitely come to me.

181
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,740
This is too scary.

182
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,540
What if-What if this kind of people cling to you,

183
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,480
there won't be any end to it.

184
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,410
How about we leave this place then?

185
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,280
We can't leave so simply.

186
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,900
We should make good use of these three months.

187
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,340
What else do you plan to do?

188
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,180
Xiao Min, for the rest of your life,

189
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,020
do you want to live free of worries with me?

190
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,270
Do you want to travel around the world together?

191
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,530
You guys...

192
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,580
Please go home. No need to stay here with me, you are so busy.

193
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,870
It's a request from the doctor.

194
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,050
That's right. Don't kick us out.

195
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,640
I haven't slept on this kind of bed before.

196
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,690
This kid, what so good about this cot?

197
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,690
I can take this as an experience to live as a group.

198
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,280
Thank you.

199
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,230
You're welcome.

200
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Thanks.

201
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,620
Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

202
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,270
That's enough.

203
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,430
Who wins will go brush their teeth first.

204
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,610
- You won. <br> - Great!

205
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,100
Dear daughter,

206
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,270
how old is Young Director Hou?

207
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,200
- 26. <br> - How much he behaves like a kid?

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,920
You said it right.

209
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,020
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

210
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,380
<i>What's the matter?</i>

211
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,330
<i>I got into fight with the thug.</i>

212
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,980
<i>You tried to protect me and you can't even take care of your dad when he is sick.</i>

213
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,230
<i>I have never feel myself being so unreliable. </i>

214
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,170
<i> It's not too late to realize that. </i>

215
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,590
<i> Your scumbag ex has been spreading false rumors about you, and making your dad sick. </i>

216
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,510
<i> Do you want a revenge?</i>

217
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,860
<i> I want.</i>

218
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,430
<i> That's great. We can still be friends.</i>

219
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,620
<i>I thought you are going to use your upright tone and tell me you've already forgiven him. </i>

220
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,050
<i> If it's not because of this incidence, I have already forgotten about him.</i>

221
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,560
<i> I'm quite jealous with relationship between you and your father.</i>

222
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,560
<i> Pay the debt behalf of your Dad. You are the modern day Mulan.</i>

223
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,870
<i>- Who told you that?<br>- I won't tell you.</i>

224
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,390
<i> I've been paying the debt with lots of resentment.</i>

225
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,070
<i> When I see my dad, it makes me so mad.</i>

226
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,910
<i> Don't compliment me. I will feel embarrass to lose my temper in the future.</i>

227
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,430
<i> Then you shouldn't lose your temper. You are doing great.</i>

228
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,390
<i> What happened between you and President Hou?</i>

229
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,440
<i> I felt like you two don't really get along?</i>

230
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,760
<i> It's nothing. He treated my mom badly.</i>

231
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,220
<i> Can you tell me more?</i>

232
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,060
<i> After all my mental struggle, </i>

233
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,700
<i>I promised you that I will try...try my best</i>

234
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,910
<i> not to agitate you. </i>

235
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,640
<i> I've already take the screenshot,</i>

236
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,560
<i> for future court evidence.</i>

237
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,220
<i> Ha!Ha!</i>

238
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,710
<i> Goodnight.</i>

239
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,430
<i> Goodnight.</i>

240
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,970
Hello?

241
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,120
What's the matter?

242
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,840
What?

243
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,200
- President Hou.<br> - what's the situation?

244
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,420
According to the Corporate Financial Management Regulations,

245
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,650
the encryption key that account are held by the accountant,

246
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,610
cashier and I.

247
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,430
We have already checked, all keys are intact.

248
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,750
Also, finance department's door and our drawer locks

249
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,990
didn't get damaged.

250
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,670
We have checked CCTV,

251
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,440
no suspicious personnel went into the finance department after 11pm.

252
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,700
What did the police say?

253
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,230
They came here right away.

254
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,650
They came and took some ID and left.

255
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,860
They suspected that someone with computer virus to hack into our system.

256
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,700
and stole the encryption key password and execute the transaction.

257
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,070
Can we check where the money went?

258
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,730
The recipient account locates at Solomon Islands.

259
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,700
There is no mutual legal assistance agreements between two countries.

260
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,360
Also, there are a lot of global money laundering associations

261
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,980
will help people from our country to open accounts in Solomon Islands.

262
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,240
Therefore, it is very difficult to track.

263
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,180
If it is difficult to track, then we should find any possible way to track them down.

264
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,660
It's ¥20,000,000!

265
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,840
Even if there is a slight chance, we should look into it.

266
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,880
It's almost impossible.

267
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,810
When our computer got hacked last time,

268
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,790
didn't we upgrade the firewall?<br> - That's correct.

269
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,600
We hired a specialized security company

270
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,340
to analysis and examine our computer network for reinforcement.

271
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,700
But the hacker this time is too good.

272
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,680
Then you guys has to think of a way! Thank of a way!

273
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,190
Ma Yong, stop screaming.

274
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,150
Do you mean if something similar happens again in the future,

275
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,210
we have no way to avoid it?

276
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,450
If we are talking about high-end hackers with specific target,

277
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,310
it's impossible to avoid.

278
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,870
Got it! I understand now. You can leave.

279
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:31,210
Also, we cannot let anybody know about it.

280
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,640
Do you understand?

281
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,230
Got it.

282
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,080
President Hou, ¥20,000,000 in cash got transferred out,

283
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,600
Also, we only left with ¥2,210,000 in the account.

284
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,540
We supposed to received ¥80,000,000 on the third of next month.

285
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,340
However, we need to pay ¥5,800,000 by tomorrow.

286
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,360
How should we handle this?

287
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,580
I will ask the bank for a short term loan for emergency.

288
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,800
Ma Yong, you will handle this.

289
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,910
Got it.

290
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,480
That's it. You can go.

291
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,150
How can we make such a big mistake?

292
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,400
President Hou.

293
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,800
Don't be so angry. We will do anything to track it down and undergo investigation.

294
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,490
What we need to do now is to

295
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,400
suspense those few people in the finance department.

296
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,190
If we suspend them, how are we going to operate?

297
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,670
If this is really a hacker's job,

298
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,970
the suspension will mean nothing.

299
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,710
I will open another account at the bank, if this happens again,

300
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,260
that means this hacker

301
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,030
must be an inside job.

302
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,020
That's right. I agree to what you said.

303
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,800
I have confront numerous rivals in my lifetime,

304
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,740
but somebody with such a skillful and untraceable tactics,

305
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,410
this is my first time.

306
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,030
I think this hacker's target is not Hou Jeu but me.

307
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,200
The funniest thing is up until now,

308
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,410
I can't even figure out who could be the suspect.

309
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,630
- Sister Hong, show me this month's financial report to me in a while. <br> - Okay.

310
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,910
Hong, check this company.

311
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,890
❤️

312
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,750

313
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,260
Nurse, hello.

314
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,990
- May I ask, which room is Wu Tian Yi staying in? <br> - Wu Tian Yi?

315
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,120
Yes.

316
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,390
Uncle, you really should watch your body here.

317
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,970
Slowly.

318
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,460
Slowly.

319
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,600
What's up with you? What's going on?

320
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,550
From the sound of the heels, I could tell you're coming.

321
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,760
Sister, sit. I'll get a pot of hot water for you, uncle.

322
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,220
- Thanks. <br> - Okay.

323
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,440
How did you become a sister?

324
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,180
Quite a good kid, but his gaze missed something.

325
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,370
What's wrong? It proves that I'm young.

326
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,930
You are the old uncle whose gaze is missing something.

327
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,990
- Who's treating you? <br> - Young Hou. He's quite nice.

328
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,910
Did Shiyi tell you I'm in the hospital?

329
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,460
How else, heard it through TV news?

330
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,680
I'm fine.

331
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,560
All these years, didn't I get through by myself whenever I was sick?

332
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,060
- Don't worry. <br> - Don't think so affectionately of yourself.

333
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,510
I'm here to find happiness built upon your suffering.

334
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,040
You are how old? Why didn't you think about

335
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,590
what if something happened to you, you'd drag Shiyi down again?

336
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,090
- Look at you. <br> - Okay, okay.

337
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,690
You get happy, and go back to your stuff. Shiyi has arranged everything.

338
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,910
There's even a nurse aide.

339
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,480
Why did you do this?

340
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,320
I went to see that Dapeng.

341
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,680
Guess what happened? He had another woman at home.

342
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,990
That woman readily admitted that Dapeng had an affair.

343
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,520
How daring! That scumbag.

344
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,960
Big scumbag. I got so angry.

345
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,330
When I woke up, I was lying here.

346
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,820
That Zhu Dapeng!

347
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,090
What are you doing? Sending him a WeChat?

348
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,450
What WeChat. I blocked him long ago.

349
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,800
I heard that he is participating in the Top 10 Most Popular Writers.

350
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,200
He is number 10 now with over 200 votes than number 11.

351
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,970
I think the vvoting stops at noon today.

352
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,460
- What do you want to do? <br> - What do I want to do?

353
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,320
I want to eradicate this pest for China's writing profession.

354
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,730
I totally agree.

355
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,040
chu~ chu~ chu~~

356
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,460
cha~ chachaa~~

357
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,790
- Hello, Teacher Zhang. <br> - You are all here.

358
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,910
Teacher Zhang, you rushed to gather us here. What's the matter?

359
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,260
Everyone gets a bag. Come.

360
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,630
Teacher, how much crying will it take to finish using these?

361
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,590
You are not the ones to cry today.

362
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,130
Come, I'll tell you more.

363
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,760
- Aunties, hello. <br> - Hello.

364
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,830
Little friends, hello.

365
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,820
Auntie, here is a pack of Zhufei tissue for you.

366
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,360
- Here, little friend, you have one too. <br> - Big sisters, do you have some time?

367
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,480
- No, no. <br> - Big sister. <br> - Aunties.

368
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,930
Sorry to disturb you. I have a friend competing in the Top 10 Popular Online Writers right now.

369
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,060
- Do you mind voting for me? <br> - Okay. <br> - Okay.

370
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,480
You can scan this QR Code and vote for Number 63.

371
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,690
- This is the Zhufei tissue for you. <br> - Okay, thanks.

372
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,050
- Okay, one at a time. <br> - Thanks for the support. Please support Number 63.

373
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,260
Thanks. Thanks.

374
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,100
Did you write all night? Worked hard?

375
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,960
Hmm.

376
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,890
The weather is so nice today.

377
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,850
How far did you write to? Let me see.

378
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,450
Isn't this where you were last night?

379
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,600
What do I tell the editor?

380
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,020
I wanted to write faster, but I couldn't without any ideas.

381
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,850
Hey, looking for excuses?

382
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,530
Have you called that website?

383
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,490
No.

384
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,170
Why not?

385
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,410
You were clearly tricked by that Number 63.

386
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,450
You must call and file a complaint. Those votes shouldn't count.

387
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,860
I know that Number 63 writer.

388
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,750
He's famous as an honest homebody.

389
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,730
If I say he tricked me, I would be scolded harshly.

390
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,880
Being scolded is temporary, but the official recognition lasts forever.

391
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,670
Besides, clearly he tricked you.

392
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,500
Why can't you complain?

393
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,660
Maybe...

394
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,360
Maybe his fans got together and voted.

395
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,570
The main thing is, I don't want to provoke any trouble.

396
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,330
You suffered but you don't want to provoke trouble?

397
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,340
Everything I want to have a serious talk, you'd fall asleep.

398
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,740
I don't know what I liked about you originally.

399
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,600
Xuemei.

400
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,120
Are you happy being with me?

401
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,160
Being happy is the only thing left.

402
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,820
Let me ask you then.

403
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,990
What if...

404
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,260
What if, later on,

405
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,660
I don't have much accomplishment and don't make much money,

406
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,840
and always disappoint you, what will we do then?

407
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,240
What else? I'll support you then.

408
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,480
Really?

409
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,790
Why do you have so much useless talk today? Don't disrupt my thoughts.

410
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,200
Why is the second male lead just a jerk?

411
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,890
He doesn't know to appreciate a good woman. Write him off.

412
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,460
What do you want to eat? I'll cook it for you.

413
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,930
Quiet

414
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,610
Go make breakfast. I'm hungry.

415
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,770
I've checked back and forth on Director Tian's account.

416
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,950
The account looks very clear, no problem at all.

417
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,690
Tian Min is actually a really good finance person.

418
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,000
Clear headead, very reliable.

419
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,830
I still remember her resume when hiring her.

420
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,790
She wa the local champion in the national college entrance exam, and twice won the math olympiad.

421
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,760
Her major was in computers in college.

422
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,300
And she specialized in computer software development.

423
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,450
People in that field usually have a high IQ.

424
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,070
I hope the investigation's result

425
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,560
won't have anything to do with her.

426
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,530
How about it? Have you decided?

427
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,290
This one should taste good, right?

428
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,670
That's a hanging dragong. It's the one.

429
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,560
- Are you sure? <br> - Yes, I'm sure. Hurry.

430
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,220
I'll weigh it.

431
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,460
- One catty two taels. <br> - Okay.

432
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,490
- I'll take it. <br> - Sure? <br> - Yes.

433
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,870
What's with you today? Spending a lot?

434
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,090
YOu usually can't bear to spend so much money.

435
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,210
You don't understand.

436
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,270
- I won't give you the change then. <br> - No problem. We know each other.

437
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,750
- Go safely. <br> - The best meat? <br> - It's the best meat, I guarantee.

438
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,660
How is it?

439
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,600
It's ready to come out.

440
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,110
- Get a bigger egg, a bigger one. Wait, Xiao Hei, change the egg. <br> - Okay.

441
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,300
Quick, quick, quick.

442
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,160
- Add a little peppercorn. <br> - Okay. <br> - I'll do it, Brother Tian.

443
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,560
Use some water it won't <br>sting your eyes

444
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,220
Xiao Hei.

445
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,450
Here, I've texted you the address. You must deliver it. <br> - Boss, Boss.

446
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,300
Let me do it. So many people are ordering food. Xiao Hei is busy.

447
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,850
- Text me the address. <br> - Do a good delivery.

448
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,810
Slowly. I cooked a long time.

449
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,370
- Okay, just text me the address. <br> - Hurry and go.

450
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,740
- Waiter. <br> - Hello,. Okay.

451
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,260
<i>(Xin Ba Ke)</i>

452
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
- The dishes look good today. <br> - Yeah.

453
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,910
- The tree fungus looks good. <br> - Yes, thanks.

454
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,350
Eat more.

455
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,320
Thanks. Thanks.

456
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,260
Hello. Who's that?

457
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,830
It's me.

458
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,130
Hello, wait a moment.

459
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,650
Okay.

460
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,580
Hello, coach Qian.

461
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,000
Hi, do you want to see me ?

462
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,880
You're Qian Xiaoyan?

463
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,050
That's me.

464
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,330
A coach?

465
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,020
It's from Hai Xing.

466
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,630
Thank you!

467
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,250

It's special and priceless beef for you .

476
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,570
Please don't send it again , <br> I don't deserve it.

477
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,330
You exist, therefore you deserve it.

478
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,570
Trust me , I'll keep working.

479

480
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,840
I...

When did you come back?

482
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,230
Thank you.

483
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,330
What's up?

484
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,870
The cruise line I represent, <br> will enter the domestic market.

485
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:56,120
It'll initiate the first voyage from Shanghai to Seoul.

486
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,730
I hate to refuse you,

487
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,890
but I'm busy with a project.

488
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,680
Look, just enjoy your voyage. <br> I'll go see you when I'm free.

489
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,000
Uncle.

490
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,600
I was kidding.<br> I'm too busy to hang out.

491
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,060
Shiyi Knows my situation so well,

492
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,640
right?

493
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,950
When did you become so fond of work?

494
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,920
Come on. <br>It's been a couple of days.

495
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,290
All right , I'm busy , I need to go .

496
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,990
I've made up my mind. <br> We'll still be here with your dad tonight.

497
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,300
Why?

498
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,810
Did you notice that though your dad

499
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,690
told us to leave this place,

500
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:56,060
he wants us to stay and doesn't <br> want us to leave.

501
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,850
He has been living alone for more <br> than a decade. He's used to it.

502
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,760
But that doesn't mean he likes it , right?

503
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,330
When did you become so thoughtful?

504
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,640
Haven't I always been thoughtful?

505
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,390
Forget it , you have to work.

506
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,210
It's fine , I brought my laptop here.

507
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,160
No more words. I've decided it ,<br> let's stay here.

508
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,040
Could you not keep sitting on the toilet? <br> It seems so weird.

509
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,720
I'll go rent the beds.

510
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,450
I need to rent the beds. Two

511
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,990
okay.

512
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,910
Hou, what does this mean?

513
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,430
You should go home. <br> I'm fine.

514
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,930
We'll stay here with you tonight.

515
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,060
That's not proper. You've got so <br> many works to do.

516
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,920
It's fine. I can work here.

517
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,140
Look at this mess.

518
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,260
Let me help you.

519
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,210
No, you just lie there.

520
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,700
Take good care of yourself.<br> I got this.

521
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,020
Then be careful. All right.

522
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,550
Be careful. Why it can't be lowered?

523
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,520
Open that first.

524
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,760
All right.

525
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,910
Easy.

526
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,740
I brought you lots of trouble.

527
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,910
What? <br> Where are you going?

528
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,860
I need to fetch something from the company.

529
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,630
Now?

530
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,230
Just sleep, <br> I'll go myself. No

531
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,750
Let's go.

532
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,820
It's so late, Why're you still here?

533
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,910
I'm working overtime.

534
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,840
Nobody's here.

535
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,700
Why're you still working?

536
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,310
I'm writing the investigation report

537
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,990
on the missing funds, which president wants.

538
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,670
I'm growing scared.

539
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,520
Why should you be scared?

540
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,650
I'm afraid they'll find it.

541
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:45,550
Listen to me, think about it. <br> Did they find any clues? No.

542
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,620
Any proofs?

543
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,430
Then why should we <br> be sacred? Little fool.

544
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,700
But when will this scary<br> life come to an end?

545
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,350
ZHI RONG

546
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,080
It's my first time to come here at night.

547
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,190
Don't you think the <br>company is a bit creepy.

548
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,970
Since here're no lights at night?

549
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,810
It's safe because nobody's here.

550
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,930
Don't you feel creepy? No.

551
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,610
Isn't it creepy?

552
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:56,100
♫ Light is chasing distant dreams ♫

553
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:02,550
