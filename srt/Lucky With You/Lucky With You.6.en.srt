00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,079
I have my first love

5
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,760
Maybe I have a first love

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
My gosh.

7
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,400
Sir,

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,920
this Boston lobster is the restaurant's specialty.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,959
We have a promotion today.

10
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,719
It's only 499 yuan each.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,599
Would you like to try it?

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
Yes.

13
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,439
Well...

14
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,239
We lived in Boston for quite a bit.

15
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,370
I'll pass for today.

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,370
Okay? I'm tired of eating it.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,879
Just go with what I said...

18
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,090
You're here.

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,719
Thank you.

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,879
Lighting up white candles in broad daylight.

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,560
Who are you commemorating?

22
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,439
To celebrate our beautiful day.

23
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,199
Excuse me.

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
- We... - We're here.

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,439
What...

26
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,599
Let me introduce you.

27
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,810
They are my two good friends.

28
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,319
Xiao Hong and Yuan Yuan.

29
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,960
He's the handsome man who's treating us today.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Hai Xing.

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,039
I don't think he's buying us dinner.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
There are only two sets of utensils.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
No such thing.

35
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Prepare more utensils.

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,599
- Can't you see we have more people? - Yes, sir.

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,639
I'm sorry. Is it Hong Hong?

38
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,120
Xiao Yuan.

39
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm Hai Xing.

40
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,120
Hai as in the ocean.

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,400
Xing as in the stars.

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,439
What would you guys like to eat?

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,919
Have you eaten?

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,960
Who would come to the restaurant after eating?

45
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,520
I just finished my training.

46
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,639
My team was saying they were famished.

47
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,199
Initially, I was going to invite them to come too.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,240
But I didn't want you to spend too much money.

49
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,199
So I only asked my best friends to come over.

50
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,919
Okay.

51
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,960
I already ordered something.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,680
You ladies are welcome to add more.

53
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,080
I was waiting for you to say that.

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
- Excuse me. - Yes?

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,120
What did the man just order?

56
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,080
- Well... - Actually, I think...

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,960
- One Caesar salad. - Yes.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,360
Two spaghetti Bolognese.

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,439
That's it?

60
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,719
That's all? It's not enough.

61
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,000
We'll have a Boston lobster too.

62
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
I want to eat abalone.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,759
You two really know me well.

64
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,080
Those are all my favorites.

65
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,520
Let's add that.

66
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,360
- Add that. - Okay.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,610
Don't you need anything else?

68
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,610
I ate a lot for lunch.

69
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,480
So I won't eat so much for dinner.

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm okay.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,610
I'll just watch you ladies eat.

72
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,279
Goodness me.

73
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,959
The food here is pretty good.

74
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,000
How did you find this place?

75
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,610
I found it online.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,279
I've been wanting to try it.

77
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,399
I was wondering who I could get to pay for the meal.

78
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,759
It just so happens someone offered.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,560
Hai Xing, you're so lucky.

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,170
You should change your name to Lucky Star.

81
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,800
Don't just eat. Let's drink.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,480
- Cheers. - Cheers.

83
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,839
To happiness.

84
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,839
- Yes, to happiness. - Please.

85
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,959
- Thank you. - Thank you.

86
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,079
You're welcome.

87
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,610
It's good.

88
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,879
Try this, Qian Qian.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

90
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm going to get more water.

91
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,730
Eat up.

92
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,170
Here. Aren't these abalones for you?

93
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,480
I like this one.

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,079
Trust me, it's delicious.

95
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,240
- Miss. - It's so good.

96
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,519
Take a picture.

97
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,319
What are you doing?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,319
Can you stop gossiping?

99
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,319
I'll stop.

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,839
Miss, what's our total bill?

101
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,279
Hold on. I'll check.

102
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,319
All right. Thank you.

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,600
There's so much meat.

104
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,839
Hello.

105
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,120
The total is 1,888 yuan.

106
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,000
When can we eat this again?

107
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I don't know.

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
Well...

109
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm in the food business too.

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
We're a family.

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,920
What about a bit of a discount?

112
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Look.

113
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,759
What about 1,500 yuan?

114
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,079
It's okay. That lady already paid for it.

115
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,519
Listen, you two. Eat up.

116
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,240
You won't be able to eat it if you pack it up. Okay?

117
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,279
- No need to pack. - No need.

118
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,000
- We'll eat it here. - We'll finish it here.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,560
It's fine even if I gain 10kg.

120
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Indeed.

121
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
Get me one of those.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,519
- The salmon. - Eat more fruits.

123
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
It's so good.

124
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,199
It's good, right?

125
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,600
It's better than my mom's.

126
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,959
This is embarrassing.

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,160
The man should be the one paying when eating out.

128
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,399
I'll pay next time, okay?

129
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,439
Next time, it's on me.

130
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,959
It's fine. No need to be so polite.

131
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,480
If you're really sincere about it,

132
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,399
I'll call my whole team and you can foot the bill.

133
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,240
Listen, Qian Qian, I think...

134
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,240
it's fine if it's just the two of us.

135
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,360
Do I have to spell it out for you?

136
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,920
No, I get what you mean.

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,800
It's normal that you don't feel the same way about me now.

138
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,319
But I think when it comes to relationships,

139
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,399
as long as one party is interested,

140
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,600
it's halfway to success.

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,800
So you go with logic.

142
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,319
I think "halfway" is putting it lightly.

143
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,000
There's no way you don't have any feelings for me.

144
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Otherwise, why did you pay for me?

145
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,399
Don't you think we are completely different?

146
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,800
So we complement each other.

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
It should be celebrated.

148
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,839
Goodbye.

149
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,920
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

150
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,439
Drive slowly.

151
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Buckle up.

152
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,639
And you ladies...

153
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,759
She's so cool.

154
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,399
Actually,

155
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,240
I didn't want to say it directly.

156
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,800
But I realized that...

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,439
if I didn't tell him directly, he'd never understood.

158
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,519
It's better this way.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That will make him realize...

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
that it won't work out between us.

161
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,720
Are you sure you made that clear?

162
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,279
I made it very clear.

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,480
That's good. No need to make things more awkward.

164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
You're much better than me.

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
Right?

166
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,160
No one has paid for me before.

167
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
What does that tell you?

168
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,879
She paid close to 2,000 yuan.

169
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,600
A girl spent money on a boy.

170
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
What does that tell you? Right?

171
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,480
She even brought her friends.

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,879
If you put it like that,

173
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,839
then it's a success.

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,600
You could certainly say that.

175
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,959
But it's just that I'm still a little reserved.

176
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,079
But I understand.

177
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,759
I've seen those romantic shows.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,330
When the woman is reserved,

179
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,399
the man has to be determined.

180
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,240
Don't worry. This matter...

181
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,679
You can send me your blessings.

182
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
Okay.

183
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,559
Good night. I wish you happiness.

184
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,039
You're such a brag.

185
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,519
Hey.

186
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,210
There's something going on between Hai Xing and Qian Qian.

187
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,360
What?

188
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,159
Hai Xing called me.

189
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,600
He said Qian Qian is interested in him.

190
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,279
I think they can make it.

191
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,279
That's not it.

192
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,399
Tell him.

193
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,720
Hai Xing misunderstood.

194
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm hanging up.

195
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,759
You heard her.

196
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,039
She must be embarrassed.

197
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,279
Hai Xing told me that...

198
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,240
Qian Qian is trying to play hard to get.

199
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,600
Hai Xing sees right through it.

200
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,960
He's totally taking on the challenge.

201
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,799
Maybe Hai Xing got the wrong idea.

202
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,919
Don't worry about him.

203
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,450
As for the Haicheng No. 8 project,

204
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,720
we finally secured it.

205
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
It's going to be a tough road ahead.

206
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,210
Hou Jue,

207
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,639
you will lead the execution plan.

208
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,519
Sure.

209
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,000
I think I should work with Bao Xiao Han.

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,159
The two of us will make a more comprehensive team.

211
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,039
Mr. Hou Junior, thank you for thinking highly of me.

212
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,960
But I don't think I'm able to do it.

213
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,279
Why? Haven't you done it before?

214
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,240
I've only handled small projects.

215
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,600
They're very small ones.

216
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,210
This one is not that big.

217
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,000
But Zhirong Construction has a very high standard.

218
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,559
- I really can't. - All right.

219
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,000
You should be ashamed for not stepping up to the plate.

220
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,360
Since Bao Xiao Han won't take it,

221
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,519
you do it yourself.

222
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,330
Come up with an idea next Monday.

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,360
This is the best opportunity for you to prove yourself to the company.

224
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,330
Meeting adjourned.

225
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,039
I win.

226
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,360
What the heck?

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,559
Why is my luck getting worse?

228
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,519
I can't seem to win.

229
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,210
Why don't we call it a day?

230
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,330
Tie Hao is out of money anyway.

231
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,360
What do you mean?

232
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,840
Are you calling me broke now?

233
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
That's not it.

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,559
You're afraid that I won't pay, right?

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,039
Don't worry.

236
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,679
Your brother has an ATM, okay?

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,039
Where's the ATM?

238
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,919
Where? Do you think I'm going to tell you?

239
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,399
Come now. Tie Hao never owed us money.

240
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,399
Come on.

241
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,360
When are we going to do it?

242
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,000
It's off.

243
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,919
What's happening?

244
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,039
Let me make a call.

245
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,960
My cousin, don't do this.

246
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I'll pay you back. I'm waiting for 50,000 yuan.

247
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,799
He hired a personal bodyguard.

248
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,840
So there's no point in doing anything anymore.

249
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Okay?

250
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,799
The rest of the plan has been canceled.

251
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,480
And who are you calling "cousin"?

252
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,720
Don't try to cozy up to me.

253
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,840
A distant relative is still a relative, my cousin.

254
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,200
Prices are high nowadays.

255
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,279
The 50,000 yuan...

256
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,840
will be used up in no time.

257
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,279
Plus, I'm up in my neck in debt.

258
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,639
Can't you lend me...

259
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,639
the 50,000 yuan first?

260
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,519
What time is it?

261
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,360
Surely it's a little too early to dream.

262
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,840
Fifty thousand yuan for you is a good sum.

263
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,559
The most important thing is to be sensible.

264
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Also,

265
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
don't call me if there's nothing.

266
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,320
Wait...

267
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,639
Are you kidding me?

268
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,559
Hurry and load the truck.

269
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,279
Deliver the goods to Zone A.

270
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,639
Watch it.

271
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,759
And this load...

272
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,159
- Zhang, deliver it to Zone B. - Okay.

273
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,879
Who is it?

274
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,519
Ms. Zhang, I'll get it.

275
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,360
Okay.

276
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
- Hello. Thank you. - Delivery for you.

277
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,600
Mr. Hou Junior.

278
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,159
This is yours, right?

279
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,360
What is it?

280
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
You have a delivery.

281
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,279
Delivery for me?

282
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,519
What is it?

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,320
I don't know.

284
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,799
It's probably the slippers I just bought.

285
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,919
- Ms. Zhang. - Yes.

286
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,679
The new slippers I bought you are here.

287
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,399
Is that so?

288
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,360
I'll open it.

289
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,440
- When did you buy it? - Slippers...

290
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
Slippers that keep you healthy,

291
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,320
slim your legs, and give foot massages.

292
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,000
You're kidding me. Slim my legs? Gosh.

293
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,960
What a good son.

294
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,799
You even bought slippers for me.

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,480
How thoughtful.

296
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Watch your hands.

297
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,879
It's okay.

298
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,000
Let me see.

299
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,159
- My goodness. - Ms. Zhang.

300
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,519
Who...

301
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,919
- Come. - Who did this?

302
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,159
Who put a dead mouse in there? My goodness.

303
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,879
Did I place the wrong order?

304
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,120
Ms. Zhang, it's fine.

305
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
Don't be scared. Sit down.

306
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,960
It's okay.

307
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,519
Who did you offend?

308
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,679
The smell. Quickly, throw it outside. Quick!

309
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,799
Clean yourself, Ms. Zhang.

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,720
Get this out of here. It stinks.

311
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,159
Why is there a photo of you?

312
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,399
What are you taking photos of?

313
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
The address.

314
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,279
So I can check it.

315
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,720
That's gross.

316
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,080
Do you want some water?

317
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,440
- It's okay. - Forget water.

318
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
It stinks.

319
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,559
Hello.

320
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,399
Who are you looking for?

321
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,960
Can you look into the sender of this package?

322
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,559
I couldn't find anything on your website.

323
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,360
This package is fake.

324
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,840
What do you mean by fake? It's not fake.

325
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,120
The slip does have our company's name.

326
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,840
But it's not the right code.

327
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,879
I can't scan it.

328
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,759
You guys probably don't know this.

329
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,279
Nowadays, these fake delivery slips are sold on the Internet.

330
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,639
These people are full of tricks.

331
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,399
They could've used their time to do good instead.

332
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,120
Please take a look.

333
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,639
Is this delivery guy from your company?

334
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,519
Zhu Zi.

335
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,600
Come here.

336
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,679
Is he the one?

337
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,799
You're in charge of this neighborhood.

338
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,080
You delivered this package, right?

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,399
I remember now.

340
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,440
I did deliver the package.

341
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
But when I was scanning the code,

342
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,279
it didn't work.

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,960
The package number didn't match either.

344
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,559
I was confused...

345
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,159
and wondered where it came from.

346
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,279
Could someone have left it in your car without you noticing?

347
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,480
That's what I thought.

348
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Maybe someone is trying to save money...

349
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,879
by not paying the delivery fee.

350
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,000
So I delivered it as a good deed.

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
What's wrong? What happened?

352
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,320
It's okay. Do your thing, Zhu Zi.

353
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm really sorry for causing any inconvenience.

354
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Is there anything I can do to help?

355
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,320
No, thank you.

356
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,759
I'll call you if I need anything.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,039
Come on.

358
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,879
I will get my revenge this time.

359
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,559
That punk.

360
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,559
He really thought I wouldn't dare mess with him.

361
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,159
So he has a bodyguard with him.

362
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,480
I'm not dumb.

363
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,559
A real man knows when to take a step back.

364
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,720
Right?

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,759
Tie Hao, are we letting him scare us?

366
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,759
Do I look like I'm afraid of him?

367
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,080
What are you saying?

368
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,320
Tie Hao is not afraid of anyone.

369
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,759
Tie Hao, give him a black eye.

370
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,440
I'll take a picture and send it to his old man.

371
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,200
Make the old man bleed a little.

372
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,399
Yes, get him.

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,559
I'm not afraid of anyone.

374
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,159
No one.

375
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,200
Get him.

376
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,359
- Get him! - Get him!

377
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,839
- Come. - Tie Hao is the man.

378
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,480
Here it is.

379
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
They have nice clothes. I picked some for you.

380
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,680
I saw some pretty ones the other day.

381
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,759
This one. Look.

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,359
- This one. - I picked it out for you.

383
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,359
- Isn't it pretty? - For me?

384
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,799
Yes, I'm sure it'll look great on you.

385
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,279
I'm good. Thank you.

386
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,240
Look, I chose one for myself too.

387
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,039
- It looks good on you. - Excuse me.

388
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,480
Is this on sale?

389
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,279
It's on sale. It's 60 percent off starting yesterday.

390
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,650
It's 60 percent off. Look.

391
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,839
It was only 50 percent off the other day.

392
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,319
Now it's 60 percent. It's cheaper.

393
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,890
That's nice. It's cheaper, right?

394
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,890
- Yes. - Do I look pretty?

395
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,279
It's so pretty. Ms. Zhang has sharp eyes.

396
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,680
- Am I right? - This is totally your style.

397
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,720
- It's so you. - That's right.

398
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,319
- Put this on. Let me see. - Yes, go put it on.

399
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,759
- Try it on. - Stop it.

400
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,759
- Is it nice? - Yes. I'll take that.

401
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,559
It's okay. It's not heavy.

402
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,319
When I saw it the other day, it was 50 percent off.

403
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,170
Today, it's 60 percent off. Isn't it great?

404
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,319
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

405
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,410
You're welcome.

406
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,839
I knew you'd like it.

407
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,279
You've been photographed.

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Who has been photographed?

409
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,279
- Me? - Where?

410
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,480
You must be mistaken. Why would they photograph me?

411
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,410
I'm not. It's the man who hit your car.

412
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,440
Who?

413
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,890
- No one is here. - Where is he?

414
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,890
That's him.

415
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,559
Don't let him photograph you. Come on.

416
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,319
What's wrong?

417
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,519
It's you again.

418
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,279
- Who are you? This is endless. - What's your deal?

419
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,319
- Who are you? - What's your problem?

420
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,359
What are you doing?

421
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,519
How dare you hit me?

422
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,759
What are you doing?

423
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,890
What the heck, ma'am?

424
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,319
- Who let you take photos? - Ms. Zhang.

425
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,440
Don't touch me. Do you hear me?

426
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,799
Just you touch me again.

427
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,839
- What? - I dare you.

428
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,279
- Let go. - No need to get physical.

429
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:49,359
Are you trying to hit me?

430
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,440
You're ganging up on me, aren't you?

431
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
- Fine. - Are we bullying you?

432
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,119
You accused me of taking photos of you? I'll take it now.

433
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,119
I'll have the public sentiment drown you.

434
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,240
- Stop shooting! - You can't stop me.

435
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,920
I'm warning you. You'd better stop.

436
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,759
It's none of your business. Are you police?

437
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,279
Here, I'm taking photos.

438
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,650
I'll photograph it horizontally and vertically.

439
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,319
Hit me. Hit me in the face.

440
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,519
- Ignore him. - Hit me.

441
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,440
Why did you send those photos?

442
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,680
It's over.

443
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,200
That's it. I told you.

444
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,650
Life is tough and I need money.

445
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,319
I've been helping you all this time.

446
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,960
Now, you should help me.

447
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,279
You don't see me as a brother,

448
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,410
but I regard you as my elder cousin.

449
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Here's what you can do.

450
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,410
Give me Hou Jue's number.

451
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,890
I'll dress that punk up a little.

452
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,279
Make him stand out.

453
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,839
I'll send you the pictures.

454
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,000
Then you can pass them to his old man.

455
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,410
Just leave it to me.

456
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,039
The only thing left is his number.

457
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,519
You know what to do.

458
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,480
What if his dad finds out about our connection?

459
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,650
I wonder if that would be a problem for me...

460
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,200
or for you.

461
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,440
Who was that guy?

462
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
What was he trying to do?

463
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,079
Ignore him.

464
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,650
Punk, one woman is not enough,

465
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,119
so you brought two?

466
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,200
If only I were a few years younger.

467
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
I challenge you to a one-on-one.

468
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,599
I would've beaten him to a pulp.

469
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,200
One-on-one, it is.

470
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,839
Tomorrow at 11am.

471
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,839
The abandoned building on Wangmin Road.

472
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,480
I'll be waiting.

473
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,039
Let's see who the loser is.

474
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,039
(Let's see who the loser is.)

475
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
(Your grandfather)

476
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,650
(Loser!)

477
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,650
Shi Yi.

478
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,799
Mr. Hou said to go to his office when you come into work.

479
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,480
Okay. Thank you.

480
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,079
Go on. Maybe it's about the incident at the mall yesterday.

481
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
Ms. Shi Yi, Mr. Hou is waiting for you.

482
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Wang Xuan.

483
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,839
Please keep an eye on Mr. Hou Junior.

484
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,680
Let me know right away if he leaves.

485
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,279
- Okay, no problem. - Thank you.

486
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The place is nice.

487
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,839
Who's your boss?

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,480
What can I do for you, guys?

489
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,200
- Do you wish to eat or book a stay? - Book a stay.

490
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
All right. Dolly.

491
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,720
Yes. Coming.

492
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,559
Show them upstairs.

493
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,759
Show them the rooms.

494
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,000
- These two men? - That's right.

495
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,759
Sure. Gentlemen, follow me upstairs.

496
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,759
Let's go see the rooms.

497
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,839
You can have lunch here.

498
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,839
All right.

499
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,440
What's up, Young Master Hou?

500
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,079
Hai Xing.

501
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,599
Take your car to the back of the office.

502
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Within five minutes.

503
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,000
What's going on this time?

504
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,359
Cut the nonsense.

505
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,079
Get me an outfit. Something baggy.

506
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
That's it.

507
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Shi Yi.

508
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,279
We received photos from Liu Tie Hao.

509
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,559
What do you think?

510
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,839
Judging from yesterday,

511
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,440
Liu Tie Hao has no immediate plans to harm Hou Jue.

512
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,400
He just wants you to worry,

513
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
so he can extort money from you.

514
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,759
Money-wise,

515
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,039
we can't give him any.

516
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
We shouldn't.

517
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,359
It is my job to protect Hou Jue.

518
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,799
Don't worry.

519
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,119
I've been in more dangerous situations.

520
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,279
Shi Yi, whatever you do,

521
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,720
just get this matter settled.

522
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,200
I understand.

523
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
Mr. Ma.

524
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,759
The text records and call logs you have right now...

525
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,039
aren't enough to make a police report just yet.

526
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
But keep them safe.

527
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,039
Once they can be used as evidence,

528
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,039
we'll make sure he gets what he deserves.

529
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay, don't worry. I will.

530
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,319
Shi Yi.

531
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,119
Thank you.

532
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,920
It's my job.

533
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,359
- Mr. Hou Junior. - Mr. Hou Junior.

534
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,319
Li Chu.

535
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,240
Are you looking for me, Mr. Wu?

536
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
No.

537
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,480
I'm looking for Da Peng.

538
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Nice bike.

539
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,480
Yes.

540
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,960
- What is it? Tell me. - Li Chu.

541
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,599
You see...

542
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,519
Well...

543
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,519
What is it? Tell me.

544
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,119
I'll be honest with you.

545
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,559
I'm hoping to have a proper chat with Da Peng.

546
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,599
Ying Nan heard a lot of rumors about Shi Yi...

547
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,759
from other people.

548
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,359
Even if they broke up for real,

549
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,559
it's not right for Da Peng to bad-mouth Shi Yi.

550
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,000
Don't you agree?

551
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,480
Yes.

552
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,079
Just end it on a good note.

553
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,039
Young people make mistakes too.

554
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,039
That's right.

555
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,119
Listen, Mr. Wu.

556
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,319
If I see Da Peng,

557
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,799
I'll let him know.

558
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,000
- Okay. See you later. - See you later.

559
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,240
Ride safely.

560
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,480
All right.

561
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,519
Your turn.

562
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,839
All for one.

563
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,799
One for the books.

564
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,160
One...

565
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,440
One-hit wonder.

566
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,200
One in a million.

567
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,839
The joke is on you. One-trick pony.

568
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,519
One...

569
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,960
One-trick horse.

570
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,000
You lose.

571
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,279
Go and wash the dishes.

572
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,759
Fine.

573
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,799
Coming. I'll get the door.

574
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
Who are you looking for?

575
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
You are...

576
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,799
Da Peng.

577
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:40,839
Da Peng.

578
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,039
Mr. Wu.

579
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,039
Are you guys eating?

580
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,960
- I'll come back another day. - It's fine.

581
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,119
It's Shi Yi's dad.

582
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Mr. Wu,

583
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,920
since you're already here, come on in.

584
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,000
Yes. Come on in.

585
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,839
Please have a seat, Mr. Wu.

586
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,319
Go. Get him some water.

587
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,519
The water is right there.

588
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,400
Mr. Wu, have some water.

589
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,240
I'm his girlfriend, Xue Mei.

590
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,039
If you have something to say, just say it.

591
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,160
Da Peng and I have been together for a long time.

592
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,559
He doesn't keep anything from me.

593
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,039
A long time?

594
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,759
Mr. Wu, have you eaten?

595
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,359
What are you afraid of?

596
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Mr. Wu.

597
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,599
I know what you're here to say.

598
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,640
I understand how you feel.

599
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,759
But this?

600
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,720
I'd like you to put yourself in our shoes.

601
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,920
Look at the matter from Da Peng and my perspective.

602
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,920
Your daughter probably told you...

603
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,200
that I'm the third wheel.

604
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,440
But I'm telling you now. I'm not.

605
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,920
When I got together with Da Peng,

606
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
they had already broken up.

607
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,160
You had already broken up?

608
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,119
As far as I know,

609
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,039
the real reason they broke up...

610
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,759
is that your daughter is too busy...

611
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,000
to have any time for him.

612
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,359
What he needs the most now is...

613
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,559
someone who appreciates him and keeps him company.

614
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
And I'm that person.

615
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,440
I admire his talent.

616
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,880
It's also because of my recommendation...

617
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,920
that more people started to recognize his work.

618
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:40,799
Mr. Wu,

619
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,359
do you still think...

620
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,799
I'm the third wheel?

621
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Da Peng, is that true?

622
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Say something.

623
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Be quiet.

624
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,480
Da Peng, let me ask you.

625
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,799
Why did you tell everyone...

626
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,200
that Shi Yi was having an affair?

627
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,279
I didn't, Mr. Wu.

628
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,359
I didn't say anything like that.

629
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,359
What about the others?

630
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,160
Li Chu isn't the only one saying that.

631
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,480
Mr. Wu, I swear. It wasn't me.

632
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,519
That's great.

633
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,559
Call them right now.

634
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,720
Tell them he heard it wrong.

635
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,880
You're the one who had an affair and changed.

636
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,279
Is this really necessary?

637
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,319
Yes, it is!

638
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,359
Zhu Da Peng.

639
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I wanted to come and apologize to you.

640
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,680
I hoped you'd be able to let it go.

641
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,279
But who knew?

642
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,759
Not only did you cheat on Shi Yi,

643
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:34,359
but you also said things behind her back.

644
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,079
You're despicable!

645
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,559
You're framing my daughter.

646
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:38,599
I won't allow it.

647
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,680
Mr. Wu, I broke up with Shi Yi.

648
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,039
I don't owe you anything.

649
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,640
You came to my house uninvited,

650
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,039
harassed me to do this and that,

651
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,359
and hollered at my girlfriend.

652
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,559
Is this appropriate?

653
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,839
- Also, - You...

654
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,880
why should I explain anything to them?

655
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,720
Please leave, Mr. Wu.

656
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,400
I trust Da Peng.

657
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,400
You two rogues.

658
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
Wu Tian Yi.

659
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
I addressed you as Mr. Wu out of respect.

660
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,799
You're embarrassing yourself.

661
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,559
You even got yourself on the credit blacklist.

662
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,680
What right do you have to lecture us?

663
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,759
You're ridiculous.

664
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Is he in debt?

665
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,039
I'm not. I don't go back on my word.

666
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,640
I just haven't paid you back.

667
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,680
- I... - That's enough.

668
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,400
A father like you...

669
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,000
can't possibly raise anything good.

670
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,480
I told you to keep your distance from such people.

671
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,720
You...

672
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,839
Mr. Wu, I'm asking you to leave one last time.

673
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
- Just leave. - Or I'll call the police.

674
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,759
Adulterers!

675
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,440
Look at him acting now.

676
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,200
The door is over there, sir.

677
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,279
Can you stop acting?

678
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,119
Wu Tian Yi.

679
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,880
Mr. Wu?

680
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,720
Mr. Wu.

681
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,440
- Mr. Wu. - Mr. Wu.

682
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,279
Hurry! Call 120!

683
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,559

Heaven protects. It will keep you safe.

686
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,160
- Please make way. - Move.

687
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,319
What are you waiting for? Family members can get in.

688
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,920
No. I'm not family.

689
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,319
You're not his family?

690
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,200
But I can give you the contact information of his family.

691
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,240
All right then. Hurry.

693
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Hello?

694
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,000
Are you Wu Tian Yi's family?

695
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,079
Yes, I am.

696
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,799
He had a heart attack. They're saving him right now.

697
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,200
What?

698
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,240
He needs surgery right away.

699
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,359
Please come as soon as possible.

700
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,000
The thing is, I'm busy right now.

701
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,599
I'm not sure when I'll be able to get back.

702
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,279
Doctor, please save my dad first.

703
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,119
I'll call my supervisor.

704
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,160
He'll send someone.

705
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,160
All right. Be quick.

706
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,720
Okay, thank you.

707
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,960
I hope her dad is okay.

708
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,160
Otherwise, we won't be able to explain ourselves.

709
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,440
That's for sure.

710
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,359
You shouldn't have talked back.

711
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,599
I couldn't stop you.

712
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:58,960
You're scolding me?

713
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,119
You're the one to talk.

714
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,920
Didn't you say you two already broke up...

715
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,279
when we got together?

716
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,279
Yes.

717
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:06,039
Then why did you say that about Shi Yi to others?

718
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,359
I did not.

719
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,519
I hope it's nothing serious.

720
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,360
I sure hope so.

721
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,639
It'd be a huge problem if Shi Yi pursued the matter.

722
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,329
I regret yelling at him.

723
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,920
I didn't think he'd collapse so easily.

724
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,039
Is what you said earlier true then?

725
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes.

726
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,329
Then it's fine.

727
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,289
If you hadn't told him the truth,

728
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,039
how else could you have shut him up?

729
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,769
The way I saw it,

730
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,559
he would've fought us until the bitter end.

731
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,809
Loser, your champion is here.

732
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,599
Come on.

733
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,840
- Come down here. - Does it taste good?

734
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,920
Come down.

735
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,679
Come up here.

736
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,079
I've been waiting for you.

737
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,719
Wait there.

738
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,599
You're so bossy.

739
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,360
I'm being nice offering you water.

740
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,159
Come on. Run faster.

741
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:00,289
Loser.

742
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,769
Gosh.

743
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,769
Come on. Run.

744
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,769
Fight me.

745
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,960
Fight me.

746
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,199
Aren't you Mr. Hou Junior?

747
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:32,840
That's you, right?

748
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
You're strong, right?

749
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:35,329
Come on.

750
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,119
Smile for the camera. Here.

751
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:40,159
Come on. Show me what you got.

752
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,809
Now call me Master.

753
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:43,880
Liu Tie Hao is...

754
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,400
Fight me.

755
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,960
Why are you here?

756
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,719
I told you.

757
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,400
I don't hit women. Did you forget?

758
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,639
What do you want?

759
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,289
I dare you to try it.

760
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:37,289
Are you okay?

761
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,599
That's enough. Stop it.

762
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:49,920
Why are the police here?

763
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
I called them.

764
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,329
Hello?

765
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,360
Hello, Qian Qian.

766
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
How's my dad?

767
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,920
Mr. Wu had a heart attack.

768
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,960
He just underwent surgery.

769
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,809
He's out of danger. Don't worry.

770
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:19,000
Mr. Zhao has arranged for a private ward...

771
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,079
and a personal caretaker.

772
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,159
Thank you. I'll be right there.

773
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,920
Okay, bye.

774
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:26,769
Where are we going?

775
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,000
I don't know where is safe to leave you.

776
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So please...

777
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:34,679
come with me to the hospital.

778
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,199
I'm not going to the hospital. I'm fine.

779
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,239
I'm not okay.

780
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,960
My dad had emergency surgery at the hospital.

781
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,599
Your dad?

782
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:46,719
When did your dad go to the hospital?

783
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,119
When I was on my way to find you.

784
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,199
Your dad had an emergency,

785
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,000
but you went looking for me instead?

786
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,079
If I had gone to the hospital first,

787
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,000
I'd be looking for you at the morgue now.

788
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,400
I have to do my job first.

789
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,480
Okay, fine. Just drive.

790
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,769
Mr. Wu, you're awake.

791
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,960
What happened?

792
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,679
You're at the hospital.

793
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,239
You just had minor surgery.

794
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,719
Why am I...

795
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,039
You had a heart attack.

796
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
They installed a stent.

797
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,480
But don't worry. Everything is fine now.

798
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,719
I remember now.

799
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,119
I remember it all.

800
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,199
You are...

801
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,809
I work with Shi Yi.

802
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:47,809
I'm Qian Xiao Yan.

803
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,159
Shi Yi is on her way here.

804
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,159
She'll be here soon.

805
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,119
Dad.

806
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,960
- Shi Yi. - Dad.

807
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,440
How are you?

808
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,360
I'm okay.

809
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:01,920
Where does it hurt?

810
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Don't worry.

811
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,289
The doctor said he can go home after resting for a few days.

812
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,400
Does it hurt?

813
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,769
Why did my dad collapse all of a sudden?

814
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:29,840
Lie down for a while.

815
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,400
The ER doctor said...

816
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,329
the person who called 120 was Zhu Da Peng.

817
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:41,960
I asked where he was picked up.

818
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,559
It was at Zhu Da Peng's house.

819
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,679
Why would my dad go there?
