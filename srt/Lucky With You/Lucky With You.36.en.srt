00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,959
Hou Jue.

5
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,079
Tell me.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,319
At what stage are you in your relationship with Shi Yi?

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,400
Don't even ask.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,719
It was going pretty well before,

9
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,280
but after you kept messing things up,

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,280
it has just become...

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,359
an innocent friendship.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,760
What do you mean I messed things up?

13
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,439
You were the one who was indifferent to it.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,560
Yes, I was indifferent.

15
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,840
But I used to have a house and a car.

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,479
I could take care of myself.

17
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,280
Now, I'm managing a company on the brink of bankruptcy...

18
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,639
and my dad is sick.

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,840
Who on earth has the guts to be with me?

20
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,159
Listen to yourself.

21
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,599
At first,

22
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,530
I didn't think you have a prospect with Shi Yi.

23
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,879
But when I woke up this morning,

24
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,000
Shi Yi was standing next to you.

25
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,120
For some reason,

26
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,960
I feel so reassured.

27
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,280
If things...

28
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,919
are meant to work out between you and Shi Yi,

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,319
I couldn't be happier.

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,159
Then you two can have a child together.

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,400
I will step down...

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,919
and take care of my grandchild every day.

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
What do you think?

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Hou Jue.

35
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,960
Hou Jue.

36
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,400
He's fast asleep.

37
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,360
I heard that your life was at stake.

38
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,240
Yes.

39
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,360
Maybe God wants me to live longer...

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
to pay for my sins.

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,719
I'm surprised.

42
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,759
You, who are always right,

43
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
are talking about atonement.

44
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,280
It's payback time.

45
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,120
I deserve it.

46
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,439
In your heart,

47
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,050
I'm just a passerby.

48
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,240
You don't care about me at all.

49
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,639
Okay, I don't think I'm worth it.

50
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,800
I don't think I'm worth it.

51
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
Don't have lingering feelings for me.

52
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,439
The news that I had fallen sick...

53
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,839
must have spread quickly in the industry.

54
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,319
It has been more than 10 hours,

55
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,120
but I didn't even receive a consoling call or text.

56
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,319
I've been forgotten by this world.

57
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
I've been abandoned.

58
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
You should forget about me too.

59
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,560
If I really forget you,

60
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,600
I won't contact you again.

61
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you know where I am?

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm downstairs.

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
I don't have the courage to go up.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
I don't even know which room you are in.

65
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,040
Thank you for coming.

66
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,800
I finally know...

67
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
the holy sense of taking care of someone.

68
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,199
Of course it's hard.

69
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,800
I finally experience how you felt when you were beside me.

70
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,319
You have experienced so much,

71
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,000
but you didn't even say thank you.

72
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,920
A great favor can't be thanked enough with words.

73
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,839
Miss.

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
There's a patient named Hou Zhi Rong.

75
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,319
Which room is he in?

76
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,839
He's in room 510.

77
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,839
Room 510? Okay, thank you.

78
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
Give it to me.

79
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,680
Wait outside.

80
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,519
He's asleep.

81
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,159
He's putting on quite an act.

82
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,360
Gosh! Were you pretending to be a corpse?

83
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
My goodness.

84
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,039
Are you really sick?

85
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,000
It looks like you're comfortable here.

86
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,450
Why don't you try it?

87
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,279
Switch with me then.

88
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Are you cursing me?

89
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,039
No way.

90
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,360
But you are right.

91
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,759
I didn't get enough sleep last night.

92
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,799
I knew you didn't sleep well.

93
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,450
Really? You're very capable.

94
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,090
Of course. I can read your mind.

95
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,679
Keep going.

96
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,919
Guess why I couldn't sleep well.

97
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,360
Why couldn't you sleep?

98
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,759
I want to hear it from you first. What is it?

99
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
I'm telling you.

100
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,960
It's family matter.

101
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,279
Family matter? No way.

102
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,240
Let me think. What is it?

103
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,720
Someone...

104
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,879
offended his best friend...

105
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,159
because of something.

106
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,919
As a result,

107
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,279
he doesn't find drinking fun anymore.

108
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,639
Nobody talks to him either.

109
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,679
Yes.

110
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,440
But he is too proud...

111
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,440
to apologize to his best friend.

112
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,120
That's why he's upset.

113
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,519
Just when he was clueless,

114
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,679
an unexpected opportunity struck.

115
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,480
When I was predicting it,

116
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
I knew that even if he didn't come today,

117
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,279
he would be here tomorrow.

118
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,679
Isn't that you?

119
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,279
Mr. Sheng.

120
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,559
Stop gloating.

121
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,519
You are so petty.

122
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
That's enough. Look at you.

123
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,720
You're a patient.

124
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,559
I'm here today to see you.

125
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,600
So I won't argue with you.

126
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,399
Fine. Do whatever you want.

127
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,080
I don't need your permission to do whatever I want.

128
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,559
I don't need you to compromise.

129
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,440
Zhi Rong.

130
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,559
We have to talk about this.

131
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,639
I do dote on...

132
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,399
my daughter.

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,879
Those youngsters...

134
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,639
Sometimes, my daughter is indeed at fault.

135
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,279
I also did something that offended you.

136
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,919
At least you know.

137
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,679
Speaking of our children,

138
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,320
you really do have a good son.

139
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,360
Of course.

140
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,519
Can you hand over your son?

141
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,200
That's not a bad idea.

142
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,320
You didn't sleep...

143
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,799
for the whole night.

144
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,159
That's why you are daydreaming so early in the morning.

145
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,399
Dream on.

146
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,440
You have a daughter.

147
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,960
If I hand over my marvelous son to you,

148
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
you'll have both children.

149
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What about me then?

150
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,480
I'll be alone forever.

151
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,960
I think heartless people like you...

152
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,559
should hand your daughter over to me...

153
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,399
so that you'll be alone forever...

154
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,399
to repent and reflect upon yourself.

155
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,519
But a cold-hearted person like you...

156
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,159
will have no one by your side.

157
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,440
Try it if you don't believe me.

158
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,320
Mr. Sheng, are you here to see me...

159
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,399
or make me angry?

160
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,960
You are making me sicker.

161
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Come on.

162
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,919
I'm not welcome anymore, am I?

163
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,600
I'll leave then.

164
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,960
Stand up straight.

165
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,559
Attention.

166
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,759
Take a bow and apologize.

167
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,480
Then I'll let this slide.

168
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,600
A bow is fine.

169
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,440
My deepest condolences to you.

170
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,039
I...

171
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,559
All right.

172
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,759
That's enough.

173
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,879
Three.

174
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,480
Go ahead.

175
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,120
What? What card did you play?

176
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,200
Seven.

177
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,720
K.

178
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,759
K? Here's two.

179
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,080
Two? I can't take the card.

180
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,960
No.

181
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,159
Another two.

182
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,399
- What? - Two.

183
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,720
I can't take it.

184
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,039
No.

185
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
It's my turn.

186
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
- Hello. - Hello.

187
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Is there a patient here named Hou Zhi Rong?

188
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Yes.

189
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,799
Please pass this to him for me.

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
He's over there.

191
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,519
I will tell him to pick it up.

192
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,679
No. Please give this to him for me.

193
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,519
What is this?

194
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,519
It's homemade porridge.

195
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:07,519
What should I tell him?

196
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,720
Just say it's from the little girl...

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
Just say it's some porridge made by the old man.

198
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,960
- Thank you. - Okay.

199
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
A pair of circles.

200
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,080
- A pair of twos. - Double.

201
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,720
Joker bomb!

202
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,600
Mr. Hou, the old man brought you porridge.

203
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,320
Old man? Who is it?

204
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,559
It was that old man.

205
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,600
Which old man?

206
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,159
It was that old man.

207
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,320
All right, you should go.

208
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Which old man?

209
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,720
What old man? Who are you to question me?

210
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,759
It's just a friend of mine.

211
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,240
Shi Yi, get me some porridge.

212
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,639
- All right. - Thank you.

213
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,879
It's over.

214
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,639
You're doomed. You've lost.

215
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,919
Where did this old man come from?

216
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,000
Come here.

217
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,679
Put it on.

218
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,440
- Put it on. - I'll do it myself.

219
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,919
Shuffle the cards, Zhou Quan.

220
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,320
It's done.

221
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,679
Hurry up.

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,080
Here, eat it while it's hot.

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,240
Okay.

224
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,080
It's delicious.

225
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,799
The porridge is really good.

226
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,120
Thank you, little girl.

227
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Old man.

228
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,960
Have some more then.

229
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,200
What are you doing?

230
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,960
Who is it? Who is the old man?

231
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,759
- I'm so worried. - Why do you care?

232
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,279
Let me have my privacy, okay?

233
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,720
Just sit down and play the cards.

234
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,680
What's wrong with you today?

235
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
You got yourself an old man.

236
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,410
You naughty girl.

237
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm coming.

238
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,359
- You're back. - My dad is right behind.

239
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,410
- All right. - I'll go put my stuff down.

240
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,410
- Sure. - Ms. Zhang.

241
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,890
Ms. Zhang.

242
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,170
Mr. Hao, you're finally discharged.

243
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,759
- That's a relief. - Here, change your shoes.

244
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,410
No, you should rest. I'll get it for you.

245
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,000
- They're dirty. - It's okay. Get some rest.

246
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,170
You should rest. Slowly.

247
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,079
Ms. Zhang.

248
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,559
While I was in the hospital,

249
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,599
if I didn't eat the soup you made for me,

250
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,170
I wouldn't have recovered this fast.

251
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,890
- That's right. - Thank you for your hard work.

252
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't mention it.

253
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,119
I've been home alone every day.

254
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,960
I had nothing to do anyway.

255
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,440
Thank you.

256
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,440
Get some rest. I'll cook for you.

257
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Okay.

258
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,650
Hou Jue.

259
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,079
Come here.

260
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,759
Isn't this the painting that your mom got someone to draw...

261
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,170
when you were three years old?

262
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,480
Why do you have this painting?

263
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,890
It has been with me all along.

264
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,119
You just got discharged. Sit down. Don't stand there.

265
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,599
You should rest well after getting discharged.

266
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,680
Stay here and enjoy for another five minutes.

267
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,279
After five minutes,

268
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
you will be officially taken over by me.

269
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,170
What do you mean?

270
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
Will I lose my freedom in five minutes?

271
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,170
Not exactly.

272
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,559
Take a look at this.

273
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,799
It's specially prepared for you.

274
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,519
It's custom-made.

275
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,960
Rehabilitation program.

276
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,170
Get up at 6am sharp.

277
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,200
Followed by 45 minutes walk in the garden.

278
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,650
Breakfast at 7am sharp.

279
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,279
Lunch at 12pm sharp.

280
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,920
Take a nap at 1pm.

281
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Take a walk in the garden at 3pm for an hour.

282
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,759
Dinner at 6pm sharp.

283
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,759
Take a walk at 7pm for 30 minutes.

284
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,200
Go to bed at exactly 9:30pm.

285
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
What do you think?

286
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,759
This isn't a rehabilitation program.

287
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,599
You're keeping me like a prisoner.

288
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,359
It's much nicer than the prison.

289
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I don't see it.

290
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,410
Let me ask you.

291
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,920
Will you let me have some freedom?

292
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,799
You are merely getting revenge.

293
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,279
Listen to me.

294
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,799
You need to get well soon.

295
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,000
When you have recovered,

296
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,000
you can do whatever you want and I won't care.

297
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,839
If you insist that this is revenge,

298
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,319
I'll add two more activities.

299
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,650
That's enough.

300
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,000
Get back to your work.

301
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,650
Ms. Zhang, is the food ready?

302
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,720
Here comes the seasoned tofu.

303
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,599
All right, all the food is here.

304
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,599
What's wrong, Dad?

305
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,119
Is something wrong?

306
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,960
Ms. Zhang, why are there so many vegetarian dishes?

307
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,119
I'm a patient.

308
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,359
I've just recovered from a serious illness.

309
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,170
I just got back.

310
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,799
No matter what, just wait until I've recovered...

311
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,960
before we start...

312
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,079
his so-called health plans.

313
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,519
These are all for your health.

314
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,170
For my health?

315
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,359
The hospital served better food.

316
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,200
At least they served meat...

317
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,799
and fish from time to time.

318
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,000
I've put in a lot of effort.

319
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,319
Don't be ungrateful.

320
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,480
Look at these greenish and yellowish dishes.

321
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,720
This is organic. This is coarse grains.

322
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,170
These are vitamins,

323
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,039
animal protein, and plants.

324
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,799
This is weed. We have everything.

325
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,410
It's a good time for you to recover.

326
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,410
Ms. Zhang.

327
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,839
I need fish for my next meal.

328
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
If there's no fish,

329
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,170
at least make me some braised meat.

330
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,319
You can dream about braised meat.

331
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,079
Your cholesterol level is sky-high.

332
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,410
So you can't eat braised meat.

333
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's just live with these greenish and yellowish dishes.

334
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,079
Son, let's negotiate.

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Fish is fine.

336
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,920
It doesn't affect the body.

337
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,680
It's okay to have fish once in a while, okay?

338
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,599
Fish is stimulating food.

339
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
It's especially bad for your current condition.

340
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,960
Besides, many successful people out there...

341
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,079
just because of a minor flaw...

342
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,000
and teeny, tiny indulge...

343
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,839
I can't let you do that.

344
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,880
Do you think I'm a patient?

345
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,000
Fine.

346
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,119
You all heard it.

347
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,599
That's what he said.

348
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,319
From now on,

349
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,759
I'll eat these.

350
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,519
You have to eat them too.

351
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,759
I'm way ahead of you.

352
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,359
Until you get better,

353
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,880
I will eat what you eat.

354
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
- I'm with you. - I'll eat corn.

355
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,119
- Okay, we'll all eat after you. - Have a sweet potato.

356
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
Okay, I'll take care of myself too.

357
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,240
Yes, we'll all be eating vegetarian food.

358
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
I'd rather go back to the hospital.

359
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,559
By the way,

360
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
while I'm here,

361
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,279
where will Zhou Quan sleep?

362
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,759
In the living room?

363
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,359
He'll go back to his office after this meal.

364
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,279
Yes, he will leave after this.

365
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,759
- I'm going back to the office. - What do you mean?

366
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,240
Why?

367
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,400
Ma Yong was caught.

368
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:10,000
Liu Tie Hao is hiding somewhere.

369
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,960
He can't come out since the police are watching him.

370
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,960
I don't need to be protected anymore.

371
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,119
I'll go to the company with Zhou Quan later...

372
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:18,200
to terminate his contract.

373
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,480
That's all.

374
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,799
Yes, Mr. Hou.

375
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,720
I'm fine with it.

376
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,519
There's a lot to do at the office.

377
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,160
Don't worry.

378
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
What's the point of worrying?

379
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,400
Can't you tell?

380
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm a complete mess at home.

381
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,599
I don't have the power.

382
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,359
Someone else does.

383
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,279
I have to listen to everything he has to say.

384
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,119
Go ahead and eat.

385
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,519
- What's wrong? - What kind of son is this?

386
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,680
- Are you really my own son? - Dad.

387
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Take the supplements.

388
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,839
You have to eat.

389
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,720
He's mad.

390
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,680
Now, I know how my dad felt when I was little.

391
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
That's right.

392
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,640
Mr. Hou Junior, please take a look.

393
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,759
Okay.

394
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,920
Zhou Quan is really good.

395
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,720
We get along quite well.

396
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,720
But I have a personal reason this time.

397
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,240
No problem.

398
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
We respect the client's decision.

399
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,240
How is Shi Yi doing?

400
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,319
Has she been assigned to someone?

401
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,720
Yes, she will receive a big task soon.

402
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,079
How about this?

403
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,240
Why don't I ask her to come to say hi to you?

404
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,799
It's okay. I'm busy.

405
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,319
I'll get going.

406
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,920
All right, Mr. Hou Junior. Take care.

407
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,960
- Thank you. - Bye.

408
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Hello, Mr. Zhao?

409
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,599
Okay, I'll be right there.

410
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,680
Mr. Zhao.

411
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,680
Shi Yi, come in.

412
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,359
An important client asked for you to take the job.

413
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,640
It's on the table. See for yourself.

414
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,680
She's the owner of a cosmetic company.

415
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,759
She is going on a business trip to Europe.

416
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,799
She offers top-notch work conditions and pay standards.

417
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,039
Congratulations.

418
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,759
Mr. Zhao.

419
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm a bit tired these days.

420
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,559
I'm taking a few days off.

421
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,000
I won't accept this job for now.

422
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,519
It's such an important job.

423
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,559
Why aren't you accepting it?

424
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,119
Haven't you been complaining...

425
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

426
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,599
I have some personal matters to take care of.

427
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,519
Okay.

428
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,799
I respect your opinion.

429
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,519
Right.

430
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,960
I'll get you a car assignment note.

431
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,519
Go to Liu of the Fleet Department.

432
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,440
During your break,

433
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,359
you'll need a car.

434
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,119
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

435
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,279
If you need help,

436
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,519
we're always here.

437
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Be safe.

438
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,759
Yes.

439
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,759
You may leave now.

440
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,160
If you want to take a walk, you must come to the beach.

441
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,240
The air is fresh.

442
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,640
There's always traffic jam in the city.

443
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,119
The air is polluted.

444
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,039
The human body is not made to take in polluted air.

445
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,079
If you breathe in polluted air...

446
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,519
Just take a walk around when you have time.

447
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,920
Come out more often. Don't stay at home.

448
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,680
Hey, come back.

449
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,240
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

450
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,000
Look at how people are these days.

451
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,880
- They're so inconsiderate. - That's right.

452
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,839
Listen, you must never...

453
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,200
Let's give him a hand.

454
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,759
Gosh, my terrible back.

455
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,920
All right, it's done.

456
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,279
- Let's go home. - Come on.

457
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,440
Let's go, my son.

458
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,759
You are a role model.

459
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,000
Please come in, Ms. Wu.

460
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,119
This is the house you're renting.

461
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,440
Do you like it?

462
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,839
- It's good. - Here are the two keys.

463
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,920
One for you.

464
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,319
We will keep another one for you.

465
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,559
We can give you both if you need them.

466
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,079
- I'll take them both then. - Okay.

467
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,880
If you need anything else,

468
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,839
- please call the management. - Okay.

469
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,039
Okay. Enjoy your stay.

470
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,200
- Thank you. - Bye.

471
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,599
No matter how much I love you

472
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm coming.

473
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,440
I'm coming.

474
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,279
- You're back. - Stop knocking.

475
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,039
You're a grown-up,

476
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,160
- but you behave like a kid. - Change your shoes.

477
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,799
- All right, stop it. - Go wash your hands and face.

478
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,920
- Let's eat. - I'm going to take a shower.

479
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
Why do you need a shower?

480
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,559
It's almost time to eat. Why are you taking a shower?

481
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,880
Come. Get some rest.

482
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,680
Are you watering the plants, Ms. Zhang?

483
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,119
Are we eating that tonight?

484
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,960
That's not all.

485
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,160
There's tofu too.

486
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Tofu?

487
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,599
I'd rather just have that.

488
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,799
Hello?

489
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,319
How is it going?

490
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,640
Everything is fine.

491
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,839
What about you?

492
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,119
I'm fine too.

493
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,680
I terminated the contract with Zhou Quan.

494
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,440
Is that so?

495
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,480
You have to be careful.

496
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,400
That's right.

497
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,240
I'm not your client anymore.

498
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,200
You're not my bodyguard anymore.

499
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,319
Can't we see each other more often?

500
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,880
Unfortunately, I just signed for a new job.

501
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,960
Who is it?

502
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,160
Is it a man or a woman?

503
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,880
A man.

504
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,559
He is a young boss.

505
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,359
Your company is full of staff.

506
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,880
Why do you have to do it?

507
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,519
I think it's convenient.

508
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,319
I look more like a secretary or an assistant.

509
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,599
It's low-key.

510
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,799
By the way,

511
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,839
in two days,

512
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,000
I'll have to go to a meeting abroad with him.

513
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,319
A meeting?

514
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
No way.

515
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,240
Why not?

516
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,279
Look.

517
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,680
You are going abroad with him alone.

518
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,799
It's dangerous. There is no one to keep you safe.

519
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,880
I'm worried.

520
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,000
It's my job.

521
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,000
I hate it when you say that.

522
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,720
You keep saying that it's your job.

523
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,440
You're so charming when you're working.

524
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,839
What if he likes you?

525
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,839
I would be so worried.

526
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,039
I can't skip my work just because you don't agree.

527
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,400
Okay then. You can get back to work.

528
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
Work hard to make money. Bye.

529
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,039
Yes.

530
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,720
By the way, there's one more thing.

531
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:29,599
Sell my two villas.

532
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,559
Pay back the bank loan with the money.

533
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,799
Use the rest of it...

534
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,000
to settle the mortgage on Hou Jue's condominium.

535
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,359
Okay.

536
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,559
Yes.

537
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,079
Please.

538
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Mr. Hou.

539
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,279
Why are you...

540
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,200
Are you really going to sell the villas?

541
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
Yes.

542
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,519
They're such nice houses. It's a waste to sell them.

543
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,079
It's okay. They're just material possessions.

544
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,599
Ms. Zhang.

545
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,719
When I was in the hospital bed...

546
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:11,769
Do you know...

547
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,920
When I thought I was going to die,

548
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,809
I realized that nothing mattered at that moment.

549
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,360
Be it the cars or the properties.

550
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,239
They are pointless.

551
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,809
They can't help me.

552
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,840
But when I opened my eyes and saw Hou Jue looking at me,

553
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,360
I felt secure.

554
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,880
Yes, that's right.

555
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,519
You...

556
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,679
I could say that you were on the brink of death.

557
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
That's right.

558
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,559
Living alone in that big house...

559
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,079
felt so empty.

560
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,519
I woke up alone.

561
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,480
I ate alone.

562
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,079
After a long day at work,

563
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,329
I went back to my room and slept alone.

564
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,960
It didn't feel like home.

565
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,119
Yes.

566
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I...

567
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,920
I have another idea.

568
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,880
After I sell these two villas,

569
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,079
I will continue staying here.

570
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,039
If I overstay my welcome one day...

571
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,599
and Hou Jue tells me to go back to my own house,

572
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:26,289
I will tell him that I have sold my house.

573
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,119
I will ask him where else he wants me to live.

574
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,440
So I will live here.

575
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,239
He can't kick me out. I'm his dad.

576
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,360
That's a good idea.

577
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,719
All right. I'll get Hou Jue.

578
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,079
All right.

579
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,719
Hou Jue, it's time to eat.

580
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,119
Hou Jue.

581
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,119
Hou Jue.

582
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:15,840
Hou Jue, are you inside?

583
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,559
Where did he go?

584
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,119
That Hou Jue...

585
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,519
Didn't he just come back?

586
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,199
He's not in his room.

587
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,239
He always does everything in a rush.

588
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,329
Yes.

589
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,809
Ms. Zhang, Hou Jue isn't home, right?

590
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:42,559
Make me some braised meat.

591
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,559
I can't do that.

592
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,880
- It's fine to have it occasionally. - No, you can't have any meat.

593
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,960
I'll take good care of you.

594
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,519
Do you know what this is called? "A tiger getting its claws clipped."

595
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,559
That brat.

596
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,159
I'm a nobody now in this family.

597
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,289
You can't say that about him.

598
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,199
I'm telling you.

599
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,559
Your son wants what's best for you.

600
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,000
You don't know, right?

601
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,000
He's very affectionate.

602
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,920
When he wanted to be independent last time,

603
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,480
he didn't take anything...

604
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:15,199
except for the portrait.

605
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,159
Back then,

606
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,079
Yu Jie kept complaining that I was too busy with work...

607
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,199
and I didn't keep her company.

608
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,440
I'm not that busy now.

609
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,880
She died too soon.

610
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,559
She didn't even get to see...

611
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,599
every up and down that I went through.

612
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:56,159
If only...

613
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,519
she had stayed with me until now,

614
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,440
she would have seen how glorious the company was...

615
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:08,289
under my care.

616
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,960
Your mind is only filled with glory.

617
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,400
Have you ever thought...

618
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:16,840
how she got through...

619
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,199
those few years?

620
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
How did she get through it?

621
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,960
Ms. Zhang, don't you know?

622
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,679
I was really busy with work.

623
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,119
I gave her every penny I made at the company.

624
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,920
She could have whatever she wanted.

625
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,239
But when I got home, she would still fight with me.

626
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,039
I didn't even know what I could do to make her satisfied.

627
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,039
Hou Zhi Rong.

628
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,679
I've been working for you for almost 30 years.

629
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,480
I've always called you Mr. Hou.

630
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,920
But today, I'll call you Zhi Rong.

631
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,119
In the past few years,

632
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,519
I've always wanted to tell you something.

633
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,199
Hear me out, okay?

634
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,000
Sure, go ahead.

635
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,920
Yes, all these years,

636
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,769
you've always been busy with work.

637
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:10,039
You've worked so hard.

638
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,519
I understand that.

639
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:14,159
But do you know...

640
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,840
how tiring and exhausting it is...

641
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:20,440
for a woman to take care of a family on her own?

642
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,289
Hou Jue was very weak when he was young.

643
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,239
He had a fever almost every month and had to be hospitalized.

644
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,920
But Yu Jie didn't want to disturb you,

645
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,289
so she never told you these things.

646
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,920
She was waiting for you to come home every day...

647
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,719
so that you could keep her company, talk to her,

648
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,039
and show your concern for her.

649
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,599
But did you ever spend time with her every time you came back?

650
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,769
What do you call this?

651
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:48,559
This...

652
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,199
is cold violence.

653
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,199
Back then,

654
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,639
what she said the most was,

655
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,159
"It's the same whether I have a husband or not."

656
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,920
She cried in front of me several times.

657
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,920
She kept telling me...

658
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,599
that she suspected that you had another woman.

659
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:10,440
You never took her seriously.

660
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,480
You never...

661
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,119
took this family seriously either.

662
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,329
It's true that I had a lot going on at the time.

663
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,809
When I got home, I felt sleepy.

664
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,119
That was why I didn't talk to her.

665
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,519
I would leave the house early the next morning.

666
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
I didn't have an affair.

667
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,119
I didn't have the time for that.

668
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,519
I've never done anything to betray her.

669
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,920
Yes, I know.

670
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
I told her that too.

671
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,289
But what you did...

672
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,519
was indeed suspicious.

673
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,329
And...

674
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,480
do you really know...

675
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,480
your son?

676
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,519
Do you know what he thinks about every day?

677
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,599
Do you know what he does?

678
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,289
Ever since he started to understand things,

679
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,880
what he saw...

680
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,559
was just how tired...

681
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:55,039
and how upset his mom was.

682
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,559
So...

683
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,199
he always believes...

684
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,559
it's your fault that his mom left.

685
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm sorry.

686
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,519
It's all my fault.

687
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:18,769
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

688
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,840
Thank you for telling me this today.

689
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,880
If you hadn't told me,

690
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,289
perhaps one day,

691
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,400
I would probably go to my grave...

692
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,000
without knowing...

693
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,000
how wrong I was.
