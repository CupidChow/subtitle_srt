4
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,680
After finishing the egg,

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,799
I'll be even more energetic.

6
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,359
Slow down. You'll make it.

7
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,439
Mr. Hou.

8
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,719
Can we go now?

9
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm coming.

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,319
Have some more. You haven't had much.

11
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,439
Let's go.

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
- I'm leaving. - Do you have everything?

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,959
Yes, I got it all.

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Hold on.

15
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,439
What?

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,959
Monkey.

17
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,479
Never mind.

18
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,479
- Turn around. - What are you doing?

19
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,919
You didn't even cut off the tag. Don't move.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,759
Don't move or you'll get cut.

21
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,090
It's done.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
I packed you some food.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,240
Eat it on the road when you get hungry.

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,879
Thank you.

25
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,560
I wish you all the best.

26
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,840
- Good luck. - Thank you.

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Bye.

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,199
Thank you for all your hard work, Ms. Qian.

29
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,360
It is indeed hard work.

30
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,199
It's not hard at all.

31
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,400
I'll put your clothes in the car. Hurry up.

32
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Get in.

33
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,199
Thank you.

34
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,960
There's no need to thank me. We're leaving.

35
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,319
Sit in the back seat.

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Monkey.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,240
What's the matter, Shi Yi?

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,719
I don't know. My stomach suddenly hurts.

39
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
I'll get you some brown sugar water. Have a seat.

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,319
- Thank you. - It's okay.

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Qian Qian.

42
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,800
What's the matter with you?

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Who are you mad at? I didn't do anything to you.

44
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,400
Who's the angry one?

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Why would I be mad? You're the one who's mad.

46
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,400
If I am angry,

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,719
does it have anything to do with you?

48
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,730
You...

49
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,610
If you've run into any difficulties,

50
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,800
just tell me.

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
If you're unhappy about something,

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
share it with me.

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,319
Although I can't help you,

54
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,560
I can listen.

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,439
You should just sit quietly in the back.

56
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,680
Just pretend I'm not here.

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I'm not Shi Yi.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
I don't have such a good temper.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,639
If you drive me nuts,

60
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,920
I'll beat you up badly.

61
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,199
Okay.

62
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,759
What a terrible temper.

63
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,439
There's still time.

64
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,120
Let's find a café later.

65
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll organize the data on the computer.

66
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,959
- Computer? - Yes.

67
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,199
Is your computer in here?

68
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,279
Yes.

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,199
Why is it so light?

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Is it in your suitcase?

71
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,879
Where's the computer?

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,800
It seems...

73
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,610
I didn't bring it.

74
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,079
Don't you bring your brain with you when you go out?

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,240
What should we do then?

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Can Shi Yi send it to you via email?

77
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,600
No. The files on my computer are a mess.

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,759
She won't be able to find it.

79
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,199
I'll call Shi Yi now. I'll get her to bring it over.

80
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,199
There should be enough time.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Shi Yi.

82
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,560
This is urgent.

83
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,839
Hou Jue didn't bring his computer.

84
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,959
Please bring it over.

85
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,240
All right. I'll go in and have a look.

86
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,519
Hello?

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I found the computer.

88
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,240
Don't panic.

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Hold on.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,839
I'll bring it to him.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,839
It's okay. I'm fine.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm hanging up. Bye.

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,480
Should we wait for her inside?

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,040
We should wait here. This is urgent.

95
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,800
Let's wait here then.

96
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,399
- Here, take this. - Here.

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Have a look.

98
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,439
- Here. - Okay.

99
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,319
Here's one more.

100
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,360
There's another one inside.

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
- Here. - All right.

102
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,560
Where's the car key?

103
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Here it is.

104
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
There's this box too.

105
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Be careful.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
- Okay, leave it here. - Come on.

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
The door isn't closed yet.

108
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
She's not here yet. Is she stuck in traffic?

109
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,600
Will we make it in time if we change the ticket?

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,079
I've already set a time with the other party. You know that.

111
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,199
They'll think I can't even be on time for the flight.

112
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,560
Why don't I call her?

113
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,879
Don't call her.

114
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:36,879
She's probably more anxious than you are.

115
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,000
Let her focus on driving.

116
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,079
Is she here?

117
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,560
- Give me the computer. - What happened to you?

118
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,959
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

119
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,959
What's wrong?

120
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,079
Are you okay?

121
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,360
Why are you sweating so much?

122
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
I was in a hurry. Hurry and go. You're running out of time.

123
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,160
- Are you okay? - All right, I'll get going now.

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
- Hurry up or you'll be late. - Hurry up. There's no time. Hurry!

125
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
You don't look well.

126
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Are you not feeling well?

127
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,839
Come on, let's go.

128
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm leaving then.

129
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,519
Call me if anything happens.

130
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,450
Which one of you is her guardian?

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
None of us are.

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,960
We're the airport staff.

133
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,799
She collapsed at the airport.

134
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,519
This is the employee ID we found on her.

135
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,159
Call her company at once.

136
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,279
Okay, I got it.

137
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,960
Mr. Hou, I have something to tell you.

138
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
What is it?

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,559
Mr. Sheng has completely cut off our supply.

140
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,120
Completely cut off?

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,759
We've been waiting for the supply of steel from them.

142
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,210
We've even stopped the construction for a few days now.

143
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,879
They said the steel would come today,

144
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,240
but we still have to wait until now.

145
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,679
We still don't know when exactly it will arrive.

146
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
The main problem is...

147
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,279
we can wait for Mr. Sheng,

148
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,840
but our client can't wait for us.

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,639
Every day the project is delayed,

150
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,000
it will cost a large sum of money.

151
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,210
You don't have to tell me that.

152
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,279
Did you ask Mr. Sheng's staff?

153
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,039
They said the steel bars had arrived.

154
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,960
But the supply that was meant for us...

155
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,240
has gone to one of the Ministry of Housing's projects.

156
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,919
What is Mr. Sheng trying to do?

157
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,279
He's angry at Hou Jue and Chen Chen.

158
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,799
Moreover, there's an unwritten rule in their company now.

159
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,090
Xiao Wang.

160
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,720
They are giving the supplies to other companies first.

161
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,799
We're last.

162
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,679
What a petty thing to do.

163
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,360
We had a deal.

164
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,090
Whether the relationship between the kids works out or not,

165
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,090
we won't let it affect our relationship.

166
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,919
How could he go back on his word?

167
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,720
This problem isn't something that can be solved anytime soon.

168
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,120
The construction is what matters the most now.

169
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
I think maybe we should...

170
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,330
change our supplier.

171
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,039
We should have a backup.

172
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,159
It's such an enormous project.

173
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,720
We will need to renegotiate...

174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,480
and reschedule the shipments.

175
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,840
Where will we find that time?

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,519
Tell me. How do we have time for that?

177
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,720
Make an appointment with Mr. Sheng for me.

178
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,759
I need to talk to him in person.

179
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
How old is the patient?

180
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,399
- Forty-five. - Forty-five.

181
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,559
- Any medical history? - No.

182
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,759
- Xiao Li. - Recently, did...

183
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,639
Is patient Wu Shi Yi's guardian here yet?

184
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,759
I'm here!

185
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,679
What took you so long? Hurry up and sign the papers.

186
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,679
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Where do I sign?

188
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,879
Qian Qian.

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,080
Where's Shi Yi?

190
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,279
Why didn't she reply to my message?

191
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,360
Don't mention that name in front of me.

192
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,480
Shi Yi is in surgery.

193
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
It's acute appendicitis.

194
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,799
Is it serious?

195
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,799
She's in surgery.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,320
I'll let you know as soon as we have the results.

197
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,200
Are you home? What's the situation?

198
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
What's going on?

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,120
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

200
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,759
I've asked Zhou Quan.

201
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,080
Shi Yi is in a meeting.

202
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,639
She can't return any calls...

203
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,120
or reply to messages.

204
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Are you two done?

205
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,919
If you bring her up again, I'll flip out.

206
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,200
- No, you... - I told you not to mention her.

207
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,559
Mr. Hou.

208
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,080
Let's cut to the chase.

209
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,039
I still have a flight to catch later.

210
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,159
Is that so?

211
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,240
How could Ma Yong do this?

212
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
If I had known you were so busy,

213
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,440
we could've met another day.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Gosh.

215
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,120
I was the one who set the time.

216
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,559
It's the season for king crabs now.

217
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,799
I'm heading off to Alaska.

218
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,840
Mr. Sheng.

219
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,320
Look at how relaxed and free you are.

220
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,759
I wish I could be as free as you.

221
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,440
Just for some seafood,

222
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,679
you can even leave your business behind.

223
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,039
Let's put it this way.

224
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,039
No matter how big your business gets,

225
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,080
it's all so you can have food on your plate, right?

226
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,120
Yes.

227
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,799
I don't care about anything right now.

228
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,759
I only care about our children's happiness.

229
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,519
Mr. Sheng.

230
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
While...

231
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,840
While caring about our children's happiness,

232
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,240
please also show some concern...

233
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,639
towards our partnership.

234
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,399
When will we be able to get our materials?

235
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,080
We can't afford to delay the construction period.

236
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,759
A day's delay is a day's pay.

237
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,759
There's nothing I can do either.

238
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,320
A few of the materials factories downstream...

239
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,200
have been closed down.

240
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
There was contamination.

241
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,159
Do you know what contamination is?

242
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
I know.

243
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
I'm glad you know.

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,120
I've already sent some people...

245
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,440
to get materials for the orders.

246
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,559
We have to renegotiate the price and arrange the transport.

247
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,480
It all takes time.

248
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
Yes.

249
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,919
However,

250
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,919
don't worry.

251
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,600
Once I have the materials,

252
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,440
I'll give you priority.

253
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,879
Otherwise,

254
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,480
I won't be able to enjoy my king crab...

255
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,840
without feeling guilty.

256
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
Mr. Sheng.

257
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,639
If so,

258
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,519
that's a relief.

259
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,559
If...

260
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
all of this isn't because Hou Jue...

261
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,679
upsets you,

262
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,399
then I'll feel even more assured.

263
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,399
Of course not.

264
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,720
I'm not that petty.

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Yes, you have a big heart.

266
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,600
I mean, you're generous.

267
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,519
You're joking around again.

268
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,240
When is Mr. Zhang going to see us?

269
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,879
Mr. Zhang and Ms. Chen are still talking.

271
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,879
Please wait a moment.

272
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,399
Chen Chen...

273
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
is just a bit hot-tempered.

274
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,639
Her dad had her at an old age,

275
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,399
so he spoiled her too much.

276
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,399
I understand.

277
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,080
Rich families like yours...

278
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,679
all raise their kids like that, right?

279
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,120
Our family is totally different.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,360
My dad doesn't spoil me.

281
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,799
Not only does he not spoil me, but he doesn't care about me at all.

282
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Then...

283
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,919
does he worry about you?

284
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,039
I've never noticed him worrying about me,

285
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,919
but I can tell I annoy him every day.

286
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:43,000
He criticizes me every day.

287
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,000
I suspect...

288
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,960
that after being alone...

289
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,039
for so many years,

290
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,759
he has become twisted.

291
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,600
He can't bear to see me happy.

292
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,679
Whenever I get a girlfriend,

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,279
he says they're after my money.

294
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,000
And then he pressures me.

295
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
He's the same.

296
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,559
He thinks all women are just after his money.

297
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,840
Don't you think that's twisted?

298
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,410
He hasn't looked for another woman all these years.

299
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,319
Is it because...

300
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,650
he still can't forget your mom?

301
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,890
Well,

302
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,599
I have no idea whether he has been looking or not.

303
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,650
But I'm sure he still has feelings for my mom.

304
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,119
I see.

305
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,440
I heard Shi Yi say...

306
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
that you broke up with your boyfriend a few days ago.

307
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,720
You're so nosy.

308
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,759
Does your personality not match?

309
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,680
I want to get married,

310
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,170
but he won't marry me.

311
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,680
Well, then that's...

312
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,799
I'm telling you.

313
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Now,

314
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,519
in our times,

315
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,680
when you're in a relationship,

316
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,039
who would agree to marriage...

317
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,170
after only a few days of dating?

318
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,440
Why should I be tied down by a girl right away...

319
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,279
once I date her?

320
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,119
That's not right.

321
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,759
Yes.

322
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
I mean...

323
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,759
Me. I'm talking about me.

324
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,920
But you're different.

325
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Someone like you...

326
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Look.

327
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,559
Everything about you is great.

328
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,960
You're outstanding in all aspects.

329
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,650
He should be proud...

330
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,799
to date you, right?

331
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,759
But he's no longer interested after you mentioned marriage.

332
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,319
Then he's the one at fault.

333
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,720
He's a jerk.

334
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,480
He's just fooling around with you. How dare he?

335
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
What rights does he have to reject you?

336
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,839
It's so unfair to you.

337
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,359
Show me his face.

338
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
If I ever see him out there,

339
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,359
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

340
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,079
Show me.

341
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,200
Let me see.

342
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
Hello. Mr. Zhang has invited you to the meeting room.

343
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
All right.

344
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,000
I believe in his abilities.

345
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,359
- I'll know once I meet him. - Here he is.

346
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,680
This is Hou Jue, Young Master Hou.

347
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,279
- This is Mr. Zhang. - Hello, Mr. Zhang.

348
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,279
Hello.

349
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,319
- You're quite young. - Yes.

350
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,559
Good.

351
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,039
I like young people.

352
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,839
Young people always have new ideas.

353
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,759
Yes, he couldn't sleep a wink last night because of this.

354
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:18,650
You've had a rough night.

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is...

356
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,759
This is my assistant.

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hello.

358
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,839
- Let's get started then. - Let's go.

359
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,839
Please.

360
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,799
This is the concept proposal of a bookstore bar that I designed.

361
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,480
The main design of the bookstore bar...

362
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,240
is to break free from traditions...

363
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,519
so that it doesn't look like your typical bookstore bar.

364
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,039
We want to put together...

365
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,680
a bunch of interesting elements.

366
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
For example,

367
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,720
we can make some drip coffee...

368
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
and sell some...

369
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,410
Doctor, how is she?

370
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,440
The surgery went very well.

371
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
She still has to stay in bed to rest.

372
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,170
She needs to eat light food for the next few days.

373
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,960
- Don't worry. - Thank you, doctor.

374
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,200
It will be a rare experience for all our senses.

375
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,519
How can we open up our other senses? That is a philosophical question.

376
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,170
The surgery went well. Don't worry.

377
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,000
We have to shut down our sense of sight...

378
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,799
and use our sense of hearing and smell.

379
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,799
I got it.

380
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,680
I'll tell Hou Jue about this.

381
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:38,000
We call this meditation.

382
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,890
And we have to spend most of our time every day...

383
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,890
around 3am to 4am.

384
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,890
That's when it's the quietest.

385
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,839
It's the time when everything is recovering.

386
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,960
That's why we usually choose...

387
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,720
to start working on proposals at around 3am to 4am.

388
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,559
Let's move forward.

389
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,000
Why aren't you answering your phone?

390
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Let me tell you. There's a chance for my project.

391
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,279
Hurry up and call me back.

392
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,319
What's going on with her today?

393
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
She didn't reply to my messages.

394
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,599
She didn't even answer my calls.

395
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
What's going on? She wasn't like this before.

396
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,440
Now that you've finished your proposal presentation,

397
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,039
it's okay to tell you.

398
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,079
Shi Yi is in the hospital.

399
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,319
It was acute appendicitis.

400
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,079
The surgery went well, so don't worry.

401
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,559
You knew she was in the hospital, but you didn't tell me?

402
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,799
You were discussing your project just now.

403
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,079
But she's hospitalized!

404
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,920
You shouldn't have hidden this from me.

405
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,170
Hou Jue!

406
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,480
Congratulations.

407
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Congratulations.

408
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,410
Your proposal has been approved.

409
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,839
Please wait here. I'll get the contract ready.

410
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,319
See you later.

411
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,170
There's no need to thank me.

412
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,170
I thank you.

413
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,410
But please tell Mr. Zhang...

414
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,519
that we'll sign the contract later.

415
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,599
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

416
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,279
Sign the contract later? You're just about to sign it now.

417
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

418
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
What is it?

419
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,400
What are you doing? You're about to sign the contract.

420
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,720
- What is the meaning of this? - Ask him to send it to me.

421
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
Shi Yi is in the hospital. I have to go back and see her.

422
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,559
Shi Yi? What's wrong with her? Is she in critical condition?

423
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,759
Stop talking. I don't have time.

424
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Let go of me. I really have to leave now.

425
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
Thank you so much.

426
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,599
Hou Jue, you...

427
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,599
You're despicable.

428
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,440
You're hopeless!

429
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,079
Can you calm down and stop being so reckless?

430
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,359
Why did Shi Yi endure serious pain to deliver the files to you?

431
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,839
It's because she wants you to succeed.

432
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,240
This is your first project.

433
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,680
You're about to sign the contract.

434
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
It's not appropriate for you to leave now.

435
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,680
It's not a problem. I know what I'm doing.

436
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Compared to Shi Yi being sick, nothing else matters.

437
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,359
Don't you think you'll disappoint her by doing this?

438
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,759
You should sign the contract first.

439
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,279
It's okay. It's not a problem.

440
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,799
None of that matters.

441
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,000
What's important is why the elevator isn't here yet.

442
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,079
Visiting hours are over.

443
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,920
- No, it's okay. - Keep it down.

444
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
What are you guys doing?

445
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,680
Where did I drop it?

446
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,319
It's okay. My friend is inside. I'm going to see her.

447
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,000
No. Visiting hours are over. Come back tomorrow.

448
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,920
I'm already here. Please let me go in.

449
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I can't do that. Those are the rules.

450
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,559
Come back tomorrow.

451
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,799
Do you have a boyfriend?

452
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,000
Why do you ask?

453
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,799
You're out of town for work...

454
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,119
and your boyfriend is suddenly sick in the hospital.

455
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,160
He's all by himself.

456
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,920
You couldn't make it back in time no matter how you rushed.

457
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,039
You managed to catch the last train...

458
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,640
and traveled for more than 30 hours.

459
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,880
When you arrived, it was already midnight.

460
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,319
But you really want to meet him.

461
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,079
What should you do?

462
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,279
Which bed is she in?

463
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,279
No. 24.

464
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,920
It's all the way in, on the left.

465
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,640
- Go on. - Thank you.

466
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,799
Don't disturb others.

467
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:06,839
Don't worry.

468
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
- Go. - Thank you.

469
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,720
It's okay.

470
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,960
Do you need a caregiver?

471
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Wait.

472
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,000
Why are you back so soon?

473
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,720
That was quick.

474
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,960
Caregivers are quite expensive these days, right?

475
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
I don't have much money,

476
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,119
so I came here to do some odd jobs to earn money.

477
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,319
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

478
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,599
I'm fine.

479
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,319
How did your proposal go?

480
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,440
My proposal...

481
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,759
They said...

482
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,680
they need to discuss it.

483
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,759
They'll let me know in a few days.

484
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,119
Then hurry home and get some rest.

485
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,279
It's so late.

486
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,319
I'm not going back. How can I go home when you're here?

487
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,640
It was just a minor surgery.

488
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:15,880
I'll be discharged in a couple of days.

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,519
A minor surgery is still a surgery.

490
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,920
Isn't that right?

491
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,759
Look at the others. Look over there.

492
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,599
They all have caregivers.

493
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
You need one too.

494
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I have to be with you.

495
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,119
I have one too.

496
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,359
It's Hai Xing.

497
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,160
He was going to stay with me, but I shooed him away.

498
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,960
I felt uncomfortable with him here.

499
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,000
That's more the reason I need to stay here. Right?

500
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
Don't worry. I'll stay here.

501
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,119
I'll stay.

502
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,720
What can you do if you stay here?

503
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,960
What if Shi Yi wants to go to the bathroom?

504
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,799
I can't do anything? I can do everything.

505
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,960
If you need to go to the bathroom, I...

506
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,559
I'll get the nurse to take you.

507
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,920
There's really no need for that.

508
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Both of you should go.

509
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:54,359
Even if you don't go, they'll kick you guys out...

510
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,480
when they patrol the rooms later.

511
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
No.

512
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
You really don't need to worry about that.

513
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,079
As long as somebody...

514
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
tells the nurse...

515
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,880
another touching love story,

516
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
we'll get to stay.

517
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,720
What love story?

518
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,279
There's no love story.

519
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,119
Don't worry about it.

520
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,400
I'll stay here with you.

521
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,119
Go to sleep.

522
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
What is the meaning of this?

523
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,960
Wait, are you two female bodyguards...

524
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,519
kicking out a guy who needs to be protected?

525
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,839
That's not appropriate.

526
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,920
If you keep this up, I'll call your company.

527
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,039
Okay.

528
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
You win.

529
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I give in.

530
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,400
Go to sleep.

531
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,240
With you two watching me like this,

532
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,079
how can I sleep?

533
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,079
Why don't you let him lay down?

534
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,279
You get up and protect him.

535
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,160
(Old man)

536
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,079
(I...)

537
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,799
Here.

538
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,720
Wipe your hands and feet.

539
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,359
Here.

540
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,079
Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

541
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,359
Stay still.

542
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,920
You're a patient right now. You have to listen to me.

543
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,960
I can do it. Give it to me.

544
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,319
Can you act like a patient?

545
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,359
This young man clearly does housework all the time.

546
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,880
He's quite skilled.

547
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Yes, at home,

548
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,640
I'm always getting bullied.

549
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,839
I finally get a chance...

550
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,400
to torture her now.

551
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,000
Don't listen to him.

552
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,440
That's not how it usually is at all.

553
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,480
Miss, don't have such high expectations.

554
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,880
This young man really is a nice guy.

555
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,759
When my husband comes to keep me company,

556
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,079
he doesn't know how to do anything.

557
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,720
I get so angry that I could die.

558
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Don't make me laugh. My wound can't handle it.

559
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,720
All right.

560
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,160
I won't talk.

561
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,200
All right, I'll do it myself.

562
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,720
How about this? Hold up my drip bag for me.

563
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,680
I want to go out to brush my teeth.

564
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Do you want to brush your teeth? Okay.

565
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

566
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,640
No, I can't do everything in bed.

567
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Help me down.

568
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,319
Stay here. I'll bring the toothpaste and you can do it here.

569
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,519
Stay in bed. Be good.

570
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,160
It's time to eat.

571
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,319
After eating,

572
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,319
I'm going back to the team.

573
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,319
I have a lot to do.

574
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,119
You take care of your work.

575
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
You're here.

576
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,519
Hou Jue.

577
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,119
If you want to renew your contract,

578
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,279
you should hurry up.

579
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,640
Shi Yi is a celebrity bodyguard now.

580
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,000
There's a long line.

581
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,920
A celebrity bodyguard?

582
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,759
I won't be able to afford it then.

583
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,920
- Pretty much. - It's okay.

584
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
After she's done with her checkup,

585
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
I'll go right away.

586
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,920
No one can take her from me.

587
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,880
I'll fight whoever steals her from me.

588
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Mr. Lan.

589
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,400
You're sure in a rush.

590
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,319
There's still a few days until Shi Yi's contract expires.

591
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,319
Here. Have a seat.

592
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,640
But according to our contract,

593
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,359
under the same conditions,

594
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,240
they have priority in renewing their contract.

595
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,519
That's okay.

596
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,880
I can raise my offer.

597
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,799
I can double the salary.

598
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,559
Also,

599
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,440
Shi Yi can bring along four other teammates.

600
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,799
Here you go.

601
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Mr. Zhao.

602
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,440
Please trust us.

603
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,079
We are in urgent need of talent.

604
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I understand.

605
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,799
But even if they don't renew their contract,

606
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,240
your company isn't the only one who's desperate for talent.

607
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,119
There are a few more companies before you.

608
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,920
Other than an advantage in price,

609
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,880
is there any other special advantage?

610
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,359
In the next two years,

611
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,240
our company will be opening five new hotels in the country.

612
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,160
If our partnership goes smoothly,

613
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm sure our company...

614
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,039
will make your company a strategic partner.

615
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
If that happens,

616
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,799
your company will take care of the security...

617
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,720
in all of our hotels in the country.

618
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,200
I don't know if that's considered an advantage or not.

619
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,599
That's a huge advantage.

620
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,680
Hello, ma'am. Who are you looking for?

621
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,079
I'm looking for Wu Shi Yi.

622
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,400
Ma'am, are you Wu Shi Yi's mom?

623
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,759
That's right. Do you know me?

624
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,160
I saw you the last time you came.

625
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,920
Is Wu Shi Yi here?

626
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,319
She left the company with Mr. Hou Junior.

627
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,319
They left the company?

628
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,279
What do you mean?

629
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,279
It literally means they left the company...

630
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Ma'am.

631
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,319
Did Wu Shi Yi not tell you anything?

632
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,319
She didn't.

633
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,960
Well, I have something to do.

634
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,119
I'll get back to work now.

635
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,599
You...

636
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,319
This kid.

637
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,039
- Hello, Mom. - Shi Yi.

638
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,719
Are you still working as Hou Jue's bodyguard?

639
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
That's right.

640
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,769
Where are you working now?

641
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,000
I need to talk to you.

642
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,840
We're having a meeting outside.

643
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,039
We're not at the company.

644
00:34:32,289 --> 00:34:33,289
What is it?

645
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,639
Bed No. 24.

646
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
It's time to check your temperature.

647
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,199
Why do you need your temperature checked?

648
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,360
Are you in the hospital?

649
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,440
Where exactly are you? Tell me the truth.

650
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:42,769
Don't make me worry.

651
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:50,289
Shi Yi.

652
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,440
Mom, you got here so fast.

653
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,599
Such a serious thing happened.

654
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,440
Why didn't you tell me?

655
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,159
What if there are repercussions if you're not treated properly?

656
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:01,329
It's okay.

657
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,880
I'm an adult. I can take care of myself.

658
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,159
Don't act tough.

659
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,329
There is no such thing as a minor surgery.

660
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,440
The doctor said I can be discharged tomorrow.

661
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,480
I'm all better.

662
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,159
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

663
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,679
Won't I be more worried if I don't know anything?

664
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,079
What happened to Hou Jue?

665
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,639
Why did he get kicked out? And...

666
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,159
And he's even starting his own business?

667
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Him?

668
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,920
His dad is always trying to plan his life.

669
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,329
But he has a mind of his own,

670
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,880
so conflicts are inevitable.

671
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,239
They always argue when they meet.

672
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,559
Anyway,

673
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,960
they both have their own reasons.

674
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,289
As time passed,

675
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
he couldn't stand it anymore.

676
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,519
He wants to be independent.

677
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,599
Did he leave empty-handed?

678
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,559
He's quite stubborn.

679
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,960
He left without taking anything with him.

680
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,000
All he took was a painting of his mom...

681
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,480
and a jade pendant that his mom left behind.

682
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,480
Later on, he pawned the jade pendant...

683
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,960
to pay for his expenses.

684
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,119
He opened a studio...

685
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,400
because he wants to start all over again.

686
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,960
He's usually like a kid,

687
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,960
but he's quite tenacious when he gets serious.

688
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,880
I admire him quite a lot now.

689
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,329
The main problem is that's a huge fall.

690
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:23,199
The beginning is always tough.

691
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,880
What about your work these days?

692
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,239
I'll continue what I'm supposed to do.

693
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,519
Stop acting tough.

694
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,039
I know you too well.

695
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,239
I bet you're doing a lot more than usual.

696
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,809
Ever since you've been with Hou Jue,

697
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,809
one moment you're getting framed,

698
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,559
the next moment, you suffer a cut.

699
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,289
Now, you have appendicitis.

700
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,079
It's really making me anxious.

701
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,880
Mom, don't exaggerate.

702
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
It's scary.

703
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,809
I just suffered a minor injury.

704
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,809
As for appendicitis...

705
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,079
I've had it before. It's not like I just got it.

706
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,000
Why didn't you tell me before?

707
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Yes.

708
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,960
I used to be too busy working.

709
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I couldn't pay much attention to you.

710
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,360
But I love you. You know that, right?

711
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I know.

712
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm telling you.

713
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,159
We absolutely can't make any mistakes...

714
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,559
when it comes to serious matters.

715
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,400
You can't think about being loyal...

716
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,559
to a poor guy who is down on his luck.

717
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,519
You're not a 20-year-old young girl anymore.

718
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:27,000
Your time is more precious than gold.

719
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,920
We can't afford to waste our time on romance.

720
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:31,159
I wouldn't say anything if Lan Qi didn't come back.

721
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,400
But Lan Qi has clearly expressed his feelings to you.

722
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,880
If you continue wasting time on Hou Jue,

723
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,809
what will Lan Qi think?

724
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:40,769
Yes, I know.

725
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:41,960
Hou Jue is not bad either.

726
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,239
But given his current situation,

727
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,079
how old will you be when he pulls through?

728
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,599
And when he does pull through,

729
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,880
what if his feelings change?

730
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,239
It's too big of a variable.

731
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,440
Mom, you're thinking too far.

732
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,039
This is just a job.

733
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,809
My relationship with Hou Jue is just work-related.

734
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,360
That's enough. You've gotten way off track.

735
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,119
Stop talking. He'll be back soon.

736
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,519
So what if he comes back?

737
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,119
I dare say this even if he's here.

738
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:07,769
I'm telling you.

739
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,159
We're not the ones being disloyal. He is.

740
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,960
How could he? He has lost his footing.

741
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,440
And he is dragging you down along with him.

742
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,119
Is this what a man should do?

743
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:16,920
Mom, you...

744
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:21,119
This is so frustrating.

745
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,119
Ms. Zhang, you're here.

746
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,719
Shi Yi, I just ordered lunch and dinner.

747
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,039
Hang in there for one more day.

748
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:30,360
You don't need to eat this tomorrow.

749
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,480
Ms. Zhang, have some water.

750
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,599
I don't want any.

751
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,599
I have to go.

752
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Hou Jue.

753
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,039
Aren't you going to see me out?

754
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes. I'll be right there.

755
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,639
Mom.

756
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,239
Just stay here.

757
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,809
I just want a few words with Hou Jue.

758
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,599
What do you want to say?

759
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,599
Hou Jue.

760
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,289
Let's sit here and talk.

761
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,519
Okay.

762
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,920
First of all, I should thank you.

763
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
You've been taking care of Shi Yi.

764
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,599
I can see she is recovering well.

765
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,239
It's nothing. Shi Yi has always been fit.

766
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,239
I don't need to do much.

767
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:26,960
No matter how fit you are,

768
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,289
after 30, your body starts going downhill.

769
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,639
She's stronger than most people.

770
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,400
She can take down 4 or 5 of me.

771
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,159
Those words don't sit well with me.

772
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,920
Is a girl being better than others at something like that a good thing?

773
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,559
You're right. It's not that good.

774
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,000
I called you here...

775
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,199
to tell you...

776
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,039
that Shi Yi has done more than enough for you.

777
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,719
She almost died a few days ago.

778
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,809
Although she doesn't think that way,

779
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,119
that's how I feel.

780
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,639
Ms. Zhang, I certainly won't forget...

781
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,840
how Shi Yi saved me.

782
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,199
Whether you forget it or not is not important.

783
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,880
Actually, when she got hurt last time,

784
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,079
I wanted to come to find you.

785
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
But then I thought...

786
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,289
she's just accomplishing a mission under a contract.

787
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,599
It's not your fault.

788
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,920
So I didn't go.

789
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,159
Actually, she got hurt because of me.

790
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:20,809
I'm responsible.

791
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Yes.

792
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,239
That's why with one thing leading after another,

793
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,639
I feel anxious.

794
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,289
With her condition now,

795
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:30,440
even after she is discharged,

796
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,039
it'll take some time for her to recover.

797
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,360
After all, she had surgery, right?

798
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Right now,

799
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:38,719
you don't have any income.

800
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:41,039
You even have to pay Shi Yi's wages.

801
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,960
Actually,

802
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,920
it's a heavy burden to you too.

803
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
It just so happens...

804
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,599
that there's someone...

805
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,480
who can take care of Shi Yi better than you right now.

806
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,960
He can give Shi Yi everything she needs.

807
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,079
As Shi Yi's good friend,

808
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,519
what should you do?

809
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,840
So Shi Yi found a new job. Is that right?

810
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,559
Let's just say that.

811
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,960
Who is it?

812
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,559
Lan Qi.

813
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
You've met him.

814
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,119
Yes.

815
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
This child...

816
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,329
is talented and successful.

817
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,960
He has a good career too.

818
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:27,599
He had a relationship with Shi Yi in the past too.

819
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,440
He can offer Shi Yi better working conditions.

820
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:33,769
What's important is...

821
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,119
it's an easy job and there's no danger.

822
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,159
Moreover, it can maximize Shi Yi's value.
