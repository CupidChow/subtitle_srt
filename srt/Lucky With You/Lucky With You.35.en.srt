4
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Mom.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,040
Why did you suddenly side with me just now?

6
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,719
It caught me off guard.

7
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,519
You reminded me of my old self.

8
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,519
When I divorced your dad,

9
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,359
everyone was against it.

10
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,400
They said if I got divorced when I was almost 40,

11
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,560
I wouldn't be able to find someone...

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
who treats me as well as your dad does.

13
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,439
But I did it anyway.

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,239
No one else can understand the life that we want.

15
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,090
We don't need everyone to understand us either.

16
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,560
Yes, that's right.

17
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,000
You're very independent.

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,280
Actually, independence is developed from hardships.

19
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm so ashamed.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,810
I have no idea what you've been through all these years.

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,199
But...

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
compared to the last time you went through a breakup,

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,120
it's obvious that you've matured.

24
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,159
As parents,

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,000
we just want our children to be safe...

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
and have a smooth life.

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,599
But you weren't meant to live a normal life.

28
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,919
I won't be so stubborn anymore.

29
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,400
You still can't let go of Hou Jue, right?

30
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,280
No.

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,719
Why are you dragging him into everything?

32
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,520
You can't stop fate from pulling you two together.

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,879
I think...

34
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,759
we should just let things go with the flow.

35
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,319
You're off. Why aren't you going home?

36
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm nervous.

37
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,120
I know you're nervous too.

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,240
Let's be nervous together for a bit.

39
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,199
We're going to war tomorrow.

40
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,680
Every single cell in my body...

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,439
is excited right now.

42
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,800
Do you think we can win?

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,919
My dad told me...

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,240
to never be too confident that you'll win.

45
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,759
Shi Yi told me...

46
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,039
that when they compete in a match,

47
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,599
they never think about whether they'll win or lose.

48
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,840
Do you know what's on their mind?

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,759
They just want to use every single move...

50
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,879
that they've done in training.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
That's enough.

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,560
That's how we are right now.

53
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,560
That makes sense.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,279
We'll just think of it as going to an exam...

55
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,480
to test the fruits of our labor.

56
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,279
I feel like going on stage...

57
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
already counts as winning.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
But...

59
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,279
my cervical vertebra is telling me...

60
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,959
that a miracle will happen.

61
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,610
Your cervical vertebra...

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,800
seems reliable.

63
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,519
How do you think things are at your dad's company now?

64
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,199
My dad loves challenges.

65
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,560
He...

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,639
is probably nervously scolding people right now.

67
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,639
I can imagine.

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,839
This has been revised many times.

69
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,610
Why are there still mistakes with the annotations?

70
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,399
I'm sorry, Mr. Hou.

71
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,000
You've all been working here for nothing, right?

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,759
If the client sees such a rookie mistake,

73
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,839
I'm not the one who'll be embarrassed.

74
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,480
You're all useless!

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Ma Yong!

76
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,399
Hurry up and fix it.

77
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,959
- Yes. - Okay.

78
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,800
Hello.

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,079
I'll be giving you a presentation on our proposal now.

80
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,519
For this project,

81
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,399
the heart of our design...

82
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,800
is a structure without compromising the aesthetics.

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
World-renowned architect I. M. Pei once said that...

84
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,319
architecture is a form of social art.

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Daylighting will also allow a better view of the sea.

86
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,319
Thank you.

87
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,240
That's my presentation. Thank you.

88
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,480
Thank you for your proposal.

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,399
Please rest in the VIP room first.

90
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,959
Let us invite the next company in.

91
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,800
Your presentation was really good just now.

92
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,279
Okay.

93
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
Mr. Hou, please rest here for a while.

94
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Once we have the results, we'll notify you immediately.

95
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,759
I'll get going then.

96
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,560
Great King Company's presentation will begin shortly.

97
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay.

98
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,000
Hold on.

99
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,839
Great King Company?

100
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,439
From what I know,

101
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,759
Great King Company doesn't know how to design.

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,160
They hired an external design team.

103
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,639
They're called Hedgehog Factory.

104
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,600
Okay, rest here for a bit.

105
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,399
- Okay. I'll head over there now. - Thank you.

106
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
Hedgehog Factory?

107
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,319
I've never heard of them.

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
Hedgehog Factory...

109
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
Okay, let's take a break.

110
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,879
Hedgehog Factory...

111
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,480
Mr. Hou.

112
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,240
The bidding is over.

113
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,279
The bidding is just a formality anyway.

114
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,679
It's like this.

115
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,159
We regret to inform you...

116
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,879
that Great King Company has won this project.

117
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,120
What do you mean?

118
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,090
- You won the bid. - We won the bid?

119
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,639
Your proposal was extremely well-prepared,

120
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,879
but Great King's proposal is much more interesting.

121
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,759
Moreover, the vote was unanimous.

122
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm extremely sorry.

123
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,330
Are they the hedgehogs you were talking about?

124
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,159
Yes, it's that group of young people.

125
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,480
- We have to have a feast! - Let's arrange it.

126
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,720
Give us a pay raise.

127
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,210
- Let's go! - Let's celebrate.

Okay, go ahead.

Okay, I'll ask him for you.

Okay. All right.

135
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,159
All right.

136
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,159
Mr. Hou, Ms. Liao wants to know when you're going to the office.

137
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,320
She says it's urgent.

138
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,960
What's the matter with these people?

139
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Do they have to wait for me to do everything?

140
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,240
They won't even let me breathe.

141
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,559
Mr. Hou, are you all right?

142
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,080
You're all hoping something will happen to me, aren't you?

143
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,039
I'm not your clown.

144
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,799
Go.

145
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Go!

146

Mr. Hou.

147
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,639
Mr. Hou. Here, have some water.

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,879
Mr. Hou.

149
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,159
Is there anything else?

150
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,519
Mr. Hou, after this month,

151
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,559
I have a family emergency.

152
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,399
I have to go home tomorrow.

153
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,639
Why?

154
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,000
My son called me and said...

155
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,759
that his wife is about to give birth.

156
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,799
You're telling me you're leaving in such a hurry.

157
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,639
Can you give it a few days?

158
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,120
Can you wait until I've found a new housekeeper?

159
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,879
Actually, no one is home.

160
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,120
What if I forfeit this month's pay?

161
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,840
Does it look like I can't afford your salary?

162
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,279
I'll pay your entire salary for this month.

163
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,519
Leave now.

164
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Go!

165
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,200
You can all leave! Scram, all of you!

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,639
I...

169
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,960
I'm dying.

170
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,960
Help me.

171
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,559
What happened to my dad?

172
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,559
Dad.

173
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,920
Your dad is stable for now.

174
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,410
Don't disturb the patient.

175
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,319
Let's talk outside. Come on.

176
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,960
Your dad had a heart attack due to high blood pressure,

177
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,079
leading to palpitations.

178
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,279
The patient must be careful to regulate his emotions...

179
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,240
and stay positive.

180
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,279
However, your dad had a prior cerebral infarction.

181
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,920
He has atherosclerosis.

182
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,119
He also has high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.

183
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,799
After doing an electrocardiogram,

184
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,319
we saw that he may even have coronary heart disease.

185
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,119
Why has his health become like this?

186
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,839
When did he get all these illnesses?

187
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,480
Your dad has already been seeing me for five years.

188
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,519
He has been maintaining his health with medicine.

189
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,799
In the future,

190
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,240
don't let your dad do any work...

191
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,759
that will bring him a lot of stress.

192
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,759
He needs to rest.

193
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,559
Yes. I've never seen him take a break all these years.

194
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,519
He has to be careful after he is discharged.

195
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,720
You must bring your dad for regular checkups.

196
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,650
Don't let him come by himself.

197
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,240
As his son,

198
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,799
you have to personally accompany him here.

199
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,960
- Okay. - All right.

200
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,319
Thank you, doctor.

201
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,799
Okay.

202
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,359
Your responsiveness has slowed down.

203
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,559
What are you thinking about?

204
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,200
Nothing.

205
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,559
Being in love sure makes a difference.

206
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,650
Even your skin looks better.

207
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't tease me.

208
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,759
What's the saying?

209
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,410
As long as you're with someone you like,

210
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,839
you're happy even just eating bran.

211
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,039
But if you're with someone you don't like,

212
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,319
even the most luxurious foods taste bland.

213
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,680
That's right.

214
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,319
Now that I'm with you,

215
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,960
even drinking water is like drinking honey, okay?

216
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,799
How sweet.

217
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,170
(Zhou Quan)

218
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,279
Hello.

219
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,200
Hello, it's me. Hou Zhi Rong is sick.

220
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,650
But he's okay now.

221
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,960
He has been moved from the ER to a hospital room.

222
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
Hou Jue has been at the hospital...

223
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,279
ever since getting the call.

224
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,799
I don't think he's in good condition right now.

225
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,839
If you have time,

226
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,480
come over.

227
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,200
- He could use some encouragement. - Okay, I got it. Thank you.

228
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,410
What's wrong?

229
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,890
Hou Zhi Rong is in the hospital.

230
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,920
He's in the hospital?

231
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,680
So what's his situation now?

232
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,920
They moved him to a regular room.

233
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,240
He should be fine now.

234
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm going to go now. I'll go and take a look.

235
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,170
I'll go with you.

236
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,890
Don't you have class later?

237
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,000
Take my car.

238
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,279
Take this water.

239
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,680
I'm leaving.

240
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,079
The index levels haven't changed much.

241
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,359
We have to observe him carefully.

242
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,410
Why are you here?

243
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,359
Zhou Quan called me,

244
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,759
so I came to take a look.

245
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,480
How's Mr. Hou?

246
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,920
He hasn't woken up yet.

247
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,119
What did the doctor say?

248
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,200
He has a bunch of illnesses.

249
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
It's a result of fatigue.

250
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,170
Don't worry. He'll be okay.

251
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,079
It's my fault. I never paid attention to his health.

252
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,720
He was busy with the bid every day.

253
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,920
This probably also happened because he was too upset...

254
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
about losing the bid.

255
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,519
Otherwise, he wouldn't have collapsed so quickly.

256
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,400
You can't be blamed.

257
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,039
I'm sure he didn't want you to know.

258
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,319
Mr. Hou is too prideful and eager to be good at everything.

259
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,640
Why does he need to compete with his own son?

260
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Who else can he tell about his health problems?

261
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,279
I should've known about this.

262
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,440
When he fainted in the company last time,

263
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,880
I should have paid more attention and asked him more questions.

264
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I accompanied him to the hospital...

265
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,279
and he started lecturing me the moment we sat down.

266
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,960
I can't stand that.

267
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,519
It's also my fault.

268
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,319
I kept playing around.

269
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,559
All I did was make him mad.

270
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,519
I couldn't do anything right.

271
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
Stop blaming yourself.

272
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,440
At least you won the bid.

273
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,400
As for Mr. Hou,

274
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,720
he'll be gratified...

275
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,759
that he lost to his son.

276
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,000
I really wanted to win this bid.

277
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,160
But I want my family's company to do well even more.

278
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,559
Who doesn't want to help their own family's company do well?

279
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,480
But my dad is too strong.

280
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
If you really stayed in the company,

281
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,119
it may not have necessarily been a good thing.

282
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,119
Without experiencing all this,

283
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,279
I don't think...

284
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,000
you would be able to understand your dad like this today.

285
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,640
Who knows?

286
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,240
All right, don't think too much.

287
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,759
It's not too late to be nicer to him from now on.

288
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,079
If I'm not nice to him, who will?

289
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm the only one left.

290
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,160
Hello.

291
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,000
Slow down.

292
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,000
What's wrong?

293
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:35,240
I'm coming.

294
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,160
What's wrong? What happened?

295
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
Since my dad has collapsed,

296
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,920
the company is a mess now.

297
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,759
I have to go back and take care of things.

298
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,799
You go then.

299
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,359
Don't worry. I'll keep watch here.

300
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,160
- I'll call you if there's anything. - Okay.

301
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,359
Go home, take a shower, and get changed.

302
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,079
- Pull yourself together. - Okay, thank you.

303
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,640
Zhou Quan.

304
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,039
Thank you.

305
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,680
Apparently, it was pretty serious.

306
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,079
- Yes. - I heard that too.

307
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,839
- Hello, Mr. Hou Junior. - Hello, Mr. Hou Junior.

308
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,599
Look at this. It's so fun. Did you see this?

309
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,640
My gosh.

310
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,880
Everyone.

311
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,480
I have a few words to say.

312
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,599
My dad, Hou Zhi Rong,

313
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,079
due to health reasons,

314
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,839
will be stepping down from his position...

315
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,480
as the CEO of Zhirong Construction.

316
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,240
Starting today,

317
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,200
I will be taking over as Zhirong Construction's CEO.

318
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,640
Right now,

319
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
the CEO has fallen ill,

320
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,440
the CEO's assistant has been arrested,

321
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,440
and we've lost the bid.

322
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,000
We're in a financial strait.

323
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,519
This is our company's current situation.

324
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,119
I'm still inexperienced,

325
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,880
so it's clear that we'll have a tough path ahead...

326
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,720
after I take over.

327
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,359
So if anyone here wants to leave,

328
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,519
no matter what,

329
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:31,359
I'll give you severance pay.

330
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,240
If you want to stay,

331
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,119
you have to prepare yourselves.

332
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,279
You're going to go through some difficult times with me.

333
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,279
In half an hour,

334
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,200
I'll be holding my first meeting...

335
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,880
after taking the reins in the conference room.

336
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,759
I'll wait for you there.

337
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,880
If you want to leave,

338
00:25:58,279 --> 00:25:59,440
go to Zhou Quan...

339
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
and leave your name.

340
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,160
Inform the deputy directors.

341
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,240
This is so sudden.

342
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,640
- This is so sudden. - What's going on?

343
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,839
- Are you leaving? - Are you staying or leaving?

344
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,160
As usual, I didn't add any sugar.

345
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,119
You've informed everyone, right?

346
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,039
I've informed everyone I could.

347
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,319
Have a seat.

348
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,279
Sit down.

349
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,640
Hello, Mr. Hou.

350
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,240
I'm sorry. We couldn't retain more people.

351
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,720
It's okay. Please have a seat.

352
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm very grateful...

353
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
that you all came here...

354
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,279
to attend this meeting.

355
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
First of all,

356
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,680
on behalf of my dad,

357
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,079
let me bow to you all.

358
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
To all the seniors of the company,

359
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,920
I'm already very grateful...

360
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,160
that you're willing to stay.

361
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,599
My grandpa started this company.

362
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,839
He started out from nothing.

363
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,160
It actually wasn't easy...

364
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,920
to make it to my dad's generation.

365
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,079
Seeing you all staying here...

366
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,400
and sitting here today,

367
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,799
I'm very grateful.

368
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,480
I thank you all for your trust and support.

369
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,279
I want to emphasize this.

370
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm really happy to see you.

371
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,279
Zhirong has gotten to where it is today...

372
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,680
after experiencing several setbacks.

373
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,960
I've personally experienced it.

374
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,079
So I won't get scared off by these hardships in front of us.

375
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,920
Recently,

376
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,279
I was also demotivated.

377
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,480
But...

378
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,559
I have an emotional attachment to Zhirong.

379
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,160
So I decided to stay.

380
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,200
I'll work hard with all of you...

381
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,960
to restore our company's grandeur.

382
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,960
To be honest, Mr. Hou Junior,

383
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,480
I actually hesitated for a long time...

384
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,000
before deciding to stay.

385
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,759
I'm in charge of the company's day-to-day operations.

386
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm worried that if I leave,

387
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,519
you won't be able to handle it alone.

388
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,039
That's why I decided to stay.

389
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,880
But let me make myself clear.

390
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm only helping you out for the time being...

391
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,599
while I observe the situation.

392
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,200
If you can't lead everyone...

393
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,799
to restore our company's grandeur,

394
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,119
I'll leave anytime.

395
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,200
It's okay.

396
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,799
The company is allowing everyone to come and go as they wish now.

397
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,920
I'm planning...

398
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,920
to make a small adjustment.

399
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,920
I want to segregate the Design Department...

400
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,160
from everything else...

401
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,640
and then everyone will move there to work together.

402
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,559
Then we'll sublet the rest of the extra offices.

403
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,960
We don't have many employees now,

404
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,440
so we don't need that much space.

405
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,359
That way, we can all be closer.

406
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,119
Secondly, I can lessen some of the company's burden.

407
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,319
Mr. Hou Junior, I support your idea.

408
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,319
Before my dad collapsed,

409
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,079
most of the company's projects were almost coming to an end,

410
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,400
except for the Haicheng No.8 project.

411
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
So these days, the company...

412
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,559
may need some projects...

413
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,839
to stabilize our team.

414
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,240
We'll also need cash flow.

415
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,160
Great King...

416
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,240
won the Ruiji Hotel bid.

417
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,240
But they lack experience.

418
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,119
They also don't have any professionals,

419
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,039
so they're looking for partners.

420
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,279
I think we can try working with them this time.

421
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,839
I'll do my best...

422
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,039
to get some benefits for our company.

423
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,119
Hou Jue.

424
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,640
You don't mind...

425
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,920
- if I call you that, right? - It's okay.

426
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,920
I'm also a senior in this company.

427
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,200
I've been in this company...

428
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,519
since the time when Mr. Hou Senior was here.

429
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,359
Yes, you've been working here...

430
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,680
longer than I've been alive.

431
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,079
Yes.

432
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,759
I watched you grow up.

433
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,799
Seeing you sit here today...

434
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,759
makes me just as happy as seeing my own child.

435
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,279
You have Mr. Hou's resolution and responsibility...

436
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,079
while having your own benevolence and generosity.

437
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,480
All right.

438
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,480
To protect this ship with you,

439
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,680
I'll postpone my retirement for 10 years.

440
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,720
It would be great if my dad could see me the way you do.

441
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,039
Mr. Hou Junior, to be honest,

442
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,039
when I first came here,

443
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,039
I felt the atmosphere of the company was quite depressing.

444
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,759
I was thinking of leaving to a more vibrant company,

445
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
but you're here now.

446
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,160
I won't leave.

447
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,839
After all, an energetic and competent boss like you...

448
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,079
is hard to come by.

449
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Besides,

450
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,319
even if I do run into one,

451
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,960
they might not hire me.

452
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
When I first met Mr. Hou Junior,

453
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,039
I was carrying so many things.

454
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,640
Mr. Hou Junior opened the door for me...

455
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,359
and helped me carry some stuff.

456
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,799
I was so touched.

457
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,920
Now, Mr. Hou Junior is the one who needs help.

458
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,240
- I can't turn my back on him. - That's right.

459
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,359
I love working overtime with Mr. Hou Junior.

460
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
He always orders delicious food.

461
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,000
If I go to another company,

462
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
I'm afraid I won't be able to have that.

463
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,440
Mr. Hou Junior.

464
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,079
I...

465
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
I've been Mr. Hou's secretary for six years.

466
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,039
Now, Mr. Hou is stepping down from the frontline.

467
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,720
If I stay in the company,

468
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,880
with my abilities,

469
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,559
I'm not sure if I'll really be able to help you.

470
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,039
Don't say that.

471
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,839
Actually, each of you staying behind...

472
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,200
gives me a lot of encouragement.

473
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It's true.

474
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,599
It has been two years since I graduated.

475
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,319
I've changed 7 to 8 companies,

476
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,599
but I stayed at Zhirong the longest.

477
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:29,279
That's because Mr. Hou Junior is here.

478
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,880
Li Li, I have a girlfriend now.

479
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,359
No.

480
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,759
I mean...

481
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,680
With Mr. Hou Junior around,

482
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,880
we have fun at work every day.

483
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,759
We can learn a lot too.

484
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,480
I used to be quite lazy,

485
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,319
but now, I'm also very motivated.

486
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,960
After hearing everything you've said, it seems like...

487
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm quite a nice person.

488
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,759
Zhirong hasn't had...

489
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
such a lively meeting in so many years.

490
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,920
It feels like we've gone back to the times...

491
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,039
when we fought tough battles with Mr. Hou.

492
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,279
So as long as we have the will,

493
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,920
there's nothing we can't overcome.

494
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,960
Yes.

495
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,920
Okay, although there aren't...

496
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,159
that many people left,

497
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,039
we've actually...

498
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,329
strengthened the team.

499
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,519
Now we're an elite unit.

500
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,159
Let's do our best together, okay?

501
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,559
- We can do it! - We can do it!

502
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Xiao Han, why are you here?

503
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,480
I only just heard that Mr. Hou has fallen ill.

504
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,960
So I thought I'd come and take a look.

505
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,079
Thank you, buddy.

506
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,329
Even though we beat Mr. Hou,

507
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,400
seeing him like this now,

508
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,769
I feel...

509
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,880
Don't think too much.

510
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
But remember.

511
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,880
You did an amazing job this time.

512
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Thank you, buddy.

513
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,679
Don't stay here.

514
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,679
We can't both be here.

515
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,000
The company needs people.

516
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,119
Go back to work.

517
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,159
All right, I'll leave now.

518
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,289
Let me know if you need anything.

519
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:29,289
I'll call you if there's anything.

520
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:30,679
All right. Go.

521
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,000
How is it? Is the company all right?

522
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,289
It's fine.

523
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,719
Dad.

524
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:53,329
Dad.

525
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:55,440
Dad, you're awake.

526
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,639
How do you feel?

527
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,639
- I'll go and get the doctor. - Okay.

528
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,360
My head hurts and I'm tired.

529
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
Are you tired?

530
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,809
How long...

531
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,079
How long have I been asleep?

532
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,400
You've slept for an entire day.

533
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,199
I haven't slept for so long at once in so many years.

534
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,360
How comfortable.

535
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,159
Shi Yi, you're here too.

536
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,679
Mr. Hou.

537
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,000
Shi Yi.

538
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:39,159
I'm so glad you're by Hou Jue's side.

539
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,679
Thank you for saving me at the company that time.

540
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,880
You also saved Hou Jue.

541
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,840
You're our family's savior.

542
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,809
Don't mention it.

543
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,159
It's my job.

544
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,639
What do you mean she saved you at work?

545
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,289
When did you save my dad?

546
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Who was that?

547
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Who was that?

548
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,000
When my dad was held hostage at the company last time,

549
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,239
you were the one who threw me down.

550
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:27,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

551
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,239
What for? What's there to say?

552
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,360
Dad, you should have told me.

553
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Be gentle.

554
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,199
Why did you hit me so hard?

555
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,840
Do you still see me as your dad?

556
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
You're right.

557
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,559
Let me ask you.

558
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,039
Did you do...

559
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,920
the proposal for the Ruiji Hotel bid?

560
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,329
That proposal...

561
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,599
was done using my design as a foundation,

562
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,480
then Bao Xiao Han led us through it all.

563
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:56,519
That's good too.

564
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,039
You're able to play a pivotal role now.

565
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,000
See? I told you.

566
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:04,289
Mr. Hou will surely be gratified.

567
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:07,400
My dad is just muddled from being sick.

568
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,079
He would never compliment me, right?

569
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,159
I'm not muddled.

570
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:16,289
A son surpassing his father is a good thing.

571
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,039
Do you know how long I've waited for this day?

572
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,719
I don't want to wait another day.

573
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,039
Come here.

574
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,880
From today onwards,

575
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,559
you're the new chairman of Zhirong Construction.

576
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,289
I announce my resignation.

577
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,920
Dad, you're too late.

578
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,360
It's a new era for the company now.

579
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm no longer Mr. Hou Junior.

580
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,519
I'm Chairman Hou.

581
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,639
You should focus on restoring your health.

582
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,719
Until then, don't ask anything...

583
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,719
or worry about anything.

584
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,960
Hurry up and recover.

585
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,329
Our company still needs you.

586
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:03,079
This kid isn't even officially the chairman yet,

587
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,239
but look at him.

588
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,239
What a smooth talker.

589
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,199
It's all thanks to you, Shi Yi.

590
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Thank you.

591
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,289
I...

592
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,000
All right. Get some sleep.

593
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Stop talking.

594
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,329
Are you sure you don't need my help?

595
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Yes, I'm sure.

596
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,679
My dad is different. He didn't have surgery.

597
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll just stay here with him.

598
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,039
People used to call you Mr. Hou Junior.

599
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,039
From now on...

600
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,880
From now on, you can call me Hou Jue.

601
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,119
Or you can even call me Little Monkey.

602
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:44,360
I'll call you that if you dare to agree to it.

603
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,480
Call me that then.

604
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Little Monkey.

605
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,329
Now that your dad has suddenly fallen sick,

606
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,440
you have to take care of the company now.

607
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,840
I'm just...

608
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,840
managing the company for now.

609
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:02,400
I want to hire a professional manager...

610
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,519
to manage it later on.

611
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,679
Are you handing over your family business to an outsider?

612
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,199
I'm not handing it over to an outsider.

613
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,920
I'm just a designer.

614
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,199
I don't know anything about management.

615
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,039
Besides, I think...

616
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,480
Zhirong Construction ended up like this today...

617
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,480
because there's a big problem here.

618
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,199
It's our family business model.

619
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,769
In the future, if the company wants to be bigger and stronger...

620
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,159
and retain more talent,

621
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,199
we have to let a professional manage it.

622
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,199
Ownership and management rights need to be separated.

623
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,880
I didn't expect you to be so smart...

624
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,159
and so open-minded.

625
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Think about it.

626
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,360
My grandpa and my dad...

627
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,239
Their two generations worked hard all their lives...

628
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,079
to build this ladder for me.

629
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,000
I have to protect it.

630
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,440
I have to keep it going.

631
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,599
I have to leave it for my son.

632
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,920
You're thinking quite far ahead.

633
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,119
I have to think far ahead.

634
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,809
Because I've already included you in my future plans.

635
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Then...

636
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,400
if you don't need me, I'll get going now.

637
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Are you leaving now?

638
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,329
I'm leaving.

639
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
Go on.

640
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:20,039
Bye, Little Monkey.

641
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,039
Bye.

642
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Hou Jue.

643
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,679
Tell me.

644
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,920
At what stage are you in your relationship with Shi Yi?

645
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
Don't even ask.

646
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,329
It was going pretty well before,

647
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,000
but after you kept messing things up,

648
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:06,880
it has just become...

649
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,960
an innocent friendship.

650
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,239
What do you mean I messed things up?
