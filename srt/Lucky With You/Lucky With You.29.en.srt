4
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,359
The flowers are so beautiful.

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,319
Where are we going to eat?

6
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello, Mr. Lan.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,919
Wu Shi Yi of Eagle Security reporting for duty.

8
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,879
Welcome.

9
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,159
Let me introduce you.

10
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,759
Hua Hua, Ting Fen, Ma Chao, Guo Hai.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,039
Hello.

12
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,159
- Hello, Mr. Lan. - Hello, Mr. Lan.

13
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,879
Your dormitory is ready. It's over there.

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,530
Take the car there and someone will pick you up.

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,280
Listen to Mr. Lan.

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Shi Yi.

17
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
I'll show you around to get familiar with the place.

18
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,199
- Sure. - Come on.

19
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,120
This is our lobby.

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,560
Not bad, right?

21
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,360
Right.

22
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,800
Our hotel executives all live on the top floor.

23
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,360
For your convenience,

24
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,479
I've also arranged for your room to be on the top floor.

25
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,719
Let's take a look outside.

26
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,280
This is the exterior of our hotel.

27
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,960
Last time,

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,719
your parents have already checked out the place.

29
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,759
They quite like it.

30
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,599
The sea...

31
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,439
does open up people's hearts indeed.

32
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,120
Come in.

33
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,400
This is my office.

34
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
We have seven partners.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,759
The other six don't usually come here.

36
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,919
We only have a regular annual meeting.

37
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,800
They usually only come here for a vacation.

38
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,639
I'm the only one here.

39
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,080
By the way, our company's security...

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,879
has always been handled by the Banks Corporation.

41
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,639
They're one of our shareholders.

42
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,480
Then what's the main job for me and my team?

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,519
Mainly,

44
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,439
you'll be responsible for my personal safety.

45
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,560
I don't need you to escort me 24-7,

46
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,199
but you can't leave the hotel as you like.

47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,279
You have to travel with me.

48
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,480
Got it.

49
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,680
Also, for some hotel events,

50
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,839
you'll have to work together with the security team.

51
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,879
Our hotel will be officially opened in two weeks.

52
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,399
All the shareholders and guests will be here.

53
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,199
You and your team will have specific tasks to handle.

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,560
You'll be on a tight schedule and have a big task.

55
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,120
That seems a little too easy.

56
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,839
Isn't that a good thing?

57
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,879
You're usually always so tense.

58
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,120
What's wrong?

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
It's suddenly so relaxed.

60
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,279
I'm not used to it.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Then how about this?

62
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,399
I'll find myself an enemy soon.

63
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,639
That was kind of lame.

64
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,279
Though appendicitis is not a big deal,

65
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,439
you've had surgery after all.

66
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,800
You still need to recover.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
Then we can work better, right?

68
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

69
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
I'll get back to work.

70
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,959
Block him.

71
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
This way. Here.

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,759
This way.

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,399
Catch.

74
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,439
- This way. - Block them.

75
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,680
Come on, let's gather and train.

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,199
Yes.

77
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,879
I have some personal issues.

78
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,920
(Peng Cheng Electric Car)

79
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,279
So it's up to you.

80
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,360
Anyway, I won't give much.

81
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Just half.

82
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,600
Because...

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,240
- There's no use for me to say it. - Hai Xing.

84
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,759
That's all. I'm hanging up.

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
- Hai Xing. - Ms. Zhang.

86
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,839
- I've missed you so much. - Yes.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
- Take a seat. - Sure.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,560
It's been a while. How are you?

89
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,879
Yes.

90
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,160
After Hou Jue moved out,

91
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,759
I went back to my hometown in Sichuan.

92
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,839
I just came back from there.

93
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,399
I brought them some sausages and meat.

94
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,439
Hou Jue has loved them since he was a child.

95
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,759
Shi Yi too.

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,639
So I brought some for them.

97
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
That Mr. Zhao...

98
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,199
The one from my hometown.

99
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,839
- Mr. Tian? - Yes, he knows how to cook these.

100
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,240
Let him cook for them.

101
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,480
I'll get you some water.

102
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,639
There's no need.

103
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,920
Where are they?

104
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,959
Upstairs, in the room.

105
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,759
Go. Get those brats for me.

106
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,680
Tell them Ms. Zhang is here. Go.

107
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,959
Well, Monkey is still sleeping.

108
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,040
Shi Yi is not here anymore.

109
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,000
What's going on?

110
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Attention!

111
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,560
Right turn.

112
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,759
At ease.

113
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,360
That's all for today.

114
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,800
You are dismissed.

115
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,519
Ms. Shi Yi, take a photo of us.

116
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,600
Forget it. Let's take a break.

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
Okay, let's take a picture.

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
Hurry up. I don't think you're tired.

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,639
You're not tired.

120
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,040
- Here. - Come on.

121
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,639
Here.

122
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,960
- Let's jump on one, two, three. - Here.

123
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
Come on.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,759
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

125
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,090
Again!

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,210
- Again? - One more.

127
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,210
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

128
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,759
- Ms. Qian! - Ms. Qian, why are you here?

129
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,519
Stop. Don't come closer.

130
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,879
You're all sweaty.

131
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't touch me.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ms. Qian.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
Aren't you monkeys tired?

134
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,639
You're not tired?

135
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,840
Come on, gather around.

136
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,159
Gather around.

137
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,120
Hurry up and gather around.

138
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,399
Head to the dorm.

139
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,960
Go back, wash up, and get changed.

140
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,600
Right turn.

141
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,450
Go.

142
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,330
Nice place you got here.

143
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,639
It's okay.

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Come on.

145
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,879
Let's sit down.

146
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,159
It's so nice here.

147
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,559
The beach is really nice.

148
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,799
It's beautiful.

149
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,919
Ms. Shi Yi, Ms. Qian.

150
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,450
Drinks for both of you.

151
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,720
- How thoughtful. - Thank you.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, I'm just here to get my phone.

153
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,919
I thought you didn't want it anymore.

154
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,450
- Here. - I'll let you two talk.

155
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,720
See you later, Ms. Shi Yi.

156
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,210
I have something serious to ask you.

157
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,679
What is it?

158
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,279
He hasn't called you?

159
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,559
No.

160
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,720
I guess his job is going well.

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
Look at you.

162
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,000
Get up now!

163
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,000
Do you hear me? Get up!

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,330
Get up now!

165
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,639
Why are you sleeping in broad daylight?

166
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,120
What did you tell me when you left the house?

167
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,210
You said you'd make it big out here...

168
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,240
and then you'd come to get me.

169
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,120
I've been waiting for you at home.

170
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,210
Is this how you make it big?

171
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,559
Your dad's right.

172
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,240
You're just a piece of trash.

173
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,360
Look at yourself.

174
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Shi Yi was right to leave you.

175
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
Ms. Zhang, I know about that.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,039
There's a misunderstanding.

177
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,080
Shut up.

178
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,399
I'm lecturing Hou Jue now.

179
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,799
It's none of your business.

180
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,440
Don't be mad, Ms. Zhang.

181
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Listen up.

182
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Listen up.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,279
I...

184
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,639
What was I going to say?

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,279
Who told you to interrupt?

186
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,879
I don't remember what I was going to say anymore.

187
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
Right, let me tell you.

188
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,639
You've never suffered in your life.

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,440
I said you couldn't do it and you didn't believe me.

190
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,399
You insisted on leaving.

191
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,519
Look.

192
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,480
Look what happened.

193
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,799
Here you are.

194
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,879
Be humble if you can't do anything right.

195
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,840
Go home and apologize to your dad.

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,120
From now on,

197
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,600
work hard with your dad.

198
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm not going back.

199
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
Ms. Zhang, sit down. Don't be angry.

200
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,840
How can I sit down?

201
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,240
How can I sit down when you're like this?

202
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,600
Don't be mad.

203
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,960
Have a seat.

204
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm so mad at you.

205
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,679
Communicate to the night duty managers.

206
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,440
- These are the last few days. - Okay.

207
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,919
- I don't want any problems. - Okay.

208
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,440
If I find any problems,

209
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,679
- they'll be fired. - Okay.

210
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,799
- All right, go ahead. - Okay.

211
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
I came...

212
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,720
to tell you something.

213
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
What is it?

214
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
Shi Yi.

215
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
I've been looking for you.

216
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,679
Mr. Lan.

217
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,240
Qian Xiao Yan,

218
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
the coach at my company.

219
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,759
This is Mr. Lan Qi.

220
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,600
- Hello, Ms. Qian. - Hello, Mr. Lan.

221
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,799
Right.

222
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,480
I've cleared out the villa.

223
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
Your parents have agreed to stay here for a few days...

224
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,039
and attend our hotel's opening party.

225
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,799
When did they agree?

226
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,879
That doesn't matter. I'm just letting you know.

227
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,559
You two talk. I'll get back to work.

228
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,039
Ms. Qian, if you want to eat, the staff meal here is quite good.

229
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,120
You can try them.

230
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,039
No, I have plans tonight. Thank you.

231
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,879
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,039
Bye.

233
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,519
Goodness.

234
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,559
He treats you well.

235
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,159
He's even taking care of your family.

236
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
They never seem...

237
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,279
to make decisions with my consent.

238
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,879
You don't have feelings for him?

239
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,039
I think Lan Qi is pretty good.

240
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,480
There's an emotional foundation between you two.

241
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,639
He's good to your parents.

242
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,120
You two know each other well.

243
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm serious. Don't give up so easily, okay?

244
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,879
Give him a chance.

245
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,120
Perhaps when you connect with each other,

246
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,000
your old feelings will start to come back.

247
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,519
No way.

248
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,799
What did you want to tell me?

249
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
He interrupted me. I forgot.

250
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,320
It doesn't matter.

251
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Well...

252
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,639
Bring me to check out your dorm.

253
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,519
Come on.

254
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,840
Let's go.

255
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
This way.

256
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,759
Ms. Zhang.

257
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,759
I've disappointed you, Ms. Zhang.

258
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
Don't be mad anymore.

259
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,919
What are you going to do now?

260
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,799
Are you going to keep sleeping here or get a job?

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,120
Of course I have to work.

262
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,679
I'm on it.

263
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,919
Hello, the number you've dialed is turned off.

264
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,000
Sorry.

265
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,200
What's going on?

266
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
Boss.

267
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,600
Who was that lady?

268
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,759
She was so fierce.

269
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,360
She looks scary, but she's nice.

270
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
That's Ms. Zhang, Hou Jue's housekeeper.

271
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,480
I don't want it.

272
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,799
She's like his real mom.

273
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,399
What are you doing now?

274
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,759
Why are you asking so many questions?

275
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,919
10 yuan for one question.

276
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,120
You're asking thousands of them.

277
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,200
What if I really give you 10 yuan...

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,639
but you can't answer my question?

279
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,960
Go watch the noodles.

280
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,279
Less talking.

281
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,360
I just know...

282
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,759
that you're cooking noodles for Hou Jue again.

283
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,840
Yes. Who else am I cooking for?

284
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,440
Look at his behavior for the past few days.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
I can't do anything about it.

286
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,200
I can only be anxious.

287
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,639
It's good that Ms. Zhang is here.

288
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,120
She should be able to get him to his senses.

289
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,000
I...

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
can only show him that I care.

291
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,919
So I'm making him some hangover noodles.

292
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,480
All right, move.

293
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,759
Anyway, I know that you're a good person.

294
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,159
Get out.

295
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,320
Go and help out.

296
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,799
Have some hangover noodles to sober up.

297
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,000
Can you stand it if you keep drinking like that?

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,120
No.

299
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,679
You just keep drinking...

300
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,240
and won't eat.

301
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,480
You too.

302
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm going to Shenzhen.

303
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,919
What?

304
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,559
I went there last time for a business meeting.

305
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,919
I didn't sign the contract because I was in a hurry.

306
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,159
But they're interested in my project.

307
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll look for that company again.

308
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,720
I'll see if I can collaborate with them.

309
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,440
That's great news. We have to support it.

310
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,840
That's better.

311
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,279
One bite for you.

312
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,639
No.

313
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,120
Seriously.

314
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,960
Can you not make people worried?

315
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000
Gosh.

316
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,159
(Hai Xing)

317
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,399
Hello.

318
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,559
It's me.

319
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,759
What's up?

320
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,759
I just met Shi Yi.

321
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,680
She's doing well.

322
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,000
About Hou Jue,

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,839
I didn't tell her.

324
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,039
What does that mean?

325
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,359
What's well?

326
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,039
Is she really dating Lan Qi?

327
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,319
No. Have you thought about how Monkey would feel?

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,440
I feel bad, actually.

329
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,200
Just think that I'm being selfish.

330
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,680
Let bygones be bygones.

331
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,079
Mr. Hou.

332
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,920
For the past few days, we've contacted some new suppliers.

333
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,170
But it's as if they've all discussed.

334
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,839
They're all saying the same thing.

335
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,200
They want five percent above market value...

336
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,200
and be paid up-front.

337
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,799
These profiteers.

338
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,920
I don't know where they heard we stopped the construction.

339
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,519
They're inflating the prices.

340
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,119
Partnership is extremely difficult.

341
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,279
Yes.

342
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,410
Back then, when they begged us,

343
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,480
they wanted a six-month installment plan.

344
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,720
But now that we need them,

345
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,170
they have become so arrogant.

346
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,480
They've given us the price,

347
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,039
and want us to take it or leave it.

348
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,359
It's so funny.

349
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,359
They're trying to kick us while we're down.

350
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,039
Mr. Hou.

351
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,410
Please make a decision.

352
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,039
Since things are already like this,

353
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,890
I'll bow when I have to.

354
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll sign with whoever delivers the materials first.

355
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,759
We'll talk more after we get over this hurdle.

356
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
The meeting is adjourned.

357
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,240
- Mr. Hou. - Mr. Hou. That's inappropriate.

358
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,759
- Then we'll lose too much. - If we lose...

359
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
- What should we do? - Exactly.

360
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,650
Mr. Ma.

361
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Mr. Hou.

362
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,000
Today,

363
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,759
I'm reminded of when I first joined the company.

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,279
It was just like this.

365
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,650
There were problems with both the supplier and the purchaser.

366
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,720
We were attacked from all sides.

367
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,079
Do you remember?

368
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,720
We weren't paid wages for six months.

369
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,170
But in the end, under your leadership,

370
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,410
we overcame everything.

371
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,359
I think what you said earlier is especially true.

372
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,079
Bow your heads if you must.

373
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,079
I'm sure this obstacle will pass.

374
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,200
It's different this time.

375
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,680
What's the difference?

376
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,200
You're handling it.

377
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm old now.

378
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,039
You're overthinking it.

379
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,759
You're still a strong man.

380
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,599
Strong?

381
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,440
Mr. Hou.

382
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,079
Are you okay?

383
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,920
Mr. Hou.

384
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,920
Mr. Hou!

385
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,359
What's wrong?

386
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,480
Call 120! Call an ambulance! Hurry!

387
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,680
No! Come back!

388
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,650
Don't call 120.

389
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,839
I...

390
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,119
Medicine!

391
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,839
Be careful.

392
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,880
Breathe.

393
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,359
- Mr. Ma. The blue one. - Give me that.

394
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,559
Blue.

395
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,839
Blue.

396
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
Two.

397
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,359
Here.

398
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,359
Slowly. Okay.

399
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Is that better?

400
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,599
No. We should go to the hospital.

401
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,640
Just call an ambulance.

402
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,079
Don't call.

403
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,519
I told you not to call an ambulance!

404
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,720
You can't do this!

405
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,200
Stop talking!

406
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,279
It's not a good time to reveal this.

407
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,880
Our morale will be shaken.

408
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,839
Then I'll tell Hou Jue to come back.

409
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,200
I'll ask him to keep you company.

410
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
That way, you'll feel better.

411
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,440
I don't want Hou Jue to know I'm in such a mess!

412
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
I don't want people to know!

413
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,119
All right! I understand!

414
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,400
- Come on. - Don't touch me!

415
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,400
All right.

416
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
Xiao Wang, go.

417
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,960
Wait.

418
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,440
Don't let anyone know about his condition.

419
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Got it?

420
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,920
Okay. Go on.

421
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,240
You can go now. It's okay.

422
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,559
I feel better after taking the medicine.

423
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,920
All right.

424
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,400
I'll do as you say.

425
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,839
Don't worry.

426
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,119
At my age,

427
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,920
this is already very good.

428
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,200
Ma Yong.

429
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,720
Whenever something happens to me,

430
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
or when there's trouble,

431
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
it's always you who is by my side.

432
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,359
It's my duty.

433
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm old.

434
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,359
I don't want to get old.

435
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,200
No, don't think about that.

436
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,240
Give Mr. Zhang from the Finance Department a call.

437
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,279
- Tell him to come. - No.

438
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,880
Can you stop talking about work?

439
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,640
I'm begging you, okay?

440
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,400
Let's...

441
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,640
I'll take you home to rest.

442
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,279
If you keep talking about work,

443
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,119
your body won't be able to handle it!

444
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,319
By then, everything will be too late!

445
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm fine.

446
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
No, please listen to me.

447
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,559
Listen.

448
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,519
Call Mr. Zhang.

449
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,200
Call him and tell him to come.

450
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,680
Once I've talked with him,

451
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,359
you'll take me home right away.

452
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,319
Don't worry, okay?

453
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,200
Promise me.

454
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,359
I promise.

455
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,359
You'll go straight home after this.

456
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,400
Okay.

457
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,319
Give him a call.

458
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,160
Mr. Hou, Mr. Zhang has arrived.

459
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,480
Let him in.

460
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,000
Mr. Hou. Mr. Ma, you're here too.

461
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,400
Mr. Zhang.

462
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,160
During this time, any financial contract...

463
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,039
and large payments that need my signature,

464
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,880
let Mr. Ma sign them all.

465
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,680
No, Mr. Hou.

466
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,440
The company is facing such a situation.

467
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,519
It's too much responsibility.

468
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,599
Absolutely not.

469
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,680
If I say you can, you can.

470
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,559
No, it's just not appropriate.

471
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
You can do it.

472
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,880
When your signature is needed, sign it.

473
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,640
If you can't decide, you can come back to me.

474
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,720
Then every time before I sign anything,

475
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,640
I'd like to ask for your permission.

476
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,839
Didn't I tell you?

477
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,200
All right.

478
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,559
You may go.

479
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:12,640
Okay. I got it.

480
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,680
Okay.

481
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,039
Mr. Hou.

482
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,160
You trust me so much.

483
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,079
I really don't think I'm worthy enough.

484
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,519
Humans have to believe in something.

485
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,480
You're the only one I can trust...

486
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,119
and rely on now.

487
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,720
At a time like this,

488
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,839
my condition is acting up.

489
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,079
I don't want it either.

490
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,119
But I think it's God's way of telling me,

491
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
"Zhi Rong, it's time to let go."

492
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,920
Ma Yong.

493
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,359
I'm glad you're here.

494
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,279
Don't worry.

495
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,079
Lie down for a little.

496
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,519
Okay.

497
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,759
I'll lie down.

498
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,599
Why?

499
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,640
- He's good. - Why?

500
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,640
I gave it my all

501
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,519
But I'll never, never, never get you

502
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,640
Why?

503
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,200
Actually, there's no reason

504
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,000
It's probably just bad luck

505
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,559
But I will always work hard

506
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,000
For you

507
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,519
Thank you.

508
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,000
Enjoy, everyone.

509
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,599
Love will find a way.

510
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,759
If you like...

511
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,640
Are you okay?

512
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,880
- Let me see if you're hurt. - It's okay.

513
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,920
One problem at a time.

514
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
Mr. Tian, deal with the nail.

515
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,759
Nail?

516
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,799
- What nail? - Here.

517
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,359
- This nail? - Yes.

518
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,240
Hello, sir.

519
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,480
How can I help you?

520
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,359
Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Zhang.

521
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,319
Which Mr. Zhang?

522
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,960
Zhang Sheng.

523
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:38,599
Mr. Zhang has resigned a while ago.

524
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,160
When?

525
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,359
About last week.

526
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,599
Do you have his number? I'll call him.

527
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm sorry, we don't have it here.

528
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,519
How about this?

529
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,400
I'll get in touch with our executive director.

530
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,480
Okay.

531
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,759
Mr. He, this gentleman is looking for Mr. Zhang Sheng.

532
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,920
Hello, I'm looking for Zhang Sheng.

533
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,599
Last week, I talked to him about the green book bar project.

534
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,200
Oh, that.

535
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,400
Zhang Sheng isn't in charge of that.

536
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,480
He has resigned.

537
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,759
When did he resign?

538
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,759
Last Friday.

539
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,279
Well, I talked to him last Friday.

540
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,039
He has never been in charge of this project.

541
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,279
And we've already started working on it.

542
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,039
He brought a group of people to have a meeting with me last week.

543
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,079
You didn't know?

544
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,559
He and his department resigned all at once.

545
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,440
Why did he quit?

546
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,839
It's a company matter.

547
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,920
I can't tell you.

548
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,279
Then do you have his number?

549
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,440
I can't reach him.

550
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,039
I'm sorry, I don't know.

551
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,960
Please excuse me.

552
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,599
You're something.

553
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
Resigned all at once.

554
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,359
Everyone's the same.

555
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Chen Chen.

556
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,599
It's me.

557
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,960
Young Master Hou.

558
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,319
Why did you suddenly think of me?

559
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,559
It's fine if you're unreliable...

560
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,079
but you even introduced me to lousy friends.

561
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,200
What do you mean?

562
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,440
How am I not reliable?

563
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,839
I came all the way to Shenzhen.

564
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,960
Are you kidding me?

565
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,200
I can't find him. There's nothing here.

566
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,680
Wait. Explain clearly.

567
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,839
I don't understand.

568
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,119
What do you mean?

569
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,319
You introduced me to Zhang Sheng.

570
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,319
I'm at his company but he has quit his job.

571
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,160
He quit with the whole team.

572
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,559
I lost my project.

573
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,839
The company doesn't even know I submitted a proposal before.

574
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,559
My entire design proposal is with him.

575
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,519
He's not here. I can't find him. What's going on?

576
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,559
No wonder he wanted to see me that day.

577
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,759
How dare he trick me?

578
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,319
Where are you? I'll deal with it now.

579
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,359
Where are you?

580
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm at his company.

581
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,119
Okay, wait for me.

582
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,279
This is ridiculous.

583
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,759
What kind of friend is he?

584
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,440
All right.

585
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,359
This is absurd.

586
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,079
Actually,

587
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,640
what affected me the most is trust in a person.

588
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,839
I had it all planned out.

589
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,319
I was going to keep the routine.

590
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,279
Get married and live a good life.

591
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,440
That's it.

592
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,640
But after you trust someone without limitation,

593
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,079
you suddenly realize...

594
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,759
that he's not who you think he is...

595
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,279
and he has been lying to you.

596
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,519
I can't accept it at all.

597
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,240
You said you've been a bodyguard...

598
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:44,759
for seven years, right?

599
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,480
How did you manage to come so far...

600
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,640
without being defensive of others?

601
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,720
You could've just called me stupid.

602
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,400
But that's work.

603
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,359
In life,

604
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,680
you can't be defensive of all the people around you.

605
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,039
That's horrible and exhausting.

606
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:11,039
You're not a fool.

607
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,960
You're just too naive.

608
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,000
You think that...

609
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,159
everyone is kind like you.

610
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,199
What do you think? Not bad, right?

611
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,329
How can a person change so suddenly?

612
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:26,960
Think about all the time you spent...

613
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,880
when you were together.

614
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,239
Were you really blind to how he was acting?

615
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,440
You saw it but you just chose to trust him.

616
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,000
You're right.

617
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:45,840
There were things I didn't take to heart.

618
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,289
Come to think of it,

619
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,199
they really did show his personality.

620
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,000
I remember one time, a magazine asked him for an article.

621
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,119
The first payment was soon given to him.

622
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:57,639
But when the deadline came...

623
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,960
and they were rushing him,

624
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,239
he said...

625
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,840
he had already sent it out.

626
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:04,920
The editor said he didn't receive it.

627
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,440
He kept saying...

628
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,119
the editor must have gotten rid of his script...

629
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,920
and he would sue them.

630
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,079
Then he wrote a lawyer's letter demanding compensation.

631
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,239
I was quite angry then.

632
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,599
I kept telling him...

633
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,679
to fight for his rights.

634
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:23,039
I was supportive of him.

635
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,440
But later,

636
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,329
I found the article in his study.

637
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,960
It was only half-written.

638
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,329
He just left it there.

639
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:35,440
It wasn't finished at all.

640
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,440
Isn't this a ready-made example?

641
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
You saw everything.

642
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,840
But you were trapped so deep in your feelings for him...

643
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,289
that you just didn't want to face him.

644
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,079
I didn't think that far then.

645
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,769
I believed anything he said.

646
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:56,639
When you judge people in the future,

647
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,519
don't just look at how he treats you.

648
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,480
You have to see how he treats people other than you.

649
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,329
Else, one day,

650
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,719
when you violate his core interest,

651
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,239
he'll treat you like a stranger...

652
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,559
and treat you exactly how he treats outsiders.

653
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,119
You're right.

654
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,079
There's so much to learn.

655
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:29,360
I might never figure it out.

656
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:32,880
That's why people say, "You learn until you die."

657
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,679
What about you? What's going on with you?

658
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,360
Why are you still single?

659
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,679
I was almost married.

660
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,119
We went to Vegas...

661
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,440
and was going to get married there.

662
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,599
But who knew?

663
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,199
I just bought a cup of coffee...

664
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,480
when she came out and told me,

665
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,840
"Let's wait and not get married yet."

666
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,639
"Because I met my first love."

667
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,880
You must have been terribly shocked.

668
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,519
Very shocked.

669
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,360
What does she do?

670
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,599
Madam.

671
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,769
She was a policewoman.

672
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:15,840
Amazing.

673
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,599
Her first boyfriend is more amazing.

674
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,079
Is that so?

675
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,440
He was her criminal.

676
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,679
Are you serious? Stop kidding.

677
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,719
It's true.

678
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,639
He was a thief she caught on her first day as an officer.

679
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,289
When that person came out of jail,

680
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,719
they both fell in love with each other.

681
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,119
But later, he committed another crime and went back in.

682
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,289
She was disappointed in him and broke up with him.

683
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,360
Your story is really dramatic.

684
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,329
Some people...

685
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:49,679
are meant to have a dramatic life.

686
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,400
But I can't do it.

687
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,400
What I want...

688
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:58,360
is a quiet, peaceful, and mundane life.

689
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,599
Where is your girlfriend?

690
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,809
She's waiting for me at home.

691
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,000
You're here.

692
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,289
The young master called me. How can I not come?

693
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,289
Thank you.

694
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,079
What's the matter? You won't buy me a drink?

695
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm drinking water myself.

696
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,329
Why did you pick such an expensive place?

697
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:45,920
I live right next door.

698
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,039
I'm familiar with this place.

699
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,400
What's wrong?

700
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,480
Your heroine has left you?

701
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,079
Why are you asking so much?

702
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,239
That's right.

703
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
At the crucial moment,

704
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I'm the only one who stands up for you.

705
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
This is loyalty.

706
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,000
Yes, sure.

707
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,440
I know you're the most reliable.

708
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:06,519
Not exactly.

709
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,159
I came here for my own happiness.

710
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,039
After all, seeing the people around me go down...

711
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:12,199
is better than seeing my enemy's misfortune.

712
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,639
I'm so happy right now.

713
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:17,329
All right.

714
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,159
I knew you were a good girl who rubs salt on wounds.

715
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,480
I thought you flew all the way here to see me...

716
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
to give me an explanation.

717
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,559
Of course you have to demand an explanation.

718
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,480
Even if it's for me and not you,

719
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,119
I can't just sit back and watch.

720
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,639
But I'm not in the mood today.

721
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,679
Let's talk next time.

722
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,679
Fine, for whoever's sake it is,

723
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,719
I should still thank you.

724
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,440
Thank you for helping me while I'm going through a hard time.

725
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,159
Not exactly.

726
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,079
Well, I'm not helping for nothing.

727
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,519
You want my money too?

728
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,559
Your money?

729
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,519
Even the paupers are richer than you.

730
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,769
That means...

731
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,519
it's for my body.

732
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,769
And your funny soul.

733
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,880
That's what I like.

734
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,239
So direct and arrogant.

735
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:12,159
I like that...

736
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:14,559
you don't like me but you can't get rid of me.

737
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,599
Since I'm in a good mood today,

738
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:22,599
I'll grant you a wish.

739
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:24,880
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

740
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,440
You'll grant me a wish?

741
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,559
Then...

742
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,679
Wait.

743
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,159
Two whiskeys.

744
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,199
Drink slowly.

745
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,599
You'll know what you want after drinking it.

746
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Cheers.

747
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:41,769
Here.

748
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,809
Do you love her?

749
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,119
You'll have to tell me what love is...

750
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,960
before I can tell you if I love her or not.

751
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,239
I...

752
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,809
I don't have any success stories either.

753
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,639
I think love might be...

754
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,880
When you can't see her,

755
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,440
you'd miss her.

756
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,039
You'd wonder what she's doing...

757
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,039
and who she is with.

758
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,559
Perhaps it's a kind of yearning.
