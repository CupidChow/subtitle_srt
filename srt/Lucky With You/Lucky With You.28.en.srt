00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,159
(Episode 28)

4
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
This child...

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,319
is talented and successful.

6
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,239
He has a good career too.

7
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,640
He had a relationship with Shi Yi in the past too.

8
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,480
He can offer Shi Yi better working conditions.

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,799
What's important is...

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,040
it's an easy job and there's no danger.

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,319
Moreover, it can maximize Shi Yi's value.

12
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,599
The issue at hand is that...

13
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,319
Shi Yi is too kind.

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,599
I know my daughter.

15
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,000
If I tell her to leave you now,

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
she'll feel as if she has wronged you.

17
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,199
She would feel guilty.

18
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,759
I can tell...

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,159
you have feelings for Shi Yi, don't you?

20
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,199
Since you have feelings for her,

21
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,840
you should have her best interests at heart,

22
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,240
but not...

23
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,370
tie her up...

24
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
when you are not doing well.

25
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,530
I believe...

26
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,120
you're not that immoral.

27
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,560
Don't worry, Ms. Zhang.

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,199
I'll handle it. Don't worry.

29
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,080
That's very good.

30
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,840
Thank you for the help.

31
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,479
Don't mention it.

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,159
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

33
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,000
Shi Yi.

34
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,919
How are you feeling?

35
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,719
Not bad.

36
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,439
I'm in such good shape. No problem.

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,080
The doctor said I can be discharged tomorrow.

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
After getting discharged,

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,719
you need to rest and adjust.

40
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,039
Your contract expires tomorrow.

41
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,039
Hou Jue...

42
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,560
didn't come and renew the contract.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
I'm telling you.

44
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,039
I just got engaged with a really good client.

45
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,919
You don't have to work as a 24-hour guard anymore.

46
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,840
You will be in charge...

47
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,840
of hotel management works,

48
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,879
meeting reception,

49
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,039
and security.

50
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,479
As for the name of the hotel...

51
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,000
At the request of the client,

52
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,240
I shall keep it a secret.

53
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,840
But don't worry.

54
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,199
I guarantee...

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
to safeguard the deal.

56
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,039
It must be Lan Qi, right?

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,240
You got me.

58
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,879
Yes.

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,319
That's him.

60
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,050
He said...

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
he has already talked to your parents.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,170
And he will pay you...

63
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,360
twice the pay you used to get.

64
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,439
He also...

65
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,279
hired four young bodyguards...

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,360
from our company.

67
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,000
He is really sincere.

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,519
Shi Yi.

69
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,480
You have become a Gold Medal Guard now.

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,680
Finally, you can show your worth.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,279
In the meantime,

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,759
our young guards...

73
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,839
get a great chance to train.

74
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,730
Mr. Zhao.

75
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,319
The thing is,

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,639
Hou Jue is at his lowest point here.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
He needs more than protection now.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,730
He also needs support.

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,639
Anyone can work for Lan Qi.

80
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,680
As for Hou Jue,

81
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,639
I can't leave yet.

82
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,879
Hear me out, Shi Yi.

83
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,959
I...

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,319
I'm not telling you...

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
to be a selfish person.

86
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,399
Do you still remember...

87
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,639
the plane's risk prevention?

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
When the plane is in danger,

89
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,959
parents...

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,839
have to make sure they put on the oxygen mask first...

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,319
before saving their children.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,920
By any chance,

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,639
if they didn't save themselves first...

94
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,439
and choose to rescue someone else,

95
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,040
the result is...

96
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,000
they will likely die together.

97
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,680
Not being his bodyguard...

98
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,079
doesn't mean you don't support him anymore.

99
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,319
Shi Yi, remember this.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
When you're strong,

101
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,759
you'll have more strength to support him.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,120
Don't say no now.

103
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,040
Think about it.

104
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,240
Observe Hou Jue's situation.

105
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Shi Yi.

106
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,199
I'm begging you. Let me take a break.

107
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,560
I'm dying.

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,759
I'm hanging up.

109
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,759
Call me in two minutes.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm back.

111
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,079
I have sent her off.

112
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,439
Did my mom tell you anything?

113
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,319
Nothing. We were just chatting.

114
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,639
You've been gone for so long.

115
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,399
I thought my mom was saying something.

116
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,519
- It's nothing. - My mom always talks nonsense.

117
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,800
Don't take anything she said seriously.

118
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,480
There were too many people on the elevator, so I waited.

119
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,639
Your mom complimented me mostly.

120
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,680
Your mom...

121
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,120
is really touched...

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
that I take care of you.

123
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
She kept complimenting me.

124
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
She thinks that I'm taking good care of you.

125
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,519
Actually, your mom...

126
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,160
is quite concerned about you.

127
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,639
I envy you sometimes, you know?

128
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,439
Hey.

129
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,519
What's wrong?

130
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Chen Chen.

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,800
Who is it? What do you mean?

132
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,360
Is that so?

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Really?

134
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,839
That's great.

135
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm coming.

136
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm fine. I'm free.

137
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,399
Okay, see you later.

138
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,399
See you later.

139
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,639
Wait for me.

140
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,680
What? Hello?

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Who is he putting on a show with?

142
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,839
Chen Chen called...

143
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,680
and she said the project in Shenzhen...

144
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,000
is going to sign a contract with me.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Really?

146
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,040
That's great.

147
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,720
But their leader...

148
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,439
is leaving the country tomorrow.

149
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,000
I need to go now...

150
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,279
or it will be too late.

151
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,920
Then go now. Don't delay.

152
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,199
Yes.

153
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
I'm leaving now.

154
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,319
Well...

155
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,040
After that, I probably...

156
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,759
won't make it to your office in time for the signing.

157
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,399
I will have to work together with Chen Chen from now on.

158
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,360
And she doesn't get along with you.

159
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
Got it.

160
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,090
I understand.

161
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,960
Okay.

162
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,879
Will you be okay...

163
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,159
on your own?

164
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,279
What is the problem? I...

165
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,799
Chen Chen...

166
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,759
has always cared about me.

167
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,120
And she's nice to me too.

168
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,090
Well, I'll get going then.

169
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,279
Rest well.

170
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Take care.

171
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm leaving.

172
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,159
Tell Qian Qian to pick you up tomorrow.

173
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
I won't be coming.

174
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,600
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

175
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,600
I've thought about it.

176
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,090
The job that you mentioned earlier...

177
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
I accept it.

178
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,919
Come in.

179
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,450
Mr. Ma.

180
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,330
Have a seat, Mr. Zhang.

181
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,679
I can't. It's urgent.

182
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,210
Let me discuss it with you.

183
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,240
Then say it.

184
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,330
Previously, our company...

185
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,519
didn't collect some of the payment on time.

186
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,720
And then yesterday,

187
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,210
I paid for another batch of construction material.

188
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,559
The account doesn't have any money left.

189
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,000
But we still have to make...

190
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,399
a few payments.

191
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,840
Yes, that's my concern.

192
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,360
Our company has never had...

193
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,639
a capital chain rupture before.

194
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,279
If word gets out,

195
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,519
some companies will surely come to collect the money in advance.

196
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,000
We'll be under more pressure.

197
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Then...

198
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,000
take out a loan from the bank.

199
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,600
Take out a loan from the bank?

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,519
It's going to take at least five days for it to go through.

201
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,639
Some of the accounts would be frozen too.

202
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
The point is, we haven't paid back our last loan.

203
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,320
If we were to take out another loan,

204
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
the assessment will be more difficult.

205
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,759
Okay.

206
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,799
When this happened before,

207
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,159
we took some funds from Mr. Hou's personal account.

208
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,200
Then we returned it.

209
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,279
But now,

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
someone stole his account.

211
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,879
The police has frozen that account for investigation.

212
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,279
We can't do that now.

213
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,159
How about...

214
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,720
taking a private short-term loan?

215
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,519
Taking a private short-term loan?

216
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,679
That's right.

217
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,320
We have to do something.

218
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,720
That's borrowing from a loan shark.

219
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,840
It's too risky.

220
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,960
We can't decide what to do.

221
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,440
We need to discuss this with Mr. Hou.

222
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,600
No.

223
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,879
He's not feeling well lately.

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
Leave him alone.

225
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,440
You go ahead. I'll figure it out.

226
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,000
Sure, thank you for the help.

227
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,600
Unforgettable night. Congratulations to myself.

228
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,960
What are you thinking about?

229
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,279
Nothing.

230
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
Is all the procedure done?

231
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,519
- It's done. - Come on.

232
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,759
Come on.

233
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
I'll take it.

234
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,159
No, let's go.

235
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,600
Give it to me.

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Let's go.

237
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,519
Hand over the paperwork.

238
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,879
That day,

239
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,559
he insisted to come back.

240
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,120
I couldn't stop him.

241
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,840
I thought...

242
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,559
when it comes to the greater good,

243
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,360
his businessman trait comes into play.

244
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,399
That's good.

245
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,720
Good for him.

246
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,159
What a hypocrite.

247
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,440
Okay, thank you.

248
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,679
Don't forget the red envelope.

249
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,919
Come again.

250
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Hurry up.

251
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,039
Hide away. Shi Yi is coming.

252
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
Close the door.

253
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,360
Tell her I'm back in Shenzhen.

254
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,360
I went to Shenzhen. Can you remember that?

255
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,519
Sure.

256
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,159
- Did you disable the CCTV? - A long time ago.

257
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,919
Hide it. Stop drinking.

258
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,600
- Don't open the door. - Stop drinking.

259
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,559
Shi Yi.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm here to pack up.

261
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,519
I didn't see that coming.

262
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,080
It's all for the best.

263
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,919
Where's Hou Jue?

264
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,000
Did he leave?

265
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
He has left.

266
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,039
Let's go.

267
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,480
Do you need my help?

268
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,240
No, I can do it myself.

269
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm leaving.

270
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
I feel a little reluctant to leave.

271
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,840
Why do you feel reluctant?

272
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,519
He didn't feel bad leaving you behind.

273
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,799
I didn't say that I'm reluctant to leave him.

274
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,320
I mean...

275
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,440
That's enough.

276
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
You're not a bodyguard here.

277
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm not Ms. Qian either. You can tell the truth now.

278
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,240
All right.

279
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,200
That's true.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm worried about him.

281
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,440
You are worried about him,

282
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,679
but he is not worried about you.

283
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
He ran away for the greater good.

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,480
He doesn't care about you.

285
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,159
I told you on your first day as a bodyguard.

286
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,919
Don't get personal at work.

287
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,080
I know.

288
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,120
But how can living humans...

289
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,480
not have any feelings for each other?

290
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,839
In the beginning, I was annoyed by him too.

291
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,410
He behaved...

292
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,359
like a spoiled brat.

293
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,839
He's really self-centered.

294
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,039
Then I found out...

295
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,440
I misunderstood him.

296
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,170
How is that so?

297
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
He looks playful on the outside...

298
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,200
but actually is very kind on the inside.

299
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,720
Have you seen any rich guys...

300
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
volunteering in rescue work?

301
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,440
Yes.

302
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:38,319
His mom's death was actually quite a big blow to him.

303
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,279
He said...

304
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,240
when he was five,

305
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,000
he has already died with his mom.

306
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,759
He is living a second life.

307
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,200
So in every rescue,

308
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,480
he does it as if he doesn't care about his life.

309
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,480
That's the kind of person he is.

310
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,170
How could he not be pitied?

311
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,559
That's why you became attached to him.

312
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm not dating him.

313
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,599
I didn't say yes either to his confession.

314
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,759
It has just been so long.

315
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm used to seeing him every day.

316
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm used to watching him behave willfully,

317
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,650
make mistakes,

318
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,440
and throw a fit.

319
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,119
I witness him calm down bit by bit from instability...

320
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,319
and become mature.

321
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,759
I get confused at times.

322
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,410
I think...

323
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,079
it would be good...

324
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,119
to go on like this.

325
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,720
You know what?

326
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,000
When I worked with Hou Jue,

327
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,720
I was quite moved.

328
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,170
Under Chen Chen's pressure,

329
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,480
he chose to come back to you.

330
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,759
I thought that...

331
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,440
this lad is really something.

332
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
It's not just all talk.

333
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,890
He really loves you.

334
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
At the present,

335
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,890
between you and Chen Chen,

336
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,279
he chose you.

337
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,839
But between you and the future,

338
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,410
he gave you up.

339
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,680
It's good that he gave up.

340
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,680
Why should he choose me?

341
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,039
What's in it for him?

342
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,759
Except for safety.

343
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,759
He's on the rise.

344
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,170
Chen Chen is important to him.

345
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,359
I think so.

346
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,079
It's good that you two are apart now.

347
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,519
He's young.

348
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,759
He's still immature and unstable.

349
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,759
You never know if he would change...

350
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
when he has succeeded in the future.

351
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
At the time,

352
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,759
you would have become attached to him.

353
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,039
If he runs away by then,

354
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,170
you will get into trouble.

355
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,079
I know that.

356
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,720
Don't worry.

357
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,759
Do you know what I'm thinking right now?

358
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,759
What?

359
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,119
You're too small for this place.

360
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,839
Your world is out there.

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Come on.

362
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,759
Let's go and see the outside world.

363
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,079
Give it to me.

364
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,799
Give me that.

365
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,119
Put it down.

366
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,519
Come on.

367
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
(Menu)

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,279
Ying Nan.

369
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,240
I want to thank Lan Qi.

370
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,400
I wanted to treat him to a meal.

371
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,759
Shi Yi is coming too.

372
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,440
Shi Yi loves your salad.

373
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,279
But I don't know how to make it.

374
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,880
Teach me.

375
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,000
You may use any vegetable...

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,160
and any sauce.

377
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,839
Just mix it.

378
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,799
Why is it so complicated?

379
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm afraid I can't do it.

380
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,640
Or I can pick it up when you're done.

381
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,359
Salad tastes better when it's fresh.

382
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,119
Why don't you come over and make it for us?

383
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
All right then.

384
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,200
I'll leave after I'm done. I'm not joining for dinner.

385
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,920
I'll save my money then.

386
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,680
No problem.

387
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,799
Shi Yi.

388
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,119
Is there a problem with starting work the day after tomorrow?

389
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,279
No problem.

390
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,079
You have four people with you.

391
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,559
Teach and guide them well.

392
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,559
Got it.

393
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,960
It has been too hard on you for three months.

394
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,799
It so happens that the hotel has nice scenery.

395
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,720
You can relax while you work.

396
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,680
All right, enough talking. You may go for lunch now.

397
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,160
Yes.

398
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,200
I miss the food here.

399
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,920
Of course. Get going.

400
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Shi Yi.

401
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,680
Hello.

402
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm here.

403
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,279
Has the end become the beginning?

404
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,759
What?

405
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,319
I'm talking about Lan Qi.

406
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,839
You two are still in touch.

407
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
I hope...

408
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
you can rekindle that old spark.

409
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,000
An old spark can't be rekindled.

410
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,359
It would have already rekindled if it is meant to.

411
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
He's too perfect.

412
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
He wants everything to be perfect.

413
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,880
That's why it didn't work.

414
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,039
It's good to stay friends.

415
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,440
You don't know how lucky you are.

416
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,079
Really?

417
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,440
What a strange place.

418
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,839
Sir.

419
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,400
May I ask where Wu Tian Yi lives?

420
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,880
Wu Tian Yi's house is in the last alley.

421
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

422
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,319
What a dump.

423
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,519
Hold on.

424
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Ying Nan.

425
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,880
How was it? Was it easy to find?

426
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,079
This is such a shabby place.

427
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,599
Shi Yi rented this place.

428
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,359
She was going to rent a better place,

429
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
but I told her it's okay.

430
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,319
It's well-lit too.

431
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,759
There's a balcony on the second floor.

432
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,319
It's amazing.

433
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,599
The point is, it's cheap.

434
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,119
You can only get half the size somewhere else at this price.

435
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,319
It's well-organized.

436
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,279
What would you like to drink?

437
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
Just plain water.

438
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,599
You've started buying flowers.

439
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,839
No. Today...

440
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,839
Yes.

441
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,279
I've started buying flowers.

442
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,559
Have some water.

443
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,759
Don't bother.

444
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,359
It's getting late. Let's cook.

445
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,319
Take a look.

446
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
Are you ready? What do you want me to do?

447
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,480
Just make a salad.

448
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,119
I'll do everything else.

449
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,720
Then I'll just be prepared to eat.

450
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,839
Thank you.

451
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,039
I'm leaving.

452
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Mom.

453
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Shi Yi.

454
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,680
Why are you here?

455
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:02,839
Well...

456
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,359
Your dad asked me to cook.

457
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,359
I...

458
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,680
I was borrowing some green onions. Let's go.

459
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,920
What's going on?

460
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,200
Nothing. Let's eat.

461
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,960
These are all your favorites.

462
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,279
Dad, are you cooking?

463
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,240
I made your favorite coconut chicken.

464
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,640
It's my mom's favorite, right?

465
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,559
Mr. Wu, the table is done.

466
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,599
Lan Qi.

467
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,599
- You're back. - Lan Qi, why are you here?

468
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm learning how to cook from Mr. Wu.

469
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
The table is set. You may go first.

470
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
We'll handle the rest.

471
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
- All right. - Go up.

472
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,519
Thank you for your hard work.

473
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,079
The two of us will just wait for the food.

474
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,319
Come on.

475
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,880
- Lan Qi, come on. - Mom.

476
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,200
- What's next? - Why is Lan Qi here?

477
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,359
- Take this chicken to the table. - All right, let me do it.

478
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,920
Your dad is treating Lan Qi to a meal.

479
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,720
Let's go.

480
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,680
There's a lot.

481
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,759
Drink that.

482
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,160
I don't drink wine. I'll just drink this.

483
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
Come, let's eat.

484
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,720
Here, Lan Qi, have a drink.

485
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

486
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
Go on, try it.

487
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
That's enough.

488
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,599
It's okay to drink more.

489
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,599
All right.

490
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,880
Here.

491
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,079
Not bad. You have mastered his skills.

492
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,720
I think they forgot to add salt.

493
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,599
No, I did.

494
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,680
We did. You liar.

495
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,119
I'm kidding.

496
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,519
It's good. Better than me anyway.

497
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,720
Look at her.

498
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,400
I only pass down my cooking skill to men.

499
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,920
Come on.

500
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,759
You talk as if you are a master chef.

501
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,440
The boasting one.

502
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,119
Of course.

503
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,480
But I only have one disciple.

504
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,039
Master.

505
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,880
Look at these dishes.

506
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,880
I was thinking while you're cooking.

507
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,319
What exactly did I lose...

508
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,559
in the past few years?

509
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,039
Lan Qi is such a sweet talker.

510
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,920
He was complimenting the dishes, but he almost made me cry.

511
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,559
Don't cry, Mr. Wu.

512
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,839
Let's talk about something happy.

513
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,079
When we were in school,

514
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,200
did you know...

515
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
what she told our classmates?

516
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,119
She said there's something special about her family.

517
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,160
Her dad really likes to give food to her mom.

518
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,720
Regardless of where the food is,

519
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,440
even if it's right in front of her mom,

520
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,400
her dad would keep filling her mom's bowl.

521
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,359
Why don't I remember it, Shi Yi?

522
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,960
Were you really talking about your dad?

523
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,720
- Yes. - You little brat.

524
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,400
I don't remember it either.

525
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,880
Was that a story of another family?

526
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,839
All right, don't be shy.

527
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,000
My main thought is...

528
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,799
I wanted to learn from you, Mr. Wu.

529
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,039
Here.

530
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,279
Have a shrimp. It's good for your health.

531
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,079
Look at you.

532
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,079
Being admitted to the hospital is such a big deal.

533
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,720
If Mr. Wu didn't tell me,

534
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,160
until when were you planning to hide it from me?

535
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,920
It's not a big deal.

536
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,119
It's nothing. I'm fine now.

537
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,880
Everything is nothing to you.

538
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,559
Okay.

539
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,799
You're going to work at my place anyway.

540
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,599
The air is fresh and the environment is nice.

541
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,720
The work is not tiring too.

542
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,960
Can you please...

543
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,759
take a rest there to recuperate?

544
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,759
That's a good idea.

545
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,920
Lan Qi.

546
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,359
You are back.

547
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,559
When you are free,

548
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,359
just visit Mr. Wu.

549
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,400
Keep him company.

550
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,960
So he won't be lonely and sad.

551
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,400
Sure, no problem. I will come here often.

552
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Ms. Zhang.

553
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,960
How about this?

554
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,799
If it's okay with you, let's schedule a date.

555
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,480
For example, every Saturday,

556
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,240
we will come and have dinner with Mr. Wu.

557
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,079
We need to have a sense of ritual in life, right?

558
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
That's great.

559
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,039
Let alone every Saturday,

560
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,079
even if it's any other day of the week,

561
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,319
I'm fine with it.

562
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,720
Of course you are fine with it.

563
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,960
You are free seven days a week,

564
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,039
but we all have jobs.

565
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,359
Look.

566
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,160
I think I'm for it either way.

567
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,200
What about you?

568
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Mom.

569
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,480
It's nice to get together one day.

570
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,319
Let's go with the majority.

571
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,079
Yes, I think that's the plan.

572
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,160
It's decided.

573
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Let's make a drinking oath.

574
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,519
- Cheers. - Is it a done deal?

575
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,839
That's right. How nice is that?

576
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Let's drink.

577
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,319
Everyone is holding a glass.

578
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,640
It's rare that my parents don't argue when they are together.

579
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Thank you.

580
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,359
Have you ever done a puzzle?

581
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,079
No.

582
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,799
Then you must have seen someone playing it.

583
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,720
Of course.

584
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
I'm just a small piece of a puzzle.

585
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,599
However, when a piece of a puzzle is missing,

586
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,480
the entire puzzle doesn't make sense.

587
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,640
But with me,

588
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,039
the puzzle is now complete.

589
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,279
Actually, it's not that this piece of the puzzle is great.

590
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,119
It's just a coincidence that it fits.

591
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,400
You haven't changed since school.

592
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,519
You are brainy and full of ideas.

593
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,279
Do you think there's any chance of them getting back together?

594
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,880
I didn't think it was possible.

595
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:55,160
But since my mom is here today,

596
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,240
it's not impossible.

597
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,960
My mom is so proud.

598
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,319
It doesn't matter how arrogant one is.

599
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,759
They are willing to give in...

600
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,240
for their children.

601
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,200
Look at Mr. Wu today.

602
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,279
He prepared all of your mom's favorite dishes.

603
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,359
He even bought flowers.

604
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,599
You noticed that.

605
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,519
I thought I was the main character.

606
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,440
- But I was just a third wheel. - Who isn't?

607
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,319
But today was just the beginning.

608
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,640
For them,

609
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,640
we have to try harder.

610
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
I hope so.

611
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,480
That's enough.

612
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,319
- Go back to them. - Okay.

613
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,599
I've got to go. Bye.

614
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll do it, Dad.

615
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,200
It's okay.

616
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,759
Go and check on your mom.

617
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
She's not feeling well.

618
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,079
Mom, are you all right?

619
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,279
It's okay.

620
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,079
I didn't drink that much.

621
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,920
Why am I so dizzy?

622
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:14,920
I'm such a party pooper.

623
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,119
It's fine. There's no one else.

624
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,480
Did Lan Qi leave?

625
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,719
He did.

626
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,119
Shi Yi.

627
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,159
I told you that he's a good man.

628
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,960
Can't you trust me this once?

629
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,289
Mom, why don't you stay here tonight?

630
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:34,679
Let my dad take good care of you.

631
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,360
No.

632
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,079
I have to go.

633
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,679
Help me up.

634
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,519
- Are you okay? - Help me up.

635
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,199
I can do it. It's okay.

636
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,360
Your dad's pillow stinks!

637
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,599
I don't know when the last time he washed it.

638
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,329
Let's go.

639
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,400
Be careful.

640
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,079
Easy.

641
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,920
- Turn to the side. - Turn to the side.

642
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,440
Turn.

643
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,880
- Go around. - Turn.

644
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,769
My goodness.

645
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,519
My goodness.

646
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,809
His feet.

647
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:10,480
Don't you know your limit?

648
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,840
You're so drunk.

649
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,599
I'm exhausted.

650
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Monkey.

651
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,289
Boss.

652
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,119
Didn't he say he wanted to go to Shenzhen?

653
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,809
Don't ask.

654
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,119
You don't understand the adults' world.

655
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,079
If I were you,

656
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,639
I would take a photo of him...

657
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,400
and show Ms. Shi Yi how miserable he is now.

658
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,809
Yes, let's do it.

659
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,719
Stop, don't film it.

660
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,679
I'll do it.

661
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,079
You may go now.

662
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,840
All right, I'll go now.

663
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,000
Fine, I'll go.

Hello.

Are you busy right now?

I've been holding something in for a long time.

I want to talk to you.

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
Otherwise, it's going to be so uncomfortable.

674
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,159
Sometimes, it's uncomfortable to hold them in.

675
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:06,960
But it's more troublesome to say it out loud.

676
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,769
You'd better don't say it.

677
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,809
No, I think you've misunderstood.

678
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:13,159
I'm not talking about us.

679
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,519
I'm talking about Monkey.

680
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,639
After Shi Yi left,

681
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,000
his condition is terrible.

682
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,960
He is never sober.

683
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,480
He drank himself to sleep last night.

684
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,559
Today, he blacked out again.

685
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,960
Do you know how I took him to his bed?

686
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:27,480
I can't watch this.

687
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,679
If he keeps acting like this,

688
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,119
he is turning into a piece of junk.

689
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:33,639
Isn't Hou Jue going to look for Chen Chen in Shenzhen?

690
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,360
That's not true!

691
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,880
Shi Yi watched him answering a call from Chen Chen.

692
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
What's wrong?

693
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,360
Was Hou Jue acting?

694
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:47,719
Yes.

695
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,000
He's just acting.

696
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,519
I've never seen him act better.

697
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,769
He didn't go anywhere.

698
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:56,039
He stays on the second floor...

699
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,239
and drinks alone every day.

700
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,599
But he did it for Shi Yi's sake, you know?

701
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,239
He doesn't want to be a burden to her.

702
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,159
I've always wanted to tell someone,

703
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,519
but he told me not to tell anyone.

704
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,769
Then what should I do?

705
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:07,880
This is killing me.

706
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,119
I'm really going to die if I continue keeping it to myself.

707
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,809
It's really hard for me to watch him suffer.

708
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,840
I didn't mean anything by it.

709
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,769
Don't tell Shi Yi.

710
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,329
Let's respect his decision.

711
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,239
Or else,

712
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,289
he suffered for nothing.

713
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,679
I just want one less person to misunderstand him.

714
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,000
He's pretty manly.

715
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:37,960
Okay.

716
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,769
I got it.

717
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,880
I miss you.

718
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,840
The flower is so beautiful.
