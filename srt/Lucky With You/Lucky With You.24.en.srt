4
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,879
Happy birthday to you

5
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,519
Happy birthday to you

6
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,919
Happy birthday to you

7
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,719
See?

8
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,530
Hou Jue asked some people to sing for me.

9
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,530
Lan Qi is treating me to a feast tonight.

10
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,280
That's the benefit of competition.

11
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,240
It's a shame that my birthday...

12
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,039
is six months away.

13
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,879
This way.

14
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,560
- This way, please. - Thank you.

15
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,439
Drink more water.

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
At your age, you need at least eight cups of water a day.

17
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Mom, Dad.

18
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,520
- You're here. - Shi Yi.

19
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,479
I was worried you wouldn't be able to come alone.

20
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,759
I have to come.

21
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
I got a birthday cake for you.

22
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,879
It's your favorite fruit cake.

23
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,479
That's great.

24
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,039
My daughter is the best.

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Thank you.

26
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,280
It has been a while since our family got together.

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,800
You bought me clothes and dinner.

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,840
You shouldn't have.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,080
Don't mention it. It's just dinner.

30
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,680
Let's eat.

31
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,360
- Let's go, Mom. - Come on.

32
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Let's eat.

33
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,479
Happy birthday to you

34
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,120
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

35
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,400
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

36
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:47,120
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
Thank you.

38
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,520
- Happy birthday, my pretty mom. - Happy birthday.

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,719
- May you be prettier and prettier. - Happy birthday.

40
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you, baby.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
- Make a wish. - Okay.

42
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,960
- Thank you. - Good.

43
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,879
We're all here today.

44
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,120
It's Shi Yi's mom's birthday again.

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
What about this?

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,039
Let me recite a poem to liven the atmosphere.

47
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,480
- Okay. - Dad is reciting a poem again.

48
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,560
Your dad is playing the poet today.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't mess around.

50
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,399
Listen carefully.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,920
I haven't written a poem in years.

52
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,560
Your compliment would be appreciated.

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,519
Critique is not accepted though.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,759
"The day you got out of the car..."

55
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,319
"and came to me,"

56
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,279
"it was like you had thrown away the hard armor..."

57
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,120
"and turned..."

58
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,639
"into to a scaredy-cat."

59
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,800
Mom, that's you.

60
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,000
Who is a scaredy-cat?

61
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,920
"At that moment I suspected..."

62
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,560
"we were never apart,"

63
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,439
"someone must have stolen my memories."

64
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,759
"All these years while you were gone,"

65
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,639
"my life was completely blank."

66
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,720
"Every day is your birthday..."

67
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,000
"for the rest of your life."

68
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,040
"I'm going to say this every day."

69
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,279
"Happy birthday."

70
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,240
"Happy birthday,"

71
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,480
"my dream of the night."

72
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,639
Bravo.

73
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,639
Bravo.

74
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,240
Thank you.

75
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,480
You're making me sound like an old hag.

76
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,959
That's so cheesy.

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,199
Are you going to eat or not?

78
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,360
Let's take a family picture.

79
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,920
- Okay, come on. - Come on.

80
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,959
Excuse me.

81
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,519
- Take a picture for us. - Let's take a picture.

82
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,399
- Go over there. - Okay.

83
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,959
Here.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,839
Take the cake along.

85
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,240
Okay.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,319
Shi Yi, come here.

87
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,160
Mom, I'll stand here. It's fine.

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,480
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Are you hurt?

90
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,639
No.

91
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,480
You got hurt while protecting Hou Jue, right?

92
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
- What's going on? - It's just a scratch.

93
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,600
- It's okay. - If it's just a small wound,

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,759
why does it still hurt so much?

95
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,079
Listen, you can't be his bodyguard anymore.

96
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,480
Do you hear me? You can't be a bodyguard anymore.

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
- It's okay, Ms. Zhang. - Look at me.

98
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,000
I can never agree to let you do this again.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,959
Let's take a picture. Look, they're waiting for us.

100
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's take a picture.

101
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,839
- Do it quickly then. - Calm down.

102
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,839
It's done.

103
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,920
Okay.

104
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,600
- Have a seat, Ms. Zhang. - Have a seat.

105
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm telling you, Shi Yi.

106
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,319
You got hurt before this because you were an athlete.

107
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
That was for the glory of the country.

108
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,759
But this is different.

109
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,639
You're risking your life for someone else's life.

110
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,959
Why should you?

111
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,199
Are our lives beneath anyone else's?

112
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,879
- No, I... - Mom, no...

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
- Ying Nan. - Don't interrupt.

114
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,120
I thought even if Hou Jue causes trouble,

115
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,279
he would only fool around like a kid and wouldn't cross the line.

116
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,279
But look at what happened now.

117
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,920
You're badly hurt.

118
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
It has nothing to do with him.

119
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,480
Lan Qi.

120
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,079
I'm begging you.

121
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,759
You really have to help Shi Yi.

122
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,639
She can't work as a bodyguard anymore.

123
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,240
I can't bear to see my daughter...

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,360
risking her life for someone else's son.

125
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,279
It's my job, Mom.

126
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,160
I don't care. Resign right now!

127
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,800
How can I simply resign?

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
Say something!

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,680
You stop talking when it's your turn to talk.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,600
- Tell her to resign now! - Shi Yi.

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,639
If you have any situation,

132
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,279
- just tell your mom. - Don't argue with the elders.

133
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,279
It's pointless.

134
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
You must resign.

135
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,039
Shi Yi is working too hard.

136
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,450
We must stop her from working as a bodyguard.

137
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,879
Listen, Ying Nan.

138
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,720
At the time when Shi Yi was righteous and courageous,

139
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,360
you were so proud of her.

140
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,210
You stood up straight and held your head high.

141
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,330
You were quite excited back then.

142
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
When robbers were nowhere to be seen,

143
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,450
you always hoped that she'd have a chance to run into them.

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,799
How is that the same?

145
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,279
That was justice.

146
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,210
She was protecting the people and their assets.

147
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,639
Of course I would be proud and honored.

148
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,090
What's the difference?

149
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,559
Shi Yi saved Hou Jue's life.

150
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,039
Even if it's not an honor,

151
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,799
at least it's a virtue.

152
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,639
But don't you think it's too risky?

153
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,559
I'm telling you.

154
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,330
Speaking of danger,

155
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,240
it's the safest to be a bodyguard in our country.

156
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,519
We have fewer criminals here.

157
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,039
Try to do that in some other countries.

158
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,360
Now, that's really dangerous.

159
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,330
You're cold-hearted.

160
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,360
We're not compatible. I'm hanging up.

161
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,159
I'm just passionate. Yes, we don't agree on anything.

162
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,450
Get some rest.

163
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,210
Thank you.

164
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,639
Is this where you live?

165
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,120
Yes, this is it.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,559
Don't be too hard on yourself.

167
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,360
(Xing and Eight Guests)

168
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,559
No, I like it here.

169
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,960
Something has changed with the client.

170
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,450
It's just temporary.

171
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,960
All right.

172
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,720
Ms. Zhang was angry today.

173
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,440
Don't take it to heart.

174
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,799
She's just worried about you.

175
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,720
They won't listen to you at the moment.

176
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,159
Take your time.

177
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,960
I need this job.

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,200
And I love what I do.

179
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,679
I won't quit.

180
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,679
I understand.

181
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,960
You haven't changed one bit after all these years.

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
You're still passionate.

183
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,799
Actually,

184
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,279
I'm proud of you.

185
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,039
By the way,

186
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,879
don't tell my parents about Hou Jue's situation yet.

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,799
I'm afraid of causing unnecessary trouble.

188
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,919
Don't worry.

189
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,519
Does the wound still hurt?

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,039
It's okay.

191
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,080
It's recovering well.

192
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,279
Be careful.

193
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,039
Drive slowly.

194
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,519
Get some rest. Good night.

195
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,519
Bye.

196
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,000
Why are you standing here?

197
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,879
What a nice chat.

198
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,159
I didn't know you were so talkative.

199
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,600
We had a good chat indeed.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Did you talk about getting married?

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,440
Yes, we talked about that.

202
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,720
But I don't know when exactly.

203
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll let you know when it's confirmed.

204
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,919
Good night.

205
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,679
Don't be mad.

206
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Here, Mr. Ma.

207
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,960
Mr. Ma.

208
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,919
Thank you for trusting us.

209
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
From now on, whenever you need us,

210
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,600
we'll do our best in providing our security services.

211
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,159
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

212
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,519
You trained her to be a great employee.

213
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,039
It has been great working together.

214
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,000
Since our contract has been terminated,

215
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,679
that means Wu Shi Yi is free now.

216
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,159
Okay.

217
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,399
Mr. Zhao, let's sign my contract with Shi Yi quickly.

218
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,080
Why are you in such a hurry, Mr. Hou Junior?

219
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,000
Why did I bring Mr. Ma here?

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,200
It's for a seamless transition.

221
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Let's sign the contract now.

222
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,759
Mr. Hou Junior.

223
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,759
You're so thoughtful.

224
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,240
Excuse me, Mr. Zhao.

225
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,639
- Please. - I'll see myself out.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Take care.

227
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,320
After you left,

228
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,440
your dad has been in a bad mood and unwell.

229
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,559
He has aged so much.

230
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,639
It's heartbreaking.

231
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,960
Actually,

232
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,039
you're his only emotional support.

233
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,840
Go see him when you have the time.

234
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,879
Give him some comfort.

235
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Okay.

236
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,240
I know what to do.

237
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,399
Don't worry.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,919
A father and son can't be at odds forever.

239
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Let's sign the contract, Mr. Zhao.

240
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,879
Okay, I even have a pen and paper ready for you.

241
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,120
Take a look.

242
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Mr. Lan.

243
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,840
- Welcome. - Hello, Mr. Zhao.

244
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,799
I told you over the phone.

245
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,559
Once Shi Yi's contract is up,

246
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,960
I'll sign a contract with her.

247
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm here to sign the contract.

248
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,679
Okay.

249
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,720
Mr. Lan.

250
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,960
Well, you're too late.

251
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,480
I've already signed the contract with Mr. Zhao.

252
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
I'm almost done.

253
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,960
Mr. Lan, Mr. Hou Junior.

254
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,799
You're both my clients.

255
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,879
This is on me.

256
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,159
I didn't arrange your appointment well.

257
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,279
How about this?

258
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,120
Since both of you...

259
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,240
want to sign a contract with Wu Shi Yi...

260
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,039
Why don't you choose, Shi Yi?

261
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,799
I'm halfway done. What choice is there to make?

262
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,399
I think Mr. Zhao is right.

263
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,879
We'll let Shi Yi choose.

264
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Shi Yi.

265
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,039
Our group's resort is opening soon.

266
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,080
I would like you to be my security consultant...

267
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,240
to design a security plan and train the guards.

268
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,960
At least I talked to your parents about it.

269
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,519
They're totally on board.

270
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,000
I would love...

271
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,720
for you to come.

272
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,360
I'm fine. Go ahead and choose.

273
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,720
Mr. Lan.

274
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,759
Thank you for your offer.

275
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,320
That's indeed an attractive job.

276
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm sure it won't be hard to find someone better.

277
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,279
Mr. Hou.

278
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,039
I respect her decision.

279
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,559
I'll get going then, Mr. Zhao.

280
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,879
Okay, I'll walk you out.

281
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,320
You're so reliable.

282
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,279
I'll sign the contract.

283
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,079
Bidding goodbye to my old life...

284
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:37,650
and starting a new life.

285
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,519
That's right.

286
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,720
What?

287
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,519
You've resigned?

288
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,200
How will you make a living if you quit?

289
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,410
Uncle, of course she'll rely on her friend.

290
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,000
Is it the one who lent us the car and villa?

291
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,119
Let me correct that.

292
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,559
That's my boyfriend.

293
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,170
It's variable.

294
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,890
See?

295
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,440
What did I say?

296
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,359
You were in denial.

297
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,960
It's a big deal.

298
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,279
You should have told us earlier.

299
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,359
It has just been decided.

300
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,839
Come in.

301
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,279
Mom, what's wrong?

302
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,279
What are you doing?

303
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,890
You're so serious.

304
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,359
It gives me the creeps.

305
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,650
Qian Qian.

306
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,720
What does your boyfriend do for a living?

307
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,319
We've been here for so many days.

308
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,079
He didn't even show up.

309
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,759
He is a businessman.

310
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,799
He is involved in architecture.

311
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,839
It's a family business.

312
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
How old is he?

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,170
He is 55 years old.

314
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,200
That's about the same age as your dad.

315
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,440
- Is he married? - Yes.

316
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,200
No, Mom. Dad.

317
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,599
Don't misunderstand.

318
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,890
His wife passed away 20 years ago.

319
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,119
He has a son.

320
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,839
He didn't even remarry after so many years.

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He's quite sentimental.

322
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,599
What about his son?

323
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,079
Who is he with now?

324
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,319
Who else?

325
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,079
- No. - How silly.

326
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,410
I didn't mean that.

327
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,890
I just don't want Qian Qian to be a stepmom.

328
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,170
Qian Qian.

329
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,559
You quit because of him, didn't you?

330
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,359
He told me to quit.

331
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,000
He thinks the job is too hard for me.

332
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,599
He wants me to enjoy my life.

333
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,170
How old is his son?

334
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,440
He's about my age.

335
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
You should be with his son instead.

336
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,920
What are you talking about?

337
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,440
Dad, Mom.

338
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Haven't you all been wishing...

339
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,410
that I would find someone who is well-off,

340
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,119
mature, and reliable?

341
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,599
I've found him.

342
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,839
But we didn't ask you...

343
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,440
- to find someone that old. - That's right.

344
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,319
Mom, he's really nice to me.

345
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,519
I really like him.

346
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,920
Besides, I think age is not a problem for him.

347
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,039
Qian Qian.

348
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,480
I know.

349
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,119
It hasn't been easy for you out here all these years.

350
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,200
You live in a big city with a lot of expenses.

351
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,119
You have no family here.

352
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,240
You fully depend on yourself.

353
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,319
Your dad and I have been asking for a lot of money.

354
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,960
But we're not doing it for ourselves.

355
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,559
We're worried that you would spend all your money.

356
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,599
We're saving up for you.

357
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,650
It's true.

358
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,440
We didn't spend a penny.

359
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,079
I bought a house for you too.

360
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,240
We're thinking if you can't stay here any longer,

361
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,680
you'll need a place in our hometown.

362
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,410
You just have to sign the agreement.

363
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,480
Your name will be on the deed.

364
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,279
I...

365
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Mom, but...

366
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,680
Qian Qian, listen to me.

367
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,480
We should have told you earlier.

368
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,039
We shouldn't have let you bear such a heavy financial burden.

369
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,519
Qian Qian.

370
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,240
Your dad and I...

371
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,000
can't give you more.

372
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,279
All we can do is watch over your finance.

373
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,839
Your dad and I are responsible...

374
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,039
for who you have become.

375
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,079
Mom.

376
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,240
What do you mean by that?

377
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
What's wrong with me?

378
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
Qian Qian.

379
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,160
No matter how old he is,

380
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,839
I think it's still necessary for us to meet.

381
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,000
Dad, you don't understand how busy he is.

382
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,759
- He's really... - Qian Qian.

383
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Your dad and I want you...

384
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,440
to let us meet him.

385
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,440
Forget it. Don't give her a hard time.

386
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,880
If she could, she would've done so a long time ago.

387
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,680
There must be a reason why she didn't let us meet him.

388
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,640
Let's not stay here.

389
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,079
She has her reasons.

390
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,799
He's supposed to meet you.

391
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,759
Dad, Mom.

392
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,799
As your future son-in-law,

393
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,000
no matter how busy he is,

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,519
he should come and see you.

395
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
Don't worry.

396
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,799
I'll contact him now.

397
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
Massage this part a little.

398
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,640
- Yes. - Yes, use a little force.

399
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Qian Qian.

400
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,319
Is everything okay with your family?

401
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,200
Everything is okay.

402
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
That's good.

403
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,079
Tell me if you need anything.

404
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
I'll have them delivered to you.

405
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,759
We have everything.

406
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,160
Here.

407
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,680
Right here.

408
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,079
Have you been very busy lately?

409
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,160
You don't look well.

410
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,759
I have always been busy.

411
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,000
That's because you don't see me that often.

412
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,599
I work at least 360 days a year.

413
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,480
I don't have any competent helpers.

414
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,599
I have to do everything myself...

415
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:36,319
while dealing with all the monsters.

416
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,119
I don't have a choice.

417
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,279
I have to face it.

418
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,240
It's so hard to do anything.

419
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:59,319
My mom said she wants to cook for you.

420
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Did she?

421
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,039
Your mom must be a good cook.

422
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,200
She's a really good cook.

423
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,000
Are you free tomorrow?

424
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,359
Tomorrow?

425
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,799
Tomorrow...

426
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,920
Let me think about it. Tomorrow...

427
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,680
We have a meeting tomorrow afternoon.

428
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
After that,

429
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,079
Ma Yong and I...

430
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,599
are meeting a client.

431
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,720
I can't make it tomorrow.

432
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,680
What about the day after tomorrow?

433
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,119
The day after tomorrow...

434
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,400
I think I also have a meeting the day after tomorrow.

435
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,559
I don't remember very well.

436
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,839
I have to call Ma Yong and ask him.

437
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:53,480
He is the one who arranges my work schedule.

438
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,240
As the boss,

439
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,359
why are you asking him about everything?

440
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,519
He's my assistant.

441
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,200
He's doing all the work.

442
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
Then when will you meet my parents?

443
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,519
They'll go back in a couple of days.

444
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,359
It's okay.

445
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,400
We can go and visit them when I'm done with my work.

446
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,839
I'll invite them out for dinner.

447
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,359
It's okay.

448
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
My parents know your age.

449
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,519
I told them everything about you.

450
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,200
They don't mind at all.

451
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,319
Is that so?

452
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,599
They're quite open-minded.

453
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,319
You...

454
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,839
Just set up a date.

455
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,039
Let's have dinner together.

456
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Let's talk about dinner later.

457
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,160
I'll tell you once I'm done with my work.

458
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,480
There's no rush.

459
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,720
What do you mean?

460
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,240
What do you mean?

461
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Am I your girlfriend or not?

462
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,720
- Yes. - Are you ashamed?

463
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,079
What's there to be ashamed of?

464
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,920
Why won't you meet my parents then?

465
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,319
I didn't say I wouldn't meet your parents.

466
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,160
I said there's too much going on.

467
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,319
I'll go see them after this.

468
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,680
Do you want to marry me?

469
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:30,559
What?

470
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,680
I'm asking you.

471
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
Do you want to marry me?

472
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,559
Do you want to marry me?

473
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,960
Marry you?

474
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,599
I think so.

475
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,680
What do you mean?

476
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,200
What do you take me for?

477
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,640
Do you want to marry me or not?

478
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,680
Give me confirmation.

479
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,960
Qian Qian, we'll have to think about this.

480
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,920
You know what? We just met each other.

481
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,119
I don't think we know each other that well yet.

482
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,799
Even if you think we've known each other well enough,

483
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,400
let me make myself clear.

484
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
I love you.

485
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,680
But you know that I have a son.

486
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,720
Hou Jue is a grown-up.

487
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I haven't discussed this with him yet.

488
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
I don't know his stance on this.

489
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:23,559
We need to discuss this further.

490
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,759
Don't rush it.

491
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,319
What's the hurry?

492
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,319
Aren't we on good terms?

493
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,599
Isn't it great?

494
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,880
Don't you think so?

495
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,960
You never thought about marrying me.

496
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,920
I've thought about this.

497
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
We can talk about it later.

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,559
There are people here.

499
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,240
Let's talk about it in private.

500
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,839
Here.

501
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,960
Please press here.

502
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,359
Are you okay?

503
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,759
Here.

504
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,319
My back.

505
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,160
Her kick is so accurate.

506
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,759
She kicked me right in the back.

507
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,039
Are you still mad?

508
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,839
I like you a lot.

509
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,279
But I really don't want to get married.

510
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm so tired.

511
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,799
I'm exhausted from the weight of marriage.

512
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,440
But I yearn to have a marriage,

513
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,359
a home,

514
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
a husband,

515
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,960
and children.

516
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,079
I want our love to be simpler.

517
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,759
If we really love each other, we shouldn't pressure each other.

518
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,319
Just be happy when we're together.

519
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,200
When we get unhappy one day,

520
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,759
we'll just part ways in peace.

521
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
I really like you.

522
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,240
I'll do my best to be a good wife.

523
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,839
I'll show you the beauty of marriage.

524
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,559
Give me time.

525
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,559
I can change you.

526
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,720
Where are you?

527
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,000
I need to see you.

528
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Let's not see each other for a while.

529
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,880
You must have spent a lot for your parents.

530
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,119
Give me your bank account number.

531
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,279
I'll wire you the money.

532
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,880
That's enough.

533
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Get lost.

Could you make five more copies of this?

Okay, no problem.

542
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,640
Come to Hai Xing's restaurant.

546
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,000
Are you stupid?

547
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:15,480
You're not overestimating yourself.

548
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,400
You overestimate him...

and your relationship with him.

550
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,329
You're right.

551
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,079
I acted on impulse.

552
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,199
I really wanted to get married.

553
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,480
I wanted to get married so much...

554
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,119
that I thought we were on the same page.

555
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,239
I was wrong.

556
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,159
When it comes to someone we like who suits us in every aspect,

557
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,880
we can't control our feelings.

558
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,079
He doesn't want to marry me at all.

559
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,480
He just wants to have me as a kept woman.

560
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,519
I can't do that.

561
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,039
Of course you can't.

562
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,480
You have the ability to work and make money.

563
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
You're capable of making a living.

564
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,639
You don't need his support.

565
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,360
You won't be able to accept it.

566
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,440
I guess I always thought...

567
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,920
that money was very important to me.

568
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,960
But when I had to choose between money and pride,

569
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,239
I suddenly realized something.

570
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,159
What?

571
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,039
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

572
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,289
The more you want to get,

573
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,000
the more you have to sacrifice.

574
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,289
You even have to sacrifice...

575
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:34,519
what you can't afford in the first place.

576
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,960
It seems like I understand everything,

577
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,199
but why am I only able to give up...

578
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
when things go south?

579
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:48,809
That's enough.

580
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,000
Don't think too much.

581
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,920
You've figured it out now. It's not too late.

582
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,159
I'm here.

583
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,809
Don't even mention that.

584
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,639
Look at us.

00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,039
At this age,

586
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,960
I haven't been able to solve my personal problem.

587
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,440
I'm also in debt.

588
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,639
I'm stressed out just thinking about it.

589
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Think positive.

590
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,639
Hou Jue has a great saying.

591
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,769

593

I'm sharing it with you.

594
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,239

Hai Xing.

598
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,119
Why don't you go downstairs?

599
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,199
Can you not be such a coward?

600
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,440
You want to see her every day when she's not around.

601
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,809
Now that she's here, you don't have the guts to go.

602
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,289
What kind of a coward are you?

603
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,840
If you can't say something nice,

604
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,960
then don't say anything.

605
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,289
What do you know? She has a boyfriend.

606
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,639
I keep my love for her in my heart.

607
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,559
I'm keeping a distance. That's what generates beauty.

608
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,559
Does it have anything to do with you?

609
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,289
Keep it in your heart? Does she even talk to you?

610
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,769
I'll call her for you.

611
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,039
Qian Qian!

612
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,769
She left.

613
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,000
Sit down. What are you doing?

614
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,960
Gosh, let me emphasize this again.

615
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
- I just... - You're just useless.

616
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,000
I just hope she's doing well. She has a boyfriend.

617
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,199
I'll give them my blessing, okay?

618
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,559
I'm happy if she's happy.

619
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,920
I don't have to get her.

620
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,329
Love comes from the bottom of the heart.

621
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,679
You can see it, but you can't touch it.

622
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,079
She doesn't care about you at all.

623
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,079
Shi Yi.

624
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,360
Is Qian Qian unhappy?

625
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
What's wrong?

626
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,880
Hai Xing.

627
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,809
Do you have any wishes lately?

628
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,289
I just wish Qian Qian will be happy.

629
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,400
Can you stop being so pretentious?

630
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,480
Can't you talk properly?

631
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,920
Be a man.

632
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,599
Yes, tell us how you really feel.

633
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,159
I hope she'll break up with him immediately.

634
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,360
- Is that possible? - That's impossible.

635
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Congratulations.

636
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,239
Your wish has come true.

637
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,639
What?

638
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,519
They broke up.

639
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,199
I'm not gloating.

640
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,289
But it's a good thing.

641
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,920
Qian Qian will be happy this way.

642
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,039
That man is a jerk.

643
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,639
She should have left him sooner.

644
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,920
Why do I feel like you know who that person is?

645
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,400
How would I know who it is?

646
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,329
Aren't jerks all the same?

647
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:40,119
Jerks like him should be executed right away.

648
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,960
Even if she has broken up with him,

649
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,039
she didn't say she would give you a chance.

650
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,119
What are you so happy about?

651
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,679
It's none of your business.

652
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
He was looking at her from the window...

653
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
because he was too afraid to go down there.

654
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,480
I'm so annoyed by that.

655
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,559
It's embarrassing.

656
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,000
- What do you know? - You're pathetic.

657
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,719
She is single and that means I stand a chance.

658
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,289
She is single and that means I stand a chance.

659
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,519
What is this?

660
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,920
What did I tell all of you?

661
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,599
What I want...

662
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,199
is the design that surpasses the first two designs.

663
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,769
What on earth is this?

664
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:24,000
I want something from the soul.

665
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,239
What is this called?

666
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,920
This is tweaking.

667
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,079
Anyone can do that.

668
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:30,159
I could get it done overnight by tweaking it.

669
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,809
What do you do for a living?

670
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Mr. Hou.

671
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,360
If we go all-out, the main structure will be affected.

672
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,809
Even if we push them further,

673
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:42,960
this is all they can manage.

674
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,719
Among the designers in the company now,

675
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,199
none of them is good at structuring.

676
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
So...

677
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,289
making them design for the proposal of the international project...

678
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,159
is too difficult.

679
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,239
Didn't I tell you?

680
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,809
If we don't have the talent in the company,

681
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,719
find someone out there who can do it.

682
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,329
We've already looked.

683
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:05,719
We've taken it very seriously.

684
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,639
A lot of people heard that Bao Xiao Han resigned,

685
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,679
so they don't want to come here.

686
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
And...

687
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
And what?

688
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,039
The best deal that we are offering...

689
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,400
is not as much as what they're getting paid right now.

690
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,809
Designers, my foot.

691
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,880
It's an international project.

692
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,559
It's a great opportunity for them.

693
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,639
They don't appreciate it.

694
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,239
They only care about money.

695
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,809
This is so silly.

696
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,920
So what now?

697
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,519
We need to find a solution.

698
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,440
The quickest way...

699
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,440
is to bring Bao Xiao Han and Hou Jue back.

700
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,719
Bring at least one of them back.

701
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Bao Xiao Han's ability is unbeatable...

702
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,159
in the design team.

703
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,239
Hou Jue's structuring strength...

704
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:12,960
is also quite outstanding.

705
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,809
Mr. Hou.

706
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,840
I think...

707
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,289
it's better to bring Xiao Han back.

708
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,119
Firstly,

709
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:41,159
the design problem can be solved immediately.

710
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,769
It will work instantly.

711
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,039
Secondly,

712
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,039
it's to prevent him...

713
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,289
from getting headhunted by other companies.

714
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,769
That would be a bigger threat.

715
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,840
What do you think?
