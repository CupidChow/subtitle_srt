=Episode 21=

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,360
I asked, and he admitted

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,600
that he killed Xiao Ran.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,320
I thank you on Xiao Ran's behalf.

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,600
It likely wasn't his choice.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
I know.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,800
But I need to hear him say it.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
Let me go question him.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,440
I'll handle it.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,260
It's inconvenient for you.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,800
Only I

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
have the right.

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,680
Was killing Xiao Ran

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,000
your idea

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,280
or Wang Mingcheng's?

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,680
You're one tough one,

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
still breathing till now.

27
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Answer my question.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
It was my call.

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Your call?

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,120
Why? Why?

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,240
You disabled man.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,480
I just wanted to kill her.

33
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,040
There was no reason.

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,280
If I'd known then,

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
I'd have killed you right there

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
the first time I saw you.

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
What's your name?

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,720
Han Yu.

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
You little brat,

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,600
full of nasty tricks.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
You're kind of like me.

42
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,120
Stick with me.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,240
From now on, you're Wang Yu.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
Stop right there.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,320
Stop hitting him.

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,000
What is he even worth?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
He's as weak as a chick.

48
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,920
I don't care.
If you want to hit him, hit me, too.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,880
If it's not done by dark,

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,960
you'll be fed to the dogs.

51
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
Why?

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,240
You're the weakest.

53
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,960
Why would Xiao Ran choose you?

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,840
I can't figure it out.

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
She had it coming.

56
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,040
I stole this from the kitchen for you.

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,280
Thanks.

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
This was my dad's keepsake.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm giving it to you.

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
If anyone picks on you again,

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,960
use this to protect yourself.

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,440
Just because you were missing an arm,

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
you thought

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,480
the whole world owed you.

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,760
Even Godfather spoiled you

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,720
and hired a master

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,480
to teach you about drug making.

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,000
We fought for our lives out there.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
Among eleven brothers,

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,360
I'm the only one left.

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,200
You...

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,840
Why was it you?

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,880
Why?

74
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,840
You know what?

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,800
I could've let her go,

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,880
but I chose to end her life.

77
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,280
You wanted to spare Xiao Ran?

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,180
Do you even deserve that?

79
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,420
I'm running out of patience.

80
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,600
Was it Wang Mingcheng's order?

81
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
He wanted to keep me here,

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
so he chose to kill Xiao Ran?

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,320
Tell me. I want the truth now.

84
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,200
Come on.

85
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,450
Come on then.

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
I want you to tell me.

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
Tell me.

88
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Tell me now.

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,520
Tell me.

90
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
Tell me.

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,800
Tell me.

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
Yes.

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,560
Yes.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400
I wanted to save her.

95
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,480
But I dared not defy Godfather.

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,240
End this for me.

97
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,780
Everything that happened

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,640
to Xiao Ran,

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
you, and me

100
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,920
was because of Wang Mingcheng.

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,320
When you hit the road,

102
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,560
take it slow

103
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
and wait for him.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,880
Got it?

105
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
Same as we thought.

106
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,560
Then I'll find a way

107
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,960
to lure Wang Mingcheng out.

108
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
You let Han Xu go

109
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
and tricked Ma here.

110
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Going back means death.

111
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Even if I die,

112
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,600
I'd still take a bite out of him.

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
You like Xiao Ran, too,

114
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
right?

115
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,000
I once wanted to kill you.

116
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,760
But then I thought

117
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
it wouldn't be my turn anyhow.

118
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,800
If you want to avenge her,

119
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
do as I say.

120
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,960
I have a plan.

121
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
You two.

122
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,400
Given your ties to Chief Ma,

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,020
there's a need

124
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,420
to send you to the Inspection Unit

125
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
for a review.

126
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,680
This time,

127
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,560
I've reported on your behalf.

128
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,640
Take them away.

129
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,920
- Move.
- Let's go.

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
Hello?

131
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,240
Director Zhou has passed away.

132
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,760
Songtai gave his life.

133
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
We now think

134
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,400
Chief Ma is one of them.

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,440
It depends on whether Han Xu
can recall anything.

136
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,720
Why don't you come over?

137
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,640
Let's discuss our next move.

138
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,500
The lighthouse in your hometown

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
is where it all began.

140
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,200
The lighthouse?

141
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,660
(Han Xu: 1st)

142
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,000
(Han Yu: 2nd)

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Han Yu, I came in first.

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,360
You're in second place.

145
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Next time, I'll be first.

146
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,740
(Han Xu: 1st)

147
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Xu.

148
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
Xu.

149
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,520
Xu.

150
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,200
Help me! Please help me!

151
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Xu, save me! Please!

152
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,620
(M City Central Hospital,
B-ultrasound report)

153
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Hello? Doctor Chen, I remember now.

154
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
I know the whole truth.

155
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,500
I have a younger brother.

156
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,440
His name's Han Yu.

157
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
He's out for revenge on me.

158
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
He killed Xiao Ran, An Shaocong,

159
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
and Wu.

160
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,880
Everything was his doing.

161
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,720
I have proof.

162
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
Be careful; he might come after you.

163
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,360
Hello?

164
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,200
Han Xu.

165
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
My dear brother.

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,760
