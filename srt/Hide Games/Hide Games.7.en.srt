00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,980
Xu.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,340
Why are you here?

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,580
Where is this place?

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,160
Come with me, I've got a surprise for you.

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,780
Xu, you're back.

16
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,700
What's going on?

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,400
Why does everyone seem to know me?

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,700
Guess you're just popular.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,180
Let's go.

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,940
Don't be scared, just come with me.

21
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,500
Let's go.

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,190
Come on, let's move.

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,100
It's alright.

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,140
Xu, wait for me a sec.

25
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,540
Xu, I saved this money in secret.

26
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,120
It's enough for us to get by.

27
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,860
When do we make our escape?

28
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,540
I don't know what's going on,

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,660
but I feel like

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,820
we should leave now.

31
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,820
Let's go.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,660
Xu.

33
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,280
I know a shortcut we can use to get out.

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,220
Follow me.

35
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,220
Watch your step.

36
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,780
Who's there?

37
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,660
Don't move.

38
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,380
Xu!

39
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,020
Wang Mingcheng?

40
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,760
You should call me dad.

41
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,180
Calling me by name...

42
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,620
That's a bit rude, isn't it?

43
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,300
I knew it.

44
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,220
That Xiao Ran you mentioned

45
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,620
is really no good.

46
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,580
How about I find you someone else?

47
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,500
No.

48
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,420
Don't hurt her.

49
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,180
It's all my fault.

50
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,460
Punish me.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,340
Just don't hurt her.

52
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,810
Good son.

53
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,220
How could I bear to punish you?

54
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
You're my lucky charm, after all.

55
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,220
But

56
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,700
I'll let this slide, just once.

57
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,500
Don't let it happen again.

58
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,660
I need water.

59
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,940
Get the water.

60
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,300
It's been ages

61
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,100
since we used dialect.

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,260
Thanks.

63
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,220
How's it going?

64
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,940
Did anything come to mind?

65
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,580
Yeah.

66
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,940
Any leads about 405?

67
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,860
I'll let this slide, just once.

68
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,180
Don't let it happen again.

69
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,940
No.

70
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
Nothing came back to me.

71
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,260
My memory's just blank.

72
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,840
It's almost all darkness.

73
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,580
So, Dr. Chen,

74
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,540
this method isn't working much.

75
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,860
We don't have any better ideas right now.

76
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,620
Well,

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,700
you can rest a bit.

78
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,740
Then we'll try again.

79
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,580
It's chaos out there already.

80
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,660
We need to find another time and chance.

81
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,620
All the officers have been sent out

82
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,380
to searching for Han Xu.

83
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,140
I'm worried

84
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,380
they'll find this place.

85
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,580
I have a way

86
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,980
to buy us some time.

87
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,520
What are you thinking?

88
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,020
Everything you did today

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,580
will make them suspicious.

90
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,260
They might not trust you.

91
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,860
Hello, this is Chen Yasin.

92
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,420
Han Xu has kidnapped me.

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,340
I escaped when he wasn't looking.

94
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,300
It seems like I'm in the village,

95
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,500
North District.

96
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,100
I don't know the exact spot.

97
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,500
Please come get me.

98
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,780
There's no time for another hypnosis.

99
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,960
How about this,

100
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,620
just contact me when you have time.

101
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,380
Don't lose hope.

102
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,210
As long as we're together,

103
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,140
we can help you get your memory back.

104
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,020
Dr. Chen,

105
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,940
you don't need to.

106
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
I know what I'm doing.

107
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,220
This Dr. Chen seems

108
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,940
interested in you.

109
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,500
Stop making stuff up.

110
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,260
Go look into it.

111
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,900
Into what?

112
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,620
We don't have any leads right now.

113
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
Check out anything related to 405.

114
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,620
Maybe

115
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,630
you missed something.

116
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,540
Alright.

117
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,640
I'll take another look.

118
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,820
And you,

119
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,780
for now,

120
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,340
just stay here.

121
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,340
Lie low for a while.

122
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,220
I'll contact you via this phone.

123
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,420
I'll check in with updates every day.

124
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
Remember this,

125
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,540
hide if you can.

126
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,700
If anything feels off,

127
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
run right away.

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,980
That car outside

129
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,580
is for you to use.

130
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,260
Be careful.

131
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,020
There's no trace of semen DNA.

132
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,060
You can't visit the scene.

133
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,500
Your head

134
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,780
really did take a bad hit.

135
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
Xu.

136
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,540
(Hell Is Never Empty)

137
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,220
(Every action has its cause.)

138
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,220
(The world isn't what it seems.)

139
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,060
(Countless forms of truth.)

140
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,980
(Emptiness within true emptiness.)

141
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,980
(Hell Is Never Empty)

142
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,340
Why don't you bow, guest?

143
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,100
Master,

144
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,620
I know

145
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
the rules here,

146
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,780
but in your temple,

147
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,380
you honor Rakshasa.

148
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,660
So I can't bow.

149
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,980
You're only seeing the surface.

150
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,340
If your heart holds darkness,

151
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,940
then you worship Rakshasa.

152
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,060
If your heart holds light,

153
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,940
then you worship Buddha.

154
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,340
Master,

155
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,540
between Buddha and Rakshasa,

156
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,060
which one is true?

157
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
Which one is false?

158
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,660
The Buddha is you,

159
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,020
the Rakshasa is you;

160
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,380
thirst

161
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,660
and hunger

162
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,540
are you as well.

163
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,660
(Wu)

164
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,380
If you're feeling restless,

165
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,060
maybe take a walk outside.

166
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,140
Master,

167
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm not sure if I'll ever find the truth.

168
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,020
I believe you're truly fortunate.

169
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,660
Just head out and see.

170
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,220
Things will turn around soon.

171
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,260
Thank you, Master.

172
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,620
Why is it you?

173
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,540
Who sent you here?

174
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,560
It's fine if you don't say.

175
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,410
Han Xu!

176
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,460
