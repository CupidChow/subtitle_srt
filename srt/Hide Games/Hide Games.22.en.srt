11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,080
Don't hurt her.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
I know who you are now.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,760
It's my fault.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,240
Where are you?

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
I'll go and see you.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,160
Let's end this for good.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
Alright.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,840
The abandoned building in the old town.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,960
The place where you fell.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,020
I'll be waiting there.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,200
Remember.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,420
You have just one hour.

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,870
Who is this?

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,160
My brother's taken Doctor Chen.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,360
He's in the old town.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,240
You remember now?

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,320
Didn't your brother...

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,370
Get your people there now.

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,260
Or it'll be too late.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,760
Sure, I'm heading there now.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
Before I arrive,

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,180
don't do anything rash.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello?

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Right on time this time.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Cut the talk; where are you?

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Look up.

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,560
No need to rush.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Han Yu.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,520
I know you're Han Yu.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Let her go.

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,980
You've got the wrong person.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Disappointed?

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,040
He still doesn't remember you.

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm telling you the truth.

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
I haven't seen her in over a decade.

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,160
She's just my doctor.

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
Let her go. You've got the wrong one.

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
What a shame.

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,760
She's the one you loved most.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,560
Too bad she's of no use now.

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,160
It doesn't matter anymore.

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
Don't move.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,320
Move closer, and she'll be gone.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,800
You'd better hold on to me.

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,040
Don't you lose me.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,640
Hold on to me.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,640
Don't you lose me.

58
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,840
I've decided.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,840
Her name's Nuo.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,560
From now on, take care of us.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Don't you lose us.

62
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,160
Why does it feel like they all know me?

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,050
Morning, ma'am.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,040
Xu, you're back.

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Let's go.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,780
Xu, I've been saving this money
in secret.

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
It should be enough for us to get by.

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,200
Let's leave now.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,660
Xu.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
I know a path we can take to leave.

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,280
Come with me.

72
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,600
Xiao Ran

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
is nothing but trouble.

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
This is all my fault.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,920
Punish me if you want; don't hurt her.

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't hurt her.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,220
You have to trust yourself.

78
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,780
(Two months ago)

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Let my wife go.

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,240
If you have a problem,
take it out on me.

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
Don't move.

82
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,320
What do you want?

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Still as selfish as ever.

84
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
What does Xiao Ran's death

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
even mean to you?

86
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,320
Xiao Ran and An Shaocong's deaths

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,940
were likely Wang Mingcheng's doing.

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
That's nonsense.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
I'm the one who killed An Shaocong.

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
When I got there, Xiao Ran was dead.

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,120
An Shaocong killed Xiao Ran.

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
That's impossible.

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,380
Xiao Ran was always our informant.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,300
What do you even know?

95
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
I'm asking you.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,780
What do you even know?

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,320
You know nothing at all.

98
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,080
Why would she be your informant?

99
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,360
I'm asking you.

100
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Why would she be your informant?

101
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,280
She did it for me.

102
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,760
Son.

103
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,440
I got all this for you.

104
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,120
How is it?

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
That's enough.

106
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
I can pull it off.

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
Good.

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
You're so smart.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,960
You stay here and focus

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,200
on getting that refined formula,

111
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,360
and we'll live a wealthy life.

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Godfather.

113
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
I can't finish the experiment alone.

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,360
Where's the helper I asked for?

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,160
Come in.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,440
Why are you doing this?

117
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,960
Why keep sabotaging my experiment?

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,660
Are you afraid
that once I get the formula,

119
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll be valued more,

120
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
and then I'll treat you

121
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
however I want?

122
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,400
I knew you looked down on me.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Xiao Ran, listen to me.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,640
If you don't like me,

125
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
you can just say it.

126
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,720
You don't need to...

127
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,360
Xiao Ran.

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,400
Xu.

129
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
When I was little,

130
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
our village was taken over by dealers.

131
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,400
My parents were killed by them.

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,320
I hate them.

133
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,720
I hate those drugs.

134
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
But you're different.

135
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
You're a genius.

136
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,080
Once you create this refined formula,

137
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
more families will suffer,

138
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,360
just like mine did.

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,560
I like you.

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,120
But I can't let you succeed.

141
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,560
If I don't make it,

142
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
we're both done for.

143
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,760
Let's just run.

144
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,000
We can't run.

145
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,360
Run where?

146
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,280
I've been running my whole life.

147
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,440
Never once made it out.

148
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,080
I can't escape this sea of poppies.

149
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
Listen to me.

150
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,760
These things

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,640
are all we have to bargain with.

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
Once I crack this formula,

153
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
we can buy our freedom for life.

154
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,480
You have to trust me.

155
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,760
When the Formula works,

156
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,300
I'll never touch this stuff again.

157
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,400
- No.
- Trust me on this.

158
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,440
- No.
- Trust me on this.

159
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,480
You can't keep doing this.

160
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,360
Trust me.

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
No.

162
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,360
Xu.

163
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't want to touch drugs either.

164
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,640
Do you think I want this?

165
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm disabled.

166
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,980
I know you look down on me.

167
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,280
This is the only way
I feel worth something.

168
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,800
Why do I do it?

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Because I want freedom.

170
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,200
I want you to be free, too.

171
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,760
So, you like Xiao Ran.

172
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,840
It's not just liking her.

173
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,840
I love her.

174
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,080
I was so close.

175
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,880
One step away from taking her far away

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,860
to live somewhere quiet and peaceful.

177
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,040
Just one more step.

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,880
Then I met you.

179
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
You ruined everything, you know?

180
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,440
Hurry! Han Xu's coming with people.

181
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,600
It's a covert operation.

182
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,640
Alright, got it.

183
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,360
What happened, Godfather?

184
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,520
The police are here. Go now!

185
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,080
What about Xiao Ran?

186
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,680
I'll have someone protect her. Go!

187
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,040
No, I have to save her!

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
Wang Yu!

189
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,160
Wang Yu!

190
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,600
Hurry up!

191
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Hurry!

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,160
Got it.

193
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll wire you the money.

194
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,640
Where are they?

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Well?

196
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,680
Any news on Xiao Ran?

197
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,480
The An guy

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,560
is after her beauty.

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
During the police raid,

200
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
he kidnapped Xiao Ran.

201
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,480
I've let you down

202
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,600
on this.

203
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
The priority now

204
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,280
is for you to write down the formula,

205
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,160
so we can make a comeback.

206
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,280
Where did they take Xiao Ran?

207
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,160
The eastern suburbs.

208
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,920
It's already come to this.

209
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,640
Give me the formula first.

210
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,320
I'll give you the formula.

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,440
But not now.

212
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,360
Also,

213
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
I have a term to trade.

214
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
Help me track down someone.

215
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,400
His name's Han Xu.

216
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,120
He looks exactly like me.

217
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
Who is he?

218
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Why do you need him?

219
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,380
Revenge.

220
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,720
You ruined me once.

221
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,920
Now, you've ruined me again.

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,270
Every time I try

223
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
to live quietly and peacefully,

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
you tear my life apart.

225
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,880
But that's fine.

226
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,080
You ruined me,

227
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,240
and I'll ruin you too.

228
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,840
Do you know what I'm gonna do next?

229
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
I'm going to kill you.

230
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,080
I'll kill your Yasin too.

231
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,200
Also,

232
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,040
I'm making Nuo

233
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
my daughter,

234
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,580
so she can suffer

235
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,750
every bit of pain

236
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,680
I've been through.

237
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,320
How's that?

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,280
Not a chance.

239
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
Yasin,

240
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
Nuo,

241
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,710
Dad, my teacher praised me today.

243
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Dad, you're finally back.

244
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,880
Look.

245
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
Thanks, Dad.

246
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,520
Good girl.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,920
Glad you like it.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,640
Seems you really like this pendant.

249
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
My dad gave it to me.

250
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I've always treated it as my amulet.

251
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,960
Now, I want you to have it.

252
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,760
When we meet again,

253
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
you can give it back to me.

254
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,220
(Memory recovery: 100%)

255
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,500
(The brothers' face-off
unlocks his memory.)
