I'll trust you one more time.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,680
(Insider cop)
It was this number.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,160
If you make the right choice,

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,840
everything will come to light.

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,800
If you choose wrong,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,520
there's no turning back.

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,040
All these checks
are ruining my business.

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,560
I live in the last room; I lost my key.

19
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,920
You lost the key?

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,640
Why are you still alive?

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,420
(Reward wanted notice)

22
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,440
I'll grab my stuff and go.

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,520
Hurry up; we're almost there.

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,520
Han Xu, wait for me.

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
As you requested, you're moved

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,320
(Grooming)
to the Narcotics Unit.

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,800
I, Han Xu, swear

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,280
to wipe out all drugs.

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,160
How does it feel to be left behind?

30
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,120
I'll tell you the whole truth.

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,200
It's just photoshopping.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,100
She was not your wife.

33
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,820
You actually think
Xiao Ran was your wife?

34
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,120
Did the amnesia drive you crazy?

35
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,560
- You don't even deserve her.
- Xu.

36
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Han Xu.

37
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,300
Who are you?

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm you.

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,060
Go back.

40
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,600
The lighthouse in your hometown

41
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,100
is where it all began.

42
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,060
The lighthouse?

43
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,820
You're sure it's Han Xu?

44
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,500
It's definitely him.

45
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,740
Get over here now.

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,540
Fortune Hotel.

47
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,700
I'm on my way.

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,340
Make sure you keep him there.

49
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,420
And my bonus?

50
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,900
Dispatch just sent an update.

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,260
They found Han Xu.

52
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,020
You two go with Chief Ma now.

53
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,180
- Okay.
- Okay.

54
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,740
Nice burn.

55
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,780
You'd better burn it all

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,180
and pretend nothing ever happened

57
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,460
to keep your head buried

58
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,580
and stay the coward you are.

59
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,620
Shut up.

60
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,300
You're just in my head.

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,480
Just a shadow, nothing more.

62
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,020
You're not real.

63
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,340
You think
I'll believe you exist like this?

64
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,660
But I'm already here.

65
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,180
Hello?

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
Why aren't you here yet?

67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,660
Keep him there; we're almost there.

68
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,180
Check out.

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
Stay one more night.

70
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,420
It's our anniversary today.

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,620
It's free.

72
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,940
You should kill her.

73
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,960
Deduct it from the room fee.

74
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,060
Chief Han.

75
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,780
Does stealing your own car

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
count as a crime?

77
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,320
Don't you feel something's missing?

78
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,380
Even the photos are fake.

79
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,000
Then what's actually real?

80
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,620
Where are you going?

81
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,720
I'm going to get rid of you.

82
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,040
Got anything to drink?

83
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,940
I'm glad

84
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,060
that you came to me.

85
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,840
Why's the water fountain not dripping?

86
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,160
Yeah.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,100
It's been fixed lately.

88
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,700
You've been using these to hypnotize me.

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,180
Isn't that so?

90
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,260
Every time I hypnotize you,

91
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,780
I've always told you beforehand.

92
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm not talking
about just those two times.

93
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,780
I mean your whole plan.

94
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,200
These days, I've been through a lot.

95
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,000
And I've figured it all out.

96
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,180
The drops from the water fountain,

97
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,600
the neon light at my place,

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,540
and the bulb in the interrogation room

99
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,540
are all tools

100
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,260
you used to hypnotize me, right?

101
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,820
When I lost my memory,

102
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,180
you were putting on an act around me.

103
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
I kept trying to make sense of it,

104
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,860
but there are still so many things

105
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,800
I just can't figure out.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,860
From the very start,

107
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,180
you hypnotized me.

108
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,980
I've been trapped in a huge trance.

109
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,220
Right?

110
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,740
Yes.

111
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,300
It's called lucid hypnosis.

112
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
The goal

113
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,620
was to help you get your memory back.

114
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,500
But the moment you stopped trusting me,

115
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,940
the plan had already failed.

116
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,600
Everything you went through after that

117
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,900
wasn't part of the plan.

118
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Come on.

119
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,680
What exactly is in my memory?

120
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
Why did you have such a huge plan?

121
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,740
Even Wang Mingcheng is trying to use me.

122
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,380
They're after the drug refined formula.

123
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,400
But all I want is for you to come back.

124
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,260
How so?

125
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,540
I can't tell you.

126
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,340
Because your memory hasn't returned.

127
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,780
You've been through too much too fast.

128
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,140
Your brain
is locking away those memories

129
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,060
deep in your mind.

130
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
If I told you

131
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,500
everything I know,

132
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,820
your mind could break from it.

133
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,460
It might even split apart.

134
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,020
The damage would be beyond repair.

135
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,480
So you have

136
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,860
to remember everything on your own.

137
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,700
How do you know

138
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,020
I haven't gotten my memory back?

139
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,860
Alright.

140
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,260
Look at me.

141
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
I just know it.

142
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,580
Look at you.

143
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,180
You made that young girl cry.

144
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,780
What's it to you?

145
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,140
What's wrong?

146
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,420
What did you see?

147
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
Another me.

148
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,260
Right beside you.

149
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,780
Take a break first.

150
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,900
Take a rest.

151
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,050
Rest first.

152
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,380
Don't think about anything, okay?

153
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,940
See?

154
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,340
I told you to be a coward.

155
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,100
Shut up.

156
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
Technically speaking,

157
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,740
you lied to me.

158
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,800
I shouldn't have come here.

159
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,180
But I still did.

160
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,820
Do you know why?

161
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,780
Memories can fool you.

162
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,000
But feelings never lie.

163
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,260
My feelings tell me

164
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,380
you can help me.

165
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,100
You're someone I can count on.

166
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
Come on.

167
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,780
What could she possibly do?

168
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,020
Shut up.

169
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,300
Keep your voice down.

170
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,420
She's right here.

171
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,380
Don't scare her off.

172
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,540
Can you stop?

173
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,140
I have an idea.

174
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,220
