11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,320
- What's wrong?
- We found this.

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,120
They say Wang Yu took Wang Mingcheng.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,800
Look at the style and this photo.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,000
Could Wang Yu be avenging Xiao Ran?

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,880
His revenge isn't over yet.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,160
He lured us here on purpose.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,480
His plan is still in motion.

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,400
Nuo and Yasin are in danger.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,420
Yasin.

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Sorry about this.

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,040
I need my niece for a moment.

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,480
No, no.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
What?

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,960
- No.
- I can't hear you.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,920
- Louder.
- No.

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,440
No.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
Go away.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,920
- Please.
- Or I'll kill her now.

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,560
No, no.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,400
What did you say?

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,760
Let go.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,040
No!

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,560
Sorry, I'm late.

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't worry.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Nuo will be fine.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
He's after me.

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,080
I never should've let go.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Calm down.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,440
- Think.
- I shouldn't have let go.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,600
Did Wang Yu act strangely at all?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,940
I shouldn't have let go.

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,680
Think about it.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,560
The pendant.

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,880
The pendant...

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
Where is it?

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
Look.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
It's not the formula.

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,560
He left it on purpose.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,100
(Where it began is where it ends.)

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,110
You wait here.

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
Look after Yasin.

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,080
- I'll pick up Nuo.
- No.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,660
- Let's go together.
- I'll call backup.

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
No.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,920
We're not sure

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,880
how Wang Yu's doing.

57
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,320
The fewer people there are,
the safer Nuo is.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,860
At least let me go with you.

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
Alright, you take care of her.

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,600
Don't worry.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,280
Hand me the gun.

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,560
Wait for me here.

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
Be careful.

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
Dad.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
Dad, help me!

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,040
Dad.

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,570
Dad, please save me!

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Hey, Xu.

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,000
Long time no see.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,400
I owe you this.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
Tell me.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,660
What do you want from me?

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,760
Can you afford that?

74
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,880
- No!
- Dad!

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
Dad.

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,360
Dad, help me!

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,840
- Dad!
- Nuo, don't move!

78
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm here to save you.

79
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
Don't you find

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,360
this familiar?

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
We went through the same thing.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,080
Remember?

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,760
I begged you the same way.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Remember?

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
But you forgot about me.

86
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,680
I remember now.

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Isn't this what you want?

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,440
Good.

89
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080
Very good.

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,960
Pain while aware

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
is the truest suffering.

92
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,680
Xu.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
You played dumb for two months

94
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,360
and wasted a lot of my time.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
This time,

96
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,560
I'm warning you again.

97
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Don't try any petty tricks.

98
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,280
I won't repeat the mistake

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
from two months ago.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
But I can feel it.

101
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
You've changed.

102
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,160
You asked Boss Jiu to save me.

103
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
That means in your heart,

104
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm still your brother.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
You're not my brother.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
Boss Jiu acted on his own.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,100
I'd rather see you gone.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,040
You know that?

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,100
Why go through all the trouble?

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,520
If Wang Mingcheng has Han Xu use drugs,

111
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
just let him.

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,320
Why tell me

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
to watch over him?

114
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,880
Our collaboration

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,280
is based on you listening to me, right?

116
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,680
You're quite interesting,

117
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
scheming to take him down

118
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,680
while wanting me to protect him.

119
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,280
Only I can hurt him.

120
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,500
Wang Mingcheng isn't worthy.

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
I know what kind of man

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
Boss Jiu is.

123
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
Why did he save me?

124
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,680
Han Yu.

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,360
Let Nuo go.

126
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,700
You can do whatever you want to me.

127
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,720
Think about Xiao Ran.

128
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,520
She wouldn't want you
to hurt the innocent.

129
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,740
Don't bring up Xiao Ran to me.

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,880
Do you really know what kind of man

131
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
she wanted me to be?

132
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,360
This letter

133
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,020
is from Xiao Ran to you.

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,880
I found it among An Shaocong's things.

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,680
See for yourself.

136
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,340
This really is her handwriting.

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Xu.

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,960
You know what?

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,520
Before I met you,

140
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
there wasn't a ray of light in my life.

141
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
But your appearance

142
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,440
changed everything.

143
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,930
You were so vulnerable

144
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,760
but also so resilient.

145
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
You were like a faint light,

146
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,120
making me instinctively want
to protect you.

147
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,640
So, I couldn't allow my light

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,720
to be pulled into darkness
step by step by Wang Mingcheng.

149
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,360
I don't want you
to complete the formula,

150
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,520
even if it's for me.

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,760
I don't want you to bear

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,560
the countless sins brought by drugs.

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,680
That's why I risked everything
to contact Officer An

154
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,280
and told him about the formula.

155
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,240
I want to use

156
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,360
the police's power to save you.

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,880
No matter what punishment you face,

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,760
I'll be by your side for a lifetime.

159
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,360
I love you.

160
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
Nuo.

161
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,360
Dad, save me!

162
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,320
Wang Yu, don't resist.

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
Xu,

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,400
do you remember?

165
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,880
Back when we were

166
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,000
in the womb,

167
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
you were luckier than I was.

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,080
The arm was yours.

169
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
Everything was yours.

170
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,680
I was abandoned

171
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
and mocked.

172
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,240
I was like a pet

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,160
in that family.

174
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,160
Do you know that?

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Han Yu...

176
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
But it's okay.

177
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
Look.

178
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
Someone still loves me.

179
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm not an abandoned pet.

180
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,680
Do you know that?

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,960
Who would have thought

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
it'd end up like this?

183
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
I've moved up recently.

184
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,900
You've become the Director?

185
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,880
Congrats.

186
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,240
No.

187
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,680
I mean that place.

188
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
Do you need help?

189
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,640
Later,

190
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,140
I'll introduce you to two people.

191
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Alright.

192
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Let me say goodbye to him.

193
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
Are the new dishes to your taste?

194
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,680
You're replacing Wang Mingcheng?

195
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,440
What do you have

196
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
to work with us?

197
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,040
I killed Wang Mingcheng.

198
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
The formula

199
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,880
is with me now.

200
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,780
Newcomer, don't talk big.

201
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,960
You might get yourself killed.

202
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,520
Everyone knows

203
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,400
that the formula doesn't exist now.

204
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,240
Even if there was,

205
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
it's locked inside Han Yu's mind.

206
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,800
