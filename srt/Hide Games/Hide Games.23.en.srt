=Episode 23=

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,040
Wang Yu.

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,840
You're right.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,080
You win.

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,280
Name your terms.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,240
What will it take to let her go?

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
You remember now?

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,520
Yes.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,480
She is my wife.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,840
She loves me the most.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
And she's the one I love most.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,520
Please, let her go.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
Yasin.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
I've missed you so much.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
Sorry.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,120
You're finally back.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,670
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,840
You're finally back.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,880
I remember now.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,560
How's it going?

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560
Just like you wanted,

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,400
it's all done.

34
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,600
I've waited so long for you.

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Also,

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Han Xu remembered.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
Alright.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,400
I remember Xiao Ran used

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,240
to tell me to get you to quit smoking,

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,280
but I never once said it to you.

41
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,760
Thanks for telling me.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,280
Don't worry.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll complete the task

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
you asked me to.

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,760
You're not Wang Yu.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
Who are you?

47
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Sorry, Chief Han.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,320
Long time no see.

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
My bad.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,360
Just messing with you.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Wang Yu told you to do this, right?

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,200
Where is he?

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,740
Ask him to come and talk to me.

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,040
Wishing you forever happiness.

55
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
A perfect match for life.

56
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,320
Was someone hurt?

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,440
Boss Jiu is gone.

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,520
Wang Yu's target isn't me.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
What is he after?

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm making Nuo

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
my daughter,

62
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,720
so she can suffer

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,600
every bit of pain I've been through.

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Pendant.

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,520
Where's Nuo?

66
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,280
What pendant?

67
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,660
- Nuo's fine.
- What happened?

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,400
She skipped school.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,520
Someone's protecting her.

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,360
I never gave her

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,600
a cartoon pendant.

72
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,200
It must've been Wang Yu
pretending to be me.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
So,

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,760
the formula might be hidden inside.

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,260
He wants to use Wang Mingcheng
to hurt Nuo.

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
Let's go.

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,680
Sister Hui.

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
I want to buy Dad a gift.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,280
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

80
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
How about this place?

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
Okay.

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
Boss, I've seen it.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,800
That thing is hanging
on the little girl's neck.

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Each one has betrayed me.

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,280
Has he been found?

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
Boss, Boss.

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
Found him?

88
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,460
No.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,520
But someone sent a letter.

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
It's addressed to you.

91
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,660
(Godfather, long time no see.)

92
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,860
(Want the formula?
It's inside this pendant.)

93
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,720
Dad once gave me a pink one.

94
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
I want to give him a blue one.

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,520
Okay, no problem.

96
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Let's go.

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
Here.

98
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,460
Hello.

99
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,960
Miss, I want to buy this.

100
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,790
- Please wrap it.
- Sure.

101
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,240
Sure, let me get you a bag for that.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,580
- Okay?
- Sure.

103
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Please take this.

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,360
Where's Nuo?

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
She's here with me.

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Get her back to the station now.

107
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,600
Got it.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
Back then, to save me,

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,520
you fell with Wang Yu.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,840
Before that happened,

111
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,120
he was very unstable.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,120
He told us a lot

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
about your childhood,

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,100
what happened to him
after he met Wang Mingcheng,

115
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,040
his love for Xiao Ran,

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
and his hatred toward you.

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
You fell unconscious.

118
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,440
The guilt was crushing.

119
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,120
It made you lose your memory

120
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
and caused severe cognitive confusion.

121
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,920
You always wished you could

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,000
take his pain for him.

123
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,440
When I was little,

124
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
my mom told me

125
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
I once had a high fever,

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
but she told me

127
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,880
it was just a regular cold.

128
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
Only now do I realize

129
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,960
that it was all my fault.

130
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,560
I made my younger brother

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,160
go through so much pain.

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,240
But I somehow forgot it all.

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
That's selective amnesia.

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,640
You were a kid back then.

135
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,680
You couldn't handle that pain.

136
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,800
And this time,

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
I even forgot about you.

138
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,800
I was such an awful man.

139
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,260
I'm just glad you're back.

141
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,440
This is what Mr. An found.

142
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,540
See if there's any lead.

143
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,580
(An Shaocong's Report)

144
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,290
What's wrong?

145
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,800
Chief, someone's attacking us.

146
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,040
Protect Nuo. I'm on my way.

147
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
Hurry.

148
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
No need to be scared.

149
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,280
Have you played hide-and-seek?

150
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,120
We're playing hide-and-seek now.

151
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
Okay?

152
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,520
Don't move.

153
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,600
Stop right there.

154
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,550
Freeze.

155
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
Don't run.

156
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
Everyone, freeze.

157
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,640
Luckily, you made it in time.

158
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,580
You're not hurt, right?

159
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,360
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

160
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,680
Hold on.

161
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,280
Let me explain to Nuo first.

162
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
Nuo.

163
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Thank you both.

164
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
No need.

165
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
Nuo.

166
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
Remember our promise?

167
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,440
Yes. Dad is a narcotics officer.

168
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,760
I have to pretend not to know Dad

169
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,120
to keep him safe.

170
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,960
Han Shuyang.

171
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,880
The game's over now.

172
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I've always treated it as my amulet.

173
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Now, I want you to have it.

174
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,800
Don't bother him.

175
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,280
Your daughter?

176
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,280
Yes, Nuo is eight now.

177
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,600
Nuo, go back to your room.

178
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,400
- Mom, I want...
- Be good.

179
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,000
Doctor Chen.

180
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,960
I have to go.

181
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,840
I have to pretend not to know Dad

182
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
to keep him safe.

183
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,800
Dad!

184
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
Nuo.

185
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Get in the car.

186
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,000
Hurry.

187
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
What were you thinking?

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,880
You said you'd get revenge.

189
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,560
Then you just disappeared.

190
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,290
I've been looking for you.

191
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,760
Do you know how hard it's been?

192
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,060
And what did you do?

193
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,760
You sent me a random photo

194
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,200
and led me to that awful place.

195
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,560
All my people are gone.

196
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,840
The formula is in your head, right?

197
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,560
You should've come back sooner

198
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,120
to save me all this trouble.

199
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
Godfather.

200
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,360
Of course, I have my reasons.

201
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,440
If I don't lure you over there

202
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,960
to meet them,

203
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,960
you wouldn't have waited for me

204
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,360
to pick you up.

205
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,400
If you hadn't let me take you back,

206
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,760
how could I kill you?
