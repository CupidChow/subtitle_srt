=Episode 11=

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,520
The scene was cleaned up well.

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,080
There's not much evidence left.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
The victim is Zhang Ahua.

14
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,160
She was shot in the head.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
Her computer files

16
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,520
are almost gone.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,680
The Tech Unit is on it.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,960
But I'm not too hopeful.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
Anything else?

20
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,160
Witnesses told me a few things.

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,400
But I managed to withhold it.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
They said before the victim died,

23
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,200
Han Xu had been here.

24
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,290
Over there, hurry!

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,170
Move fast!

26
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,720
Stop right there!

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,040
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Stop right there.

29
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't move.

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Don't move.

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
Don't move.

32
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Why did you kill him?

33
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Who are you?

34
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
You don't need to know who I am.

35
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Just remember one thing:

36
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
This is for your own good.

37
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,040
Tell me now,

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
or I'll kill you.

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,760
Want a combat?

40
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Wait until you're healed.

41
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Tell the mastermind

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
I'll find him.

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll pass your message along.

44
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,500
(Stop)

45
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,500
(South Transitional Prison)

46
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,800
Leave.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,280
Why pretend to be sick?

48
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,120
Mr. Han.

49
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
What happened to you?

50
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,160
Lock the door.

51
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Mr. Han.

52
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
Who was clueless enough to do this?

53
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,620
Also,

54
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,360
there are so many major hospitals.

55
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,160
Why come to my small clinic?

56
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
I get it.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,200
I'll mind my own business.

58
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't tell anyone I was here.

59
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,880
Understood.

60
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,500
(Zhang Ahua)

61
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm Zhang Ahua. Have some respect.

62
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,320
I don't have time for your nonsense.

63
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,520
I'm Zhang Ahua. Have some respect.

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,180
I don't have time for your nonsense.

65
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,460
(Unknown number)

66
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Chief Han.

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,280
I like seeing you so flustered.

68
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,120
Just tell me what you want.

69
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,460
Stop beating around the bush.

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,480
No need to rush.

71
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,520
I have a gift for you.

72
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm not interested.

73
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
You'll change your mind.

74
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,520
Why not check the TV now?

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,640
The timing should be perfect.

76
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,720
Recently, a serious murder
has happened in the south.

77
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,560
The victim's name was Zhang Ahua.

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,720
The police are working hard...

79
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
Chief Han.

80
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,120
What's going on?

81
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
What do you need me for?

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,540
(Zhang Ahua)
I'm most worried about my sister.

83
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,680
You keep the money.

84
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,360
Please.

85
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,320
Take care of my sister for me.

86
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,680
Can you do that?

87
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,960
If I can get through this,

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
I'll treat her like my own sister.

89
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,880
Someone made me say that.

90
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,600
You're the boss of Room 4.

91
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,360
How does that sound to you?

92
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll kill you.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,560
But I won't do that to you.

94
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
That would be too easy on you.

95
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll make everyone who helps you,

96
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,280
everyone you care about,
and who cares about you,

97
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
become my gift to you.

98
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,840
I told you I'd find you.

99
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,520
Your spirit is impressive,

100
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,840
but now's not the time.

101
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,400
You need to get ready.

102
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm giving you the second gift.

103
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,200
This poor soul

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,560
was supposed
to meet you tonight at eight.

105
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,000
But he can't wait any longer.

106
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,640
Only you can save him now.

107
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,800
You have just 30 minutes.

108
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,390
Mr. Han.

109
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
You really need some rest.

110
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,740
You've defied deities.

111
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,740
You should be punished.

112
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,000
Hey.

113
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
The hacker helping Han Xu is dead.

114
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,000
Who did it?

115
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,270
We still don't know.

116
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,640
But this is already the second death

117
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,800
because of our plan.

118
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
Your instincts were right.

119
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,080
And you made the right call.

120
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,040
What if I don't agree?

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,560
Our plan has changed now.

122
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,440
We're no longer on our original path.

123
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,060
Look at what happened yesterday.

124
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Han Xu and I got hit by a car.

125
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
It was this driver.

126
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,520
When I looked into him,

127
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,560
he was already silenced.

128
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,520
There are just too many risks now.

129
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,100
We have to find out who's behind this.

130
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Or things will get even messier.

131
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,960
Then Han Xu will figure out our plan,

132
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,000
and we'll lose everything.

133
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,520
Are you sure you're not the problem?

134
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,760
I can't promise you that.

135
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,380
You have to take that risk.

136
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm picking up this call

137
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,260
and giving it one last shot.

138
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,400
If it still doesn't work,

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,260
I'll let you know to arrest him.

140
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,240
Alright.

141
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
Only when he's right under my nose

142
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
can he truly be safe.

143
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,520
Whoever you are,

144
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm busy right now.

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,920
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

146
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Chief Wang, you can disagree.

147
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
Let's see what you've got.

148
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
The gift is on the boat.

149
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,760
It's been half an hour.

150
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,750
