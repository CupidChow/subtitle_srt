11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,780
(Wu)
Master, where are you?

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,480
I found a clue in 405.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,480
Eight tonight at the usual place.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,280
This poor soul

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,640
was supposed
to meet you tonight at eight.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
But he can't wait any longer.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,480
Only you can save him now.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,920
Han Xu.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,520
Over here.

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Don't move.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,160
Master.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,320
Think.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,520
Master.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,400
Tell me who he is.

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,760
Master.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
Who is he?

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,960
- Master.
- Who is he?

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
Tell me who he is.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
Who is he?

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
Tell me.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,560
Who is he?

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,720
Think. Who is he?

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,820
Tell me who he is.

34
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,720
Tell me.

35
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,170
Tell me who he is.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
Seems you really like this pendant.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,960
My dad gave it to me.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,040
I've always treated it as my amulet.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,920
Now, I want you to have it.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When we meet again,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
you can give it back to me.

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,880
Nuo, go back to your room.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,160
Mom, I want to let...

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Be good.

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,840
Alright.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,920
Sorry about that.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
She really misses her dad.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,960
Where is this place?

49
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,080
How did I end up here?

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
This is my old house.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,360
Don't worry; it's safe here.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,320
What happened to you?

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,200
Did you remember anything?

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,800
Can I trust you?

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,720
Of course.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,120
You have to trust me.

57
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,020
After all you've been through...

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,120
Nothing came back to you?

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Nothing at all.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
I just felt

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
a bit disappointed

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
and sad.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Nothing else.

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
I hope everything goes well

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,280
and Chen can make it.

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,240
If you want to succeed,

67
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,880
don't rush the plan too much.

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,400
Now, it's full of holes.

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
Don't think I don't know

70
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,880
the things you did in secret.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
The one who is ruining the plan

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,280
is you.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
If you'd like,

74
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,480
I can try hypnosis again.

75
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,480
Let's give it a shot.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Sure.

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,600
Mom.

78
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,260
I'll wash my face and get ready.

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Director.

80
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,880
You said it.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,440
This is my case,

82
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,160
and I'll take charge of everything.

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Right here.

84
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,660
Send a few more people downstairs.

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,680
Let's just wait and see.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,320
He doesn't trust me anymore.

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Got it.

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Chief Han.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,080
This call came later than I expected.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
You seem to know me pretty well.

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Of course, better than you think.

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,760
How else would I prepare
such a thoughtful gift?

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,600
I told you

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
I'd get a return gift for you.

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm going to kill you.

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,160
Want to kill me?

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,600
Figure out who I am first.

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,720
I will find out.

99
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,050
How many days have we been here?

100
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,000
What are we waiting for?

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,480
Did we mess something up at work?

102
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,180
Is that why they sent us here?

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,360
- Look at that.
- Stop whining.

104
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,480
Let's finish this and go.

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
We can grab drinks after.

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Let's leave now.

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,490
No way.

108
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,330
Let's go.

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,400
Hey man, did this phone get wet?

110
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,500
Luckily, it's this model.

111
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
Or I wouldn't have taken it.

112
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
Name your price.

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,860
Give me however much you want.

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,500
There's an audio recording inside.

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,620
Save it to this USB drive.

116
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,700
Take the fee from that.

117
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,600
Got it.

118
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,420
(Import Sound)

119
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Of course,

120
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
better than you think.

121
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,990
How else would I prepare

122
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,630
such a thoughtful gift?

123
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,060
(Sound Synthesis)

124
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,340
Want to kill me?

125
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Chief Han.

126
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,180
Figure out who I am first.

127
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,580
Figure out who I am first.

128
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,140
Figure out who I am first.

129
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
(Analysis Successful)
Want to kill me?

130
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
Figure out who I am first.

131
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,900
Want a combat?

132
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,780
Wait until you're healed.

133
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,460
No problem, that's what friends do.

134
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,340
Please.

135
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,540
Take care of my sister for me.

136
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,570
Can you do that?

137
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,620
If you hadn't come to me,

138
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,980
you'd never spot the trick.

139
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,100
She's really naive.

140
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm afraid she'll get scammed.

141
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,020
Someone made me say that.

142
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,260
Hey, I want to check out.

143
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,420
Single room.

144
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,700
ID, please.

145
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,940
I forgot to bring it.

146
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,660
100 for an 85-room.

147
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,890
Second floor.

148
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,200
The one at the end of the hall.

149
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,420
(Feels like Home)

150
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,620
(Xiao Ran, An Shaocong, Wang Jian,
Chen Yasin, Zhang Ahua, Chief Ma)

151
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,980
It was from a temporary number.

152
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
He said

153
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,500
his name was Han Xu.

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
(Was it me? The killer?)

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,900
I just saw the whole crime happen.

156
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,980
Like I was right there in it.

157
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,180
(Chen Yasin)

158
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,060
From what I see,

159
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,740
you don't have a split personality.

160
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,380
(Watch out)

161
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,820
(Director Zhou)
If you choose wrong,

162
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,540
there's no turning back.

163
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,140
(Wang Jian, police, plot)
I won't let you get away again.

164
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,980
(Police, plot)

165
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,020
I'll look into everything.

166
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,500
(Wu, trusted friend)
Only we know this dialect.

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,440
(An Shaocong)
Reliable.

168
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,540
(Chen Yasin)
Don't give up.

169
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,480
(Reliable, Zhang Ahua)

170
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,820
(Xiao Ran)

171
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,080
(Memories)

172
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,020
(Was it me? The killer?)

173
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,120
(Chief Ma, Director Zhou)

174
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:11,980
(Director Zhou)

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,240
(Wu)

176
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,440
(Odd)

177
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,640
(Ma)

178
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:12,880
(Zhou)

179
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,180
(Ahua)

180
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,340
(An)

181
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,540
(Ran)

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:13,800
(Chen)

183
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,060
(Wang)

184
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,700
(Me)

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,740
(Memories coming back)

186
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,180
(The student could be fake)

187
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,300
How did your mom teach you?

188
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,500
I asked for cigarettes,
yet you brought water.

189
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,440
How did you mix up water and cigarettes?

190
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,860
You always speak dialect.

191
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,980
I can't understand you.

192
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,660
No dialect next time.

193
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
Get me a glass of water.

194
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,940
Water.

195
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,540
It's been ages since I spoke dialect.

196
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,200
I can barely catch the words.

197
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,660
(Wu)

198
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,820
(Wu)

199
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,180
(Wu)

200
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,180
Officer 67234 reporting in.

201
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
From now on, you'll be my master.

202
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,660
There's a bit of history between us.

203
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,820
So, please look out for me.

204
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,700
Who are you?

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,300
I don't think I've seen you before.

206
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,580
You don't know?

207
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,900
I'm your junior.

208
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,100
In the whole South District,

209
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,300
only we share a hometown.

210
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,620
Back home, you're a big deal.

211
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,460
Did you know that?

212
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,420
Master,

213
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,220
have some water.

214
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,300
Master,

215
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,940
how about a cigarette?

216
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
It's been ages since I heard our accent.

217
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,780
You speak it really well.

218
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,100
Of course.

219
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,220
I grew up there for over 20 years.

220
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,060
It's in my bones.

221
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,360
No way I got this wrong.

222
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,500
(Wu)

223
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,780
It's been ages since I spoke dialect.

224
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,520
I can barely catch the words.

225
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,380

226
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,180
From now on, you'll be my master.
