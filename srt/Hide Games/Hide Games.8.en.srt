=Episode 8=

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,280
Chief Han, impressive moves.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,640
How's Chen doing?

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,760
Chief Ma, you're even better.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,430
One hid inside the house,

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,760
and another in the car.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,080
Better safe than sorry, you know.

17
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,640
Especially since I'm meeting you.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,950
Now tell me,

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,520
who do you work for?

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,160
Of course, I'm with the police station.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,160
If the station wanted to catch me,

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,960
they'll send more men.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,200
Han,

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,920
being too smart
isn't always a good thing.

25
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,080
South District, to bail someone out.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm the real victim,

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,490
yet you locked me up

28
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,630
for more than 24 hours.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,300
- This is
- When out, I'll file

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,690
- statement letter.
- a complaint.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Dr. Chen,

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,520
please be patient.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,580
My daughter's at home.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,600
If anything happens to her,

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,720
I'll make sure you all pay for it.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,240
Don't worry,

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,960
Nuo is perfectly safe.

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
This isn't the way to my house.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,840
You need to verify something
at the station.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
Like I said,

41
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm the victim here.

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,360
I got kidnapped.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,440
My kid's still at home.

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Nuo is at the station.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
You used my kid to pressure me.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,280
Han Xu was the one who took you.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,920
So we've been watching Nuo for you.

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,160
Mom, where did you go?

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,880
Nuo's been waiting for you so long.

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
Good girl,

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
is everything okay?

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,640
Yes.

53
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,240
This lady played with me all night.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
I already ate like you asked.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,880
That's good to hear.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Play with her a bit more.

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
Mom just needs a sec.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,640
Then I'll take you home, okay?

59
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
Okay, Mom.

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
Close the door.

61
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,300
Cut to the chase.

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,440
Where's Han Xu?

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Han,

64
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
don't blame me.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm just following orders.

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Why waste time talking to him?

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Let's just do it.

68
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,680
It's done.

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,340
Really?

70
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,500
My years spent on you are worth it.

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,140
Where is it? Give it to me.

72
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,860
But I have two conditions.

73
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,300
Go ahead.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,820
Even ten conditions, I'd agree.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,500
First, I want out of the Organization.

76
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,900
Second, I want to leave with Xiao Ran.

77
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,100
You really do care about her.

78
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,650
Want to marry her, huh?

79
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,500
Yeah, I do.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,580
I can't stand who I am anymore.

81
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,860
I'll quit.

82
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,060
No way.

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,900
Why not?

84
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,620
We had a deal.

85
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,820
I'm planning to take care of Xiao Ran.

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,580
She might be an informant for the police.

87
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,480
Her being alive is the biggest threat

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,660
to us both.

89
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,500
That's why I'm taking her.

90
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,740
Once we're gone, you won't be at risk.

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,580
Only the dead can't threaten anyone.

92
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,660
If you lay a finger on her,

93
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,220
I swear you'll never get what you want.

94
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,500
Alright, fine.

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,380
My son's all grown up now.

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,580
Doesn't listen to me anymore, huh?

97
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,500
Well,

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,900
you can stay in this room

99
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,060
and reflect.

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,140
Don't even try to use Xiao Ran's fate

101
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,780
to threaten me.

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,340
Hello, sir.

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,660
A gentleman just mentioned,

104
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,820
you have a special situation,

105
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,660
so you can't go out.

106
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,500
We'll deliver your meal on time.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,660
Have a great day.

108
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,380
Remember this.

109
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,660
The clue is in 405.

110
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,860
Where's Han Xu?

111
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,740
Isn't that your job to find out?

112
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,580
Chen Yasin,

113
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,300
it's not that we doubt you.

114
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,100
Don't you think it's all too convenient?

115
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,780
And I don't believe you escaped

116
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,180
someone as careful as Han Xu.

117
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,020
What do you mean?

118
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,990
You think I'm working with him?

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,060
Where's your proof?

120
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,180
What's my motive?

121
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,700
That's enough.

122
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,260
Chen Yasin,

123
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,140
we both know what's going on.

124
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,940
So maybe talk to me as someone else.

125
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,700
Director Zhou,

126
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,100
what role are you taking on,

127
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,260
coming all the way to see me?

128
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,780
Of course, I'm here as a friend.

129
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,140
Xiao Han,

130
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,140
it was my idea for Ma and Chen.

131
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,380
Let me apologize first.

132
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,380
We really acted a bit rashly.

133
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,340
You managed to leave
Wang Jian and Wu behind

134
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
to get all the way here.

135
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,700
That's no small feat.

136
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,100
No wonder everyone speaks highly of you.

137
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,580
Even with your memory loss,

138
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,100
your instincts are still spot on,

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,420
always catching the real issue right away.

140
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,620
So, I'll get straight to the point.

141
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,540
Things at the police station are tense.

142
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,780
I'm in a dilemma.

143
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,860
There's no one I can trust.

144
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,860
Everyone has their own agenda.

145
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,700
I'm really sorry.

146
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,160
I don't have the answer you want.

147
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,660
You might not have answers yet,

148
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,700
but that doesn't mean

149
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,860
the answer isn't somewhere in your mind.

150
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,300
Look at this abandoned building.

151
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,060
Have you ever wondered,

152
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,740
how did you lose your memory?

153
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,900
You're saying,

154
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,740
I fell from here?

155
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,620
Surviving great hardship

156
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,060
brings good fortune.

157
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,940
I'm the one who made you fall again.

158
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,180
Did anything come back to you?

159
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,120
You should call me dad.

160
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,500
Calling me by name?

161
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,860
I really hate who I am now.

162
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
I'll quit.

163
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,140
Director Zhou,

164
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
are you that sure

165
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
I'm clean too?

166
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,340
Listen to yourself.

167
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,180
In this police department,

168
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,300
if you're not clean,

169
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,260
then no one here is.

170
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,500
Sorry.

171
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,020
I didn't remember anything.

172
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,060
I was just too scared.

173
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,540
Got it.

174
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,780
I did this

175
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,260
so you'd at least remember me.

176
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,260
If you ever recall something

177
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,740
and feel like talking,

178
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,220
please, be careful about it.

179
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,420
Choose wisely.

180
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,580
Make the right choice

181
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,900
and the truth will come out.

182
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,660
But if you're wrong,

183
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,060
you might never recover from it.

184
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,020
Li,

185
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,240
can you leave us alone?

186
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,860
Chief Wang,

187
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,660
Director Zhou just went over the rules.

188
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,860
Is it really okay

189
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,700
for me to leave now?

190
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,580
Not a formal interrogation.

191
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,660
I just want to talk to Dr. Chen

as someone else, that's all.

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,500

Alright, Chief Wang.

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,300
About what happened,

196
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,460
I'll be reporting it.

197
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,900
That's fine.

198
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,020
You can speak now.

199
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,900
Where is he?

200
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,600
Can you still be trusted?

201
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,180
Why did you change our plan without asking?
