The National Forensic Service
will conduct a detailed hair analysis.

8

If that also comes back positive...

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,867
I did not do it!

Student Baek Jenna,

11
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:11,833
we must follow the rules and procedures.

12
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,767
We'll mobilize all our channel
resources to the fullest

13
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,867
and make the biggest splash.

14
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,767
You're doing well.

15
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:41,200
Yes, please proceed that way.

16
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,800
I...

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,933
did everything you told me to do,

18
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,033
and Baek Jenna

19
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,800
ended up exactly as you wanted.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,067
Hm...

21
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:55,266
So?

22
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,567
Delete the video.

23
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,767
What video?

24
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,167
Are you pretending not to know?

25
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,267
Oh, that one?

26
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,467
I don't want to.

27
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,467
I did everything you asked.

28
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,767
You think that's enough?

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,667
You should be grateful

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,533

31
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,733

about making me your pet
and getting me into Diamond 6

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,367
was just a game to you?

34

Hey, how old are you?

35
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,167
Gosh, you're so naive.

36
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,700

38
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,867
Why?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,533
If you act like a pet one more time,

40
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,467
I'll delete it then.

41
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,733
Stop crying

42
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,000

would your father accept her into the family?

58

She might have taken the medicine unknowingly,

59

188
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Please, take a seat.

189
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, let's do that.

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
It seems Jenna did this without knowing.

191
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,567
The lawyer said that point
will be taken into consideration.

192
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,400
The school is also making efforts.

193
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,267
You have always worked hard for us.

194
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,233
Don't mention it.

195
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,633
Well, then,

196
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:34,467
let's proceed with our children's
engagement ceremony as planned.

197
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:38,567
I'm grateful to hear you say that.

198
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,167
For business people,

199
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:47,333
isn't this level of risk always present?

200
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,033
Thank you for understanding.

201
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,533
But, well...

202
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,433
From our perspective,

203
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,367
it's about shouldering the risk
for one person, right?

204
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:01,933
Instead of us sharing the risk for one person,

205
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:05,933
we'd like you to show some sincerity.

206
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
What do you mean?

207
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,333
A request to sell Hanmyeong Holdings shares

208
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:17,033
allocated to Jin Wook's portion.

209
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,767
Given that we're about to become in-laws,

210
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:26,467
consider this an investment
for the children's future.

211
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,700
You should think of it that way.

212
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,300
The investment in our Chasel Medic division

213
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,833
will be handled by Jin Wook.

214
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,800
The engagement ceremony will proceed as scheduled.

215
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,067
You can take responsibility
for your own words, can't you?

216
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,833
- Yes.
- This matter

217
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,200
must not fail under any circumstances.

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Hearing that I'm bringing in
a drug-addict daughter-in-law

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,833
isn't a solution, you know?

220
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,033
I understand.

221
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,900
I will

222
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,967
resolve it without fail.

223
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,367
Call her.

224
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,167
Now.

225
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,600
Who is this?

226
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,533
What?

227
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,133
Can you let me stay

228
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,767
just for one night?

229
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,600
Come in.

230
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,500
It's cancer.

231
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,567
By the time I realized, it was too late.

232
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:16,067
You should have told me
if you brought in a friend.

233
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,067
- Huh?
- Here.

234
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,533
When did you buy this?

235
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,333
The floor is warm?

236
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,633
- You're not cold?
- No, not at all.

237
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,100
I will make breakfast in the morning,

238
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,400
so eat with your friend before leaving.

239
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,067
I'm fine.

240
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,133
I don't usually eat breakfast.

241
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,733
She will not eat. Just leave.

242
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,367
Alright? Then I'll crank up the boiler,

243
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:38,767
so sleep comfortably.

244
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:39,833
Yes.

245
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,500
Thank you for your concern.

246
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,100
Your friend is so kind and polite.

247
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,733
Oh, so sweet.

248
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,800
Dad!

249
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,867
She's not nice.

250
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,167
- Get out.
- Yeah, okay.

251
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,100
Thanks.

252
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:02,567
For my dad, strawberries are the best treat.

253
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,567
He's really treating you as special.

254
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,100
Do you like strawberries?

255
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,000
My mom

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,167
only craved strawberries
when she was pregnant with me.

257
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,700
But I guess he couldn't buy them often.

258
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,367
My mom likes strawberries too.

259
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,933
Wait, you're not going home?

260
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,567
Can't you tell by looking?

261
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,700
That's why I came here.

262
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,900
Have you eaten?

263
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,377
I'll make ramyeon.

264
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,200
But have you

265
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,833
ever tried things like ramyeon before?

266
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,700
Are you crazy?

267
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I thought people like you
didn't eat stuff like ramyeon.

268
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,933
Die, you wretch!

269
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,867
Who the hell are you!

270
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,533
Mess with her again and you're dead.

271
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,100
Get lost!

272
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,967
This is stalking.

273
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:59,267
I've recorded all your sneaky following around.

274
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:02,300
Leave voluntarily if you don't
want police to be involved.

275
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:08,600
Ah, darn it!

276
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Hye In, are you okay?

277
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,333
When I brought you home last time,

278
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,967
I saw Hwang Bo Seok.

279
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,167
I thought that might be the case.

280
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,500
I had no idea at all.

281
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,633
Thanks.

282
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:36,400
Just in case, I'll come tomorrow morning too.

283
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,933
No, I have someone to go with tomorrow.

284
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,667
I really appreciate your help.

285
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,200
Get home safe.

286
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Okay.

287
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,533
You go in first.

288
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,833
I want to see you go inside.

289
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,967
I'll go then.

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,067
Are you asleep?

291
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,867
No.

292
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,567
How should I live from now on?

293
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,033
You see me like this and still say that?

294
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,567
I just

295
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,900
wish someone would tell me the right answer.

296
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,533
What good are answers others give you?

297
00:20:56,533 --> 00:21:00,633
People like you don't need that.

298
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:03,567
Your environment is different from mine.

299
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,767
What we can never have,

300
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,233
you already have everything.

301
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:16,667
Why do you keep thinking people
like us are special or different?

302
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:20,600
On the surface, it may seem that way.

303
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,567
Just because we have money doesn't
mean we lack worries or loneliness.

304
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,767
Everyone lives the same way.

305
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,867
Eat, shit, repeat...

306
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:32,433
But still...

307
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,100
Everyone's lives are similar.

308
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,933
It's just how they live that's different.

309
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,600
But, you

310
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,733
didn't do drugs, right?

311
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:45,867
Are you crazy?

312
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,800
Ha Min Hee must've switched it.

313
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,333
Then what about the drugs in your locker?

314
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,867
Min Yul Hee probably ordered it.

315
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,167
But...

316
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,733
What?

317
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,633
Never mind.

318
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,067
What? You stopped mid-sentence.

319
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:14,200
Stopping mid-sentence is your habit?

320
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,067
I

321
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,700
saw Min Yul Hee and Cha Jin Wook kissing.

322
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,467
- At school.
- What?

323
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,667
They kissed?

324
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,533
Min Yul Hee dragged him down,

325
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,633
and Cha Jin Wook seems to be trying something too.

326
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,133
Let them do as they please.

327
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:56,433
I

328
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:59,100
am going to get engaged to
Cha Jin Wook of Chasel Medic.

329
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,900
What?

330
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,300
What about Woo Jin?

331
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,100
I don't know. I'll break off the engagement.

332
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,000
Min Yul Hee, do you think
you can decide that on your own?

333
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,700
Plus, Hanmyeong's Baek Jenna is there.

334
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,767
I'm the one who ruined Baek Jenna.

335
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,033
That's why I'm trying to get
engaged to Cha Jin Wook.

336
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:18,700
Mom, just help me find a dress.

337
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,767
Why?

338
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,700
Honestly, compared to Park Woo Jin's hotel,

339
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,267
Chasel Medic is better.

340
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:33,867
You know how your mom and dad got married, right?

341
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:36,467
When you see something good,
you have to claim it fast.

342
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:39,133
Otherwise, someone else will take it.

343
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,867
Are you confident?

344
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,300
A few days ago,

345
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,400
when you bumped into me under the overpass,

346
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,667
what were you doing there?

347
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,200
Oh, that?

348
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,833
I'll tell you later.

349
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,333
That day, Oh Si Eun's phone

350
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,267
was snatched by someone.

351
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:08,900
What?

352
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,500
Who?

353
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,933
It's not certain yet,

354
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,733
but I think it's Park Woo Jin.

355
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,567
Park Woo Jin?

356
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,533
Why him?

357
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,367
He seems to be the culprit

358
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,033
in Oh Si Eun's case.

359
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:26,867
What?

360
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,500
What a psycho!

361
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:32,833
But,

362
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,167
what can you possibly do?

363
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:37,667
We have to fight.

364
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:41,233
Everything I have is at stake here.

365
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,800
Hey, we need to go this way.

366
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,967
You go ahead. I have somewhere else to be.

367
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,067
Hey!

368
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:03,400
Back in the day,

369
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,567
I used to wonder why you guys
never wore coats or paddings.

370
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,700
