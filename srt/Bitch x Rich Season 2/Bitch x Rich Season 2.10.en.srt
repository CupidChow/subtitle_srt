1
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:39,033
[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:42,867
[One week before the engagement ceremony]

3
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:48,300
[Kim Hye In]

4
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,500
Hey!

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,833
Are we close enough for you to call at this hour?

6
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,405
What?

7
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,300
You're in front of my house?

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,033
Well...

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,400
Usually at engagement ceremonies or weddings,

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,667
close friends give congratulatory speeches, right?

11
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:28,433
Can I do that?

12
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,567
What?

13
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,433
Of course,

14
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,200
the idea of you and I being friends is absurd.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,533
But I entered the school and Diamond 6
through Hanmyeong Scholarship Foundation,

16
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:42,600
so I thought there might be some significance.

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,132
Okay.

18
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:46,600
Huh?

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,700
You do the speech.

20
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,764
Thanks.

21
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,502
It was pretty warm.

22
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,333
Yeah.

23
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:18,067
That's a relief.

24
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,433
I'll count on you

25
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,000
for the speech.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,615
But,

27
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,500
I feel disappointed

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
that you said

29
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,342
we're not friends.

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,433
Ah...

31
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:46,067
Then, I'll get going.

32
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,167
And at that moment,

33
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:20,567
I saw the person who pushed Kim Hae In.

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,533
I was allowed

35
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,467
to enter this school under the condition

36
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:33,967
that I stay silent about
the culprit who pushed her.

37
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:37,900
And within Cheongdam International High School's

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,533
Diamond 6,

39
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,833
there is a murderer

40
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,167
who tried to kill Kim Hae In by pushing her.

41
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:52,133
The culprit who pushed
Kim Hae In is present today!

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,967
That criminal is none other than

43
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:57,533
a member of Diamond 6,

44
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,800
Min Yul Hee!

45
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,033
So it finally comes to this.

46
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,600
You're digging your own grave.

47
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,067
The culprit who tried to kill Kim Hae In
by pushing her from the rooftop

48
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,367
is Min Yul Hee.

49
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,733
Though Kim Hae In miraculously woke up,

50
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,400
she was blackmailed by
Min Yul Hee with another video

51
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,200
and ultimately couldn't bear it any longer,

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
so she took her own life.

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,733
Hey, Kim Hye In!

54
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:48,367
Min Yul Hee used hidden camera footage

55
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:53,133
to blackmail me into falsely testifying
that Baek Jenna was the murderer.

56
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:59,367
Kim Hae in died

57
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,433
right in front of me.

58
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,167
She asked for help

59
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,867
and said I was the only one who could testify.

60
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,967
But,

61
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,700
because I hesitated,

62
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,667
Kim Hae In died because of me... What should I do?

63
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,767
Kim Hae In

64
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,767
is dead?

65
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,067
Min Yul Hee

66
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,467
blackmailed me with my video.

67
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,267
I'm sick of Min Yul Hee's blackmail

68
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:36,233
and the Diamond 6 badge
you gave me. It's all disgusting.

69
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,900
I'm going to reveal it all,

70
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,400
what Min Yul Hee did to me and Kim Hae In

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,900
and everything she has done so far.

72
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,800
Min Yul Hee also

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,067
pushed Oh Si Eun

74
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,133
from the rooftop.

75
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,567
What the hell is that crazy girl saying?

76
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:56,478
Stop her! Drag that lunatic off the stage!

77
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,467
Everything you've worked for,

78
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,667
you'll lose it all.

79
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:05,074
Your videos will spread
everywhere before this ends.

80
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,619
Are you really okay with this?

81
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,494
It can't be worse than the current hell.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,633
Throw yourself into the pit you dug.

83
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,500
Let's begin!

84
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,367
If that's the case,

85
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,233
there is someone who can help.

86
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,333
Excuse me? Yul Hee is looking for you.

87
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,967
She said the wrong video came out.

88
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,700
Hello? The wrong video was released.

89
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,633
- What?
- The wrong video was released.

90
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,167
Yul Hee is looking for you over there.

91
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:16,733
She asked you to come immediately.
Hurry, hurry!

92
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,133
Hurry up!

93
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,100
Wait a moment.

94
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,233
Hey, try opening the door.

95
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,667
Gods. Even if you were paid,

96
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,033
you shouldn't do this.

97
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,867
Hey, you!

98
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:58,333
With this, Min Yul Hee has violated
the Information and Communications Law.

99
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,500
The illegal distribution of hidden camera footage

100
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,567
is punishable by up to 10 years
imprisonment under the current law.

101
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,467
Min Yul Hee just violated the law herself,

102
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:10,200
and illegally distributed
the footage recorded on that phone.

103
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,133
I report Min Yul Hee
as a flagrante delicto offender.

104
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:17,433
That trustworthy friend you mentioned earlier...

105
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,433
Hey, Baek Jenna.

106
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,667
Don't worry. You can trust him.

107
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,067
I roughly heard the story.

108
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,167
What's the plan moving forward?

109
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:37,500
First, I'll make Min Yul Hee expose my footage.

110
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,333
Then she'll be walking into the trap instead.

111
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,200
Hey, even so,

112
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,600
you'll end up having all your videos exposed.

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm prepared for that.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,733
It'll stay with me for life,

115
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,467
but there's no other way.

116
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,767
Don't worry about that.

117
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,367
I'll take care of it.

118
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:59,167
Really? How?

119
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:06,000
Using crawling-based AI to
erase all videos related to you.

120
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:10,933
Such technology exists?

121
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,967
But how do you know about such things?

122
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:18,267
His hobbies are a bit unusual.

123
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,567
Don't tell me you're

124
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,328
the Black Dog?

125
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,900
And I called one more person.

126
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
Can this one really be trusted?

127
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:38,933
Lee Sa Rang?

128
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:44,033
Moreover, there's conclusive evidence
that Min Yul Hee killed Kim Hae In.

129
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,667
When Kim Hae In was dying in front of me,

130
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:52,433
she gave me Min Yul Hee's necklace.

131
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,900
Give me back the necklace Baek Jenna

132
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,667
gave you.

133
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,433
Drag the student who entered out of here.

134
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,800
I knew you'd do this.

135
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,533
I never thought you'd
hand it over willingly either.

136
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,267
Help me!

137
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,533
Someone help me!

138
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,267
Is anyone there?

139
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,567
Help me!

140
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,233
Why are you doing this?

141
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,233
Help me!

142
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,933
This is exactly that necklace.

143
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,733
It's the evidence that
Min Yul Hee killed Kim Hae In.

144
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,800
Though the school knew all this,

145
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,167
they covered everything up.

146
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,204
That's all.

147
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,267
We'll now begin the next show.

148
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:34,967
Let's cut to the chase and watch the screen.

149
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,767
Hello everyone.

150
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,733
Black Dog!

151
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,867
Let me formally introduce myself.

152
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,767
Not Cha Jin Wook of Chasel Medic,

153
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:52,100
but Black Dog Cha Jin Wook.

154
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:56,333
Let's all watch the video together.

155
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,567
<i>I'm Seo Hee Su.</i>

156
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:04,667
Seo Do Un, just do me one favor.

157
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,533
Not for me,

158
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,167
but for the deceased Kim Hae In.

159
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:13,333
We need Chairman Seo Hee Su's testimony.

160
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,767
I testified that Kim Hae In committed suicide,

161
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,800
and in exchange, I transferred schools.

162
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,767
That should suffice.

163
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,667
I don't care.

164
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,622
About anything.

165
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,249
Now,

166
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,200
I'll set everything straight.

167
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,467
<i>Regarding Kim Hae In's fall incident,</i>

168
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,800
<i>I was the one who approved</i>

169
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,100
<i>Kim Hye In's admission</i>

170
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,133
<i>in exchange for concealing the truth.</i>

171
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,567
And

172
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,833
I also confess about framing
Kim Hae In's murder as suicide

173
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,533
and accepting Kim Hye In.

174
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,800
Are you insane?

175
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,567
Don't you realize what will happen
to this school if you do that?

176
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:54,667
Therefore,

177
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,600
do you want to go down together?

178
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,667
Or exit honorably?

179
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,367
<i>Before the name of Cheongdam
International High School,</i>

180
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:06,400
<i>I will take responsibility to the end,</i>

181
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,367
<i>face the heavy responsibility and pay for my sins,</i>

182
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,900
<i>without avoiding the price for this incident.</i>

183
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,400
<i>Once again,</i>

184
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,033
<i>I offer my deepest apologies.</i>

185
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,667
You bastard! Won't you turn it off now?

186
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,467
This violates the promise you made me!

187
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,767
What are you?

188
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,133
Hey, Kim Jin Sang!

189
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:39,057
Go to the control room
and turn this off immediately!

190
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,075
Hey!

191
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,921
That bastard!

192
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,733
Next on the agenda,

193
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,367
there were extremely dirty and vile deeds

194
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,967
between Cheongdam International High School

195
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,400
and Chasel Medic's shady dealings.

196
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,567
What the hell are you doing now?

197
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,933
<i>Oh! Mr. Chairman!</i>

198
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,900
<i>I'm on a business trip abroad.</i>

199
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,933
<i>Ah, Chairman Cha!</i>

200
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:18,267
<i>We successfully acquired shares
through Baek Jenna's drug case.</i>

201
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:22,400
<i>We dropped the stock price with
that incident and bought it cheaply.</i>

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,133
<i>We increased our shares
by posing as foreign investors.</i>

203
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:30,000
<i>Ah, I see. Congratulations!</i>

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,933
Hello.

205
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,800
Hello!

206
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Hello!

207
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,900
<i>Then, we should make our move now.</i>

208
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,467
<i>Just wait a little longer.</i>

209
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:46,667
<i>This time instead of his daughter,
we'll target Chairman Baek</i>

210
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,560
<i>with a filthy sex scandal.</i>

211
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,033
<i>I look forward to it.</i>

212
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:57,433
<i>After completely destroying
the company with owner risk,</i>

213
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,900
<i>Cha Jin Wook will step forward as the face.</i>

214
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,200
<i>Then we'll discard Cha Jin Wook through
drugs or similar means, just like Baek Jenna.</i>

215
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>We'll discard him afterward.</i>

216
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,700
<i>Yes, you've handled it well.</i>

217
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,600
<i>I'll call again then.</i>

218
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,700
<i>Yes, goodbye.</i>

219
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,200
What the hell are you doing
right now? You crazy bastard!

220
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,733
What kind of cheap trick is this?

221
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,900
Are you insane? What's this nonsense?

222
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,333
Chairman Cha Ki Ho of Chasel Medic

223
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,500
planned to devour Hanmyeong Holdings

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,900
and this engagement was just the beginning.

225
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
Chairman Cha Ki Ho of Chasel Medic
and Chairman Seo Hee Kwon

226
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,967
illegally secured shares,

227
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,033
manipulated stock prices,

228
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,600
and even violated private school laws.

229
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Everything was part of their predetermined scheme.

230
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,633
What kind of scam are you pulling?

231
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:48,667
You bastard really...

232
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,867
Mr. Chairman,

233
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,867
the reporters are watching.

234
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,000
Please smile a bit.

235
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,133
Mr. Chairman.

236
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:58,033
I'm SBN Reporter Lee Ho Jong.

237
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:01,267
The information spread through
Black Dog Channel has all been true.

238
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,700
Could you give us a statement?

239
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,300
SBN's Lee Ho Jong, you bastard!

240
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,333
The chairman is hitting a reporter!

241
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,633
- This is assault!
- Hurry!

242
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,700
Hey, film this! Film it!

243
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,733
He's hitting a reporter!

244
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,333
Darn it, move aside!

245
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,000
- Mr. Chairman!
- Mr. Chairman!

246
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,467
Please give us a comment, Mr. Chairman.

247
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,933
- Stop them!
- Mr. Chairman!

248
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,967
I said stop them!

249
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,400
Beyond the corruption I just mentioned,

250
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,067
Chairman Cha Ki Ho and Chairman Seo Hee Kwon

251
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:34,133
even used borrowed-name accounts for slush funds.

252
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,792
It's astonishing!

253
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,858
Now let's watch the final video together.

254
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
<i>I am Park Woo Jin.</i>

255
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,833
<i>All this time,</i>

256
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>I've been gaslighted by Min Yul Hee.</i>

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,033
<i>On the day Oh Si Eun died,</i>

258
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,000
<i>she told me</i>

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,267
<i>to kill Oh Si Eun.</i>

260
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,600
<i>She said those words.</i>

261
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
<i>And then she told me</i>

262
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,367
<i>to just die too.</i>

263
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,767
Hey! Park Woo Jin!

264
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,600
You crazy bastard!

265
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,333
What the hell is that, you lunatic?

266
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,167
It's true, isn't it?

267
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:31,367
You pushed Oh Si Eun that day,
saying you'd kill her.

268
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:32,967
You killed Kim Hae In too,

269
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,600
and said the second one wasn't even a real case.

270
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,967
What nonsense is this, you madman!

271
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:39,500
Hey! You crazy bastard!
How could you do this to me?

272
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,900
- Calm down!
- Hey!

273
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,349
How could you do this to me?

274
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,862
Hey, Park Woo Jin.

275
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:52,396
I know you're the one who killed Oh Si Eun.

276
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:57,633
- Are you insane?
- And I know you didn't do it intentionally.

277
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,800
Min Yul Hee ordered you to do it.

278
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,667
You just need to testify.

279
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:08,000
You've been gaslighted by Min Yul Hee all along.

280
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,033
What are you doing?

281
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,267
Hey!

282
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,933
You recorded this, didn't you?

283
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:21,400
Darn it! Do I look that stupid to you?

284
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Recording? I didn't do any of that.

285
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,133
Then what the hell is this about?

286
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:29,533
There was no CCTV, nothing at all that day.

287
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,700
I was the only witness.

288
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,100
You just need to testify that Min Yul Hee

289
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,267
went to find Oh Si Eun that day
and threatened to kill her.

290
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:40,533
I'll testify that Min Yul Hee

291
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,000
was the one who killed Kim Hae In.

292
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,067
You'll say Min Yul Hee pushed Kim Hae In?

293
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:47,867
I have to do it that way.

294
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:52,967
You're responsible for Kim Hae In's death.

295
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,667
No, actually I...

296
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,633
I've been tormented by that, you know.

297
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:06,800
I haven't slept a wink since yesterday.

298
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,033
I'm not that much of a monster.

299
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,933
I know, Park Woo Jin.

300
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:16,267
So this time, you must step forward.

301
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:17,933
I'll kill all of you.

302
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,833
I'll kill everyone! Hey!

303
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,267
Let go!

304
00:19:23,267 --> 00:19:25,467
I won't let this slide!

305
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,167
You're all pathetic.

306
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,733
Wait, but

307
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:35,233
Seo Do Un won't forgive me either.

308
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:38,933
I'll convince Seo Do Un.

309
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,100
The responsibility for Kim Hae In's death

310
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,500
lies with me too.

311
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,333
Right.

312
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,300
I also want to

313
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:52,133
shake it all off now.

314
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,167
And

315
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,333
never forgive Park Woo Jin.

316
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,533
He's the murderer who killed Oh Si Eun,

317
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:03,267
and the decisive reason
Kim Hae In ended up like that.

318
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,067
Never.

319
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,933
Never forgive him.

320
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,700
This bastard...

321
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,500
You!

322
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,700
Acquiring that must have cost a lot of funds.

323
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,933
How will you cover that?

324
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,867
You should've stuck to being a loan shark.

325
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,167
Why try to imitate a conglomerate unnecessarily?

326
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,800
Why are you doing this?

327
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,933
- Why are you doing this?
- Father!

328
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,767
No.

329
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,000
Chairman Cha Ki Ho, listen carefully.

330
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,433
Don't seek reasons from others.

331
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,567
Reflect on the life you've lived.

332
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,067
Including all the things you've done

333
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:05,333
to me and my mother until now.

334
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,867
Regarding the fake-name accounts and slush funds,

335
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,333
I donated everything to the UN.

336
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,500
You've done a good deed!

337
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,467
You crazy bastard.

338
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,033
Do you think I'll let you get away?

339
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:23,267
Your bluffs

340
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:27,833
will completely crush you at Hanmyeong.

341
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,167
Oh!

342
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,700
Chairman Baek,

343
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,000
that punk holds a grudge against me.

344
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,467
So I've learned my lesson from this.

345
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:43,367
We'll see each other often in court from now on.

346
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,167
Chairman Baek!

347
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,267
Ugh, seriously!

348
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,833
Wait, did he just...

349
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,700
You bastard!

350
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,100
This punk!

351
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,900
You crazy bastard!

352
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,733
Hey, you! Come here!

353
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,900
Come here, you punk!

354
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,500
Cha Jin Wook!

355
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,300
Cha Jin...

356
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,233
How does it feel to lose?

357
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:52,367
Disgusting, right?

358
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,367
What scheme are you pulling?

359
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,700
You have no evidence.

360
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,100
You think that necklace counts as evidence?

361
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,567
I'll testify,

362
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,067
and Park Woo Jin will too.

363
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,509
Plus, you're guilty of spreading
hidden camera footage.

364
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:08,181
Be glad you weren't caught in the act.

365
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:09,461
[Fuck off]

366
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:14,933
Back then, instead of Kim Hae In,
you should've just dropped dead.

367
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,667
You crazy girl!

368
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,200
Let go!

369
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
You better book a flight ticket quickly.

370
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,033
Even though you're a minor,

371
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,700
your crimes are too heinous.

372
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,633
Fleeing far away would be the best option.

373
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,067
You think it's all over?

374
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,333
You think I'll let a leech like you defeat me?

375
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,233
Don't be mistaken.

376
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,967
Nothing will change.

377
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,533
Absolutely nothing will change!

378
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,433
Yul Hee, let's go.

379
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,667
Impressive, Kim Hye In.

380
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,467
I couldn't do it twice.

381
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:21,100
Anyway, I have to admit your
survival skills are top-notch.

382
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,514
It's because you all helped.

383
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,267
Mr. Kim.

384
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,367
Huh? Dad.

385
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,504
It's all settled now, right?

386
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:41,800
Hey!

387
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,967
Did you see the chairman fleeing earlier?

388
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:47,067
His face was fine, so why did he do that?

389
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,233
I'm so hungry now.

390
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:55,733
Sisters, shall we go eat something delicious?

391
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,167
Tteokbokki?

392
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,400
My treat.

393
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,867
You three go celebrate.

394
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,967
I still have things to do.

395
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,200
Where are you going?

396
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,597
Me?

397
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,933
You'll find out later.

398
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,167
Baek Jenna,

399
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:30,633
why are you acting so recklessly?

400
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:31,800
Dad,

401
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,233
Cha Jin Wook

402
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:35,733
transferred all his shares to me.

403
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,133
And to commemorate my engagement, my stepmother

404
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:40,267
also transferred

405
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:44,200
all the shares you gifted her to me.

406
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,100
What? What?

407
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:49,367
What can I do?

408
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,067
Jenna, please!

409
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:54,400
Please, Jenna!

410
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,200
The company shares you received from my dad

411
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,900
should be transferred to me.

412
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,833
Then this matter will remain a secret forever.

413
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,300
And though it's not much, percentage-wise,

414
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:28,100
there's another person who left shares to me.

415
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,867
What nonsense are you spouting now?

416
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:32,967
I thought you might feel left out
if I didn't invite you to this occasion,

417
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,900
so I called Mom.

418
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,700
What? Mom?

419
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,867
Long time no see.

420
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,267
Congratulations, Jenna.

421
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,600
What's there to congratulate?

422
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,467
I already ruined the engagement.

423
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,267
Well, actually,

424
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,800
Jenna has become

425
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,233
the major shareholder of Hanmyeong.

426
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,833
What? What major shareholder?

427
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:07,467
With Mom's shares combined,
I'm now the major shareholder.

428
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:08,667
Mom's shares?

429
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,267
You people are really...

430
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,967
Hey, do you even realize what you're doing?

431
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,967
You should now

432
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,967
start a new life comfortably.

433
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:20,633
Group operations... will be handled by me.

434
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:21,800
You were really weak, weren't you?

435
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,833
- Are you crazy?
- No.

436
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,167
I'm perfectly sane.

437
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:28,233
You're the one who's not in his right mind.

438
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,667
Someone who can't even
care for their closest family,

439
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,533
how can they manage a group?

440
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,000
Just enjoy operating the remaining resorts

441
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,733
and have a good time.

442
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,900
You two should enjoy cozy moments together.

443
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,167
You darn kid!

444
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,233
Oh, and

445
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:46,300
the sponsorships for Cheongdam High
and Hanmyeong Group

446
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,600
will be discontinued.

447
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,133
You've truly gone completely mad?

448
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,967
Dad,

449
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,933
in a few days,

450
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:55,700
there will be a board meeting.

451
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,567
I'll see you then.

452
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,267
Let's go.

453
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,600
Hey, Baek Jenna!

454
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,433
Baek Jenna!

455
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:14,633
You were in it too? Huh?

456
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,000
You're not coming?

457
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,833
Darn it! I thought about acting...

458
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:24,133
Those brats all got fooled, darn it.

459
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,000
Let's go, kids.

460
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,200
Let's go.

461
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,267
Will you go meet your mother?

462
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah.

463
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,167
I'll be taking care of her for now.

464
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,533
I heard from Driver Hong

465
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,200
that it was you.

466
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Ah, that...

467
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:09,633
Well, it was part of the plan.

468
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,567
The bravado...

469
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,433
This is my final gift.

470
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,167
Travel comfortably to Hong Kong.

471
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,133
First class is excessive,

472
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:22,100
so I got you business class.

473
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,100
You've worked hard.

474
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,233
I'm not going to Hong Kong.

475
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:33,967
With Chairman Cha around,
I'll be lying low for a while.

476
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,133
Don't come looking for me if you miss me.

477
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,867
Then,

478
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,333
you won't come back?

479
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,233
I'm not sure.

480
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,433
Why?

481
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,733
Will you get me a job at Hanmyeong?

482
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:49,681
I'll consider it.

483
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,600
Ah, never mind.

484
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,467
I need you.

485
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:57,233
The real war starts now.

486
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,653
Jenna,

487
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,900
you can do this.

488
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,233
The Baek Jenna I know can handle everything alone.

489
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,200
Thanks.

490
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,400
That seemed sincere.

491
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,533
And you're not alone.

492
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:31,328
[Cha Jin Wook]

493
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:36,733
The bus is here. I'll go.

494
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,633
Welcome.

495
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:27,867
What?

496
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,133
Baek Jenna?

497
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,400
May I sit?

498
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,467
Of course. As the leader of
Hanmyeong Group, please sit.

499
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,833
What's the matter?

500
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,600
I'll get straight to the point.

501
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,500
Work with me.

502
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,567
I'm not interested.

503
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:46,667
I'm going to college.

504
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:50,400
And I'll join the company with confidence.

505
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,667
I knew you'd say something like that.
