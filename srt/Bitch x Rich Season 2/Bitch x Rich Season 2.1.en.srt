368
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,033
Everyone has at least one secret

369
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,933
they want to hide.

370
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,433
But did you receive the gift I sent?

371
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,333
Gift?

372
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:39,900
It got there later than I expected.

373
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,033
[Student Baek Jenna has become
a subject for deliberation]

374
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:45,533
[for school violence and the spread of
false information. Please attend the hearing.]

375
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,467
False information?

376
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,033
School violence?

377
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,933
What will you wear
to the disciplinary committee meeting?

378
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,700
Why are you acting so stupidly?

379
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,000
How can I be disciplined?

380
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Who knows?

381
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,000
If you want to live a precious life
with a dirty guy like him, do as you please.

382
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,633
I've definitely made myself clear.

383
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:09,367
But I posted it because it's true,

384
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,933
not a baseless rumor.

385
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,000
So it was you.

386
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,867
The one who posted that trashy article.

387
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:30,500
I also know something about you
that isn't a baseless rumor.

388
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,467
Who do you think

389
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,700
pushed Kim Hae In from the rooftop?

390
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,067
I think I know.

391
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,133
Kim Hye In's dad is in the teacher's office.

392
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:07,367
What are you doing here?

393
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,133
You don't know, do you?

394
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,267
Your dad

395
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,600
is in the teacher's office,

396
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,467
cleaning the floor.

397
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:43,167
Please, just give my child one chance…

398
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,267
You're here.

399
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:47,000
- You darn leech.
- Ma'am, I…

400
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,667
Dad, what are you doing?

401
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,000
Get up. Come on!

402
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,067
My gosh. This is unbelievable.

403
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:55,900
Can't you assess the situation?

404
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,133
Even if you beg and kneel,
I'm not sure I'll forgive you.

405
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,467
Just once, please. My child's
future is on the line, ma'am.

406
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,367
Ma'am.

407
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,100
It's over.

408
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,800
Forget it. We're going to sue for school violence,

409
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,700
so have her expelled.

410
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,467
- Ma'am, what do you mean, expelled?
- Dad…

411
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:16,233
Where are you touching me? You're filthy.

412
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,800
Forget it.

413
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,567
I don't want to talk to you,

414
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,933
so go get your mother.

415
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,767
It wouldn't be enough, even if you all
gathered and begged on your knees.

416
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,567
Where is your mother?

417
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,900
Go get her!

418
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,900
I don't have a mother.

419
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,333
I said I don't have a mother!

420
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,533
My mom passed away!
Why would you call my mom? Darn it!

421
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,400
Hye In, wait a minute.

422
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:56,867
Hye In.

423
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:59,933
I know. I know how you feel,

424
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:02,867
but if you get labeled with school
violence in your current situation,

425
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:06,133
it will stay on your school
record for at least 4 years.

426
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,100
Then you wouldn't be able to take the GED

427
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,833
and you wouldn't be able to find a job in years.

428
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,333
Do you know what that means?

429
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,433
Hye In?

430
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,067
<i>Now I understand.</i>

431
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,067
Ma'am!

432
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,367
<i>This is my reality.</i>

433
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,400
<i>And this is my future</i>

434
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,400
<i>that will not change.</i>

435
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
I was wrong.

436
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,367
<i>I don't want to live like this.</i>

437
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,400
I was wrong.

438
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600
<i>Is being poor a crime?</i>

439
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,833
I was wrong.

440
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,367
<i>No.</i>

441
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:20,905
<i>I'll make having money a crime too.</i>
