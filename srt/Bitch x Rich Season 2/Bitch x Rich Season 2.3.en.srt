[This drama is fictional, and any similarity
with reality is purely coincidental.]

2
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:20,667
The new member of Diamond 6, Kim Hye In.

3
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,933
So you want to kick Do Un out and put Kim Hye In

4
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,800
in his place?

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,300
Hey, according to whose will?

6
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,133
Hey, Baek Jenna,

7
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,333
what did you just say?

8
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,633
I'm sorry,

9
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:00,867
but you'll have to leave.

10
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,267
No, I mean

11
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:07,967
you're saying you decided this on your own?

12
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,067
It's not as I please.

13
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,267
I'm just following the rules.

14
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:18,633
It's not the first time
we clean up like this, is it?

15
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,400
Hey, no matter what,

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,900
is Seo Do Un the same as Oh Si Eun?

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,333
Hey, Park Woo Jin,

18
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,300
will you stay quiet?

19
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,400
For a commoner who barely got in here with money.

20
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,367
Wow! Darn it!

21
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,367
Say that again.

22
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:41,133
I'm going to confirm directly with the chairman.

23
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:52,700
Oh, Do Un,

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,167
I was on my way to see you.

25
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:58,167
Being expelled from Diamond 6

26
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,267
was your decision?

27
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,000
I was going to explain it myself.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,033
Yes,

29
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:08,467
I understand you're feeling disappointed, Do Un.

30
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:12,267
Without the donation and the chairman's approval,

31
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:15,367
the reason you were able
to become a member of Diamond 6

32
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,933
was because you were the heir
to the school foundation.

33
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:21,633
This happened because of your father's mistake.

34
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,700
I just restored it to normal.

35
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,667
Well, the person who said he would protect me…

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
Wasn't it enough

37
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,433
to push my father out?

38
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,867
Push out, you say?

39
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,633
The former chairman

40
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,700
was dismissed due to his own mistakes.

41
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,467
Besides,

42
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,267
in a public place like the school,

43
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,533
don't act childish.

44
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,900
Rules?

45
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,533
Then, what about the donation?

46
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:14,133
There's no way she could have given
a donation at Diamond 6's level.

47
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,567
Don't worry.

48
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,100
Because the money has been paid.

49
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Hey, gosh!

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,300
So, where did an Equal Opportunity Leech
like her get such money?

51
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,133
Woo Jin!

52
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:26,200
She's a Diamond 6 now,
not an Equal Opportunity Leech.

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,967
I lent it to her.

54
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,700
Much more than what you paid.

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,033
Baek Jenna…

56
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,633
So, you do that kind of thing now too?

57
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:36,767
That kind of thing?

58
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,400
Hey, don't you get it?

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,033
If it weren't Seo Do Un, it would have been you.

60
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,467
Exactly!

61
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:53,400
You're one to talk, your own situation

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,200
must be a mess right now.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,067
Watch your words, everyone.

64
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,267
Stop being so vulgar.

65
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,567
Everyone,

66
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,500
do you like the new lounge?

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,833
Chairman,

68
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,333
this is not something Baek Jenna can handle alone…

69
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,000
Today, I was actually planning

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,433
to congratulate our student, Kim Hye In.

71
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,367
Has everyone finished greeting each other?

72
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,567
Get along well, everyone.

73
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,000
Check if there's anything else needed here.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,967
Yes, understood.

75
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,800
Then…

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,100
This is intense for the first day.

77
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,667
Did you get home safely yesterday?

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,800
The school is quite large.

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,467
Can I ask for some guidance?

80
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,533
I don't usually comply with others' requests.

81
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,067
Really?

82
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,800
But aren't we more than strangers?

83
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,933
We're engaged, aren't we?

84
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,933
Being involved with you

85
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,900
is quite unpleasant for me.

86
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,000
So, don't go around blabbing

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,367
about the engagement and all that.

88
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,800

will all be erased.

106
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,300
As a member of Diamond 6,

107
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,867
you need to take responsibility accordingly.

108

if someone doesn't notice
you've changed your hairstyle,

What? What are you talking
about? Misunderstanding?

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't misunderstand things like that.

00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,233
Hey, your hair…

192
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,467
What's the concept?

193
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,667
Mind your own business.

194
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,867
Alright, quiet, everyone!

195
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,267
Hye In? You're going to go up, right?

196
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:38,967
Ah, yes.

197
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,267
Look at that hair! From what I see…

198
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,567
- Somewhere…
- You all received this, right?

199
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,800
Excuse me…

200
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,100
Who was that just now?

201
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,900
She was from our school?

202
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,667
Oh, she's Hye In, with a 'ye'.

203
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,033
She transferred right after your accident.

204
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:04,267
Right after my accident?

205
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,200
Because your seat was empty.

206
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,800
She came in under the Equal Opportunity
Program and became famous

207
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,067
as a troublemaker in this school.

208
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,067
Everyone,

209
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:26,100
applying to the Ivy League is not just
about getting into a good university.

210
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,000
It's about proving your potential

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,833
and vision to the world.

212
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,533
[University Entrance Presentation]
If you look at the first page,

213
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,800
for students who find the next
year a bit burdensome,

214
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,233
in the current year…

215
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,000
The blue file.

216
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,167
Is that Equal Opportunity Leech a Diamond 6?

217
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,667
Hello?

218
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,967
<i>This is Choi Woo Hyuk from Gangnam police station.</i>

219
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,433
<i>The case of student Oh Si Eun</i>

220
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,133
<i>has been concluded as a suicide.</i>

221
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,967
What?

222
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,467
Then…

223
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,500
<i>The witness investigation has also concluded.</i>

224
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
<i>You can now focus on your academic life.</i>

225
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,867
Okay, thank you.

226
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:53,067
I've been cleared, and
the witness investigation is over.

227
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,167
Ah, well…

228
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh Si Eun's case

229
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,700
was concluded as a suicide.

230
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,733
That's good.

231
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,867
Congratulations.

232
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:09,567
I wonder if this is something
to be congratulated on, though.

233
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,767
Oh Si Eun, really…

234
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,567
Really what?

235
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,567
Never mind.

236
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,433
Hey, don't dodge.

237
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,367
Look. Look here.

238
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,400
Look! I said look, you dummy!

239
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:35,733
Darn it, don't dodge.

240
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,800
It spilled it all.

241
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,233
Gosh! Are you crazy?

242
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,067
Wipe it.

243
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,800
My shoes.

244
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,500
I spilled it because of you. So, wipe it off.

245
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
Have you really gone mad?

246
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,033
If you're confident, try hitting me.

247
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,133
Let go.

248
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,433
- Badge! Badge!
- What badge, moron?

249
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,533
The Diamond 6 badge.

250
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,367
You can't hit me, can you?

251
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,233
Since when

252
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,233
did you talk back

253
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:44,300
to Diamond 6?

254
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,167
In this school?

255
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,167
Should I say it again?

256
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,367
I told you to clean it!

257
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,633
You really came back here?

258
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,233
Huh?

259
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,467
Darn it!

260
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,633
Hey!

261
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,233
Amnesia?

262
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,067
Amnesia?

263
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,333
Who would believe that?

264
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,533
Are you kidding me?

265
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:21,133
Sorry,

266
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,900
but I really don't remember.

267
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,167
Do you know that?

268
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,867
The first time is hard.

269
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,200
The second time is nothing.

270
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:39,633
Whether it's a show or not, I don't care.

271
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,733
Leave this school within a week.

272
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,533
Got it?

273
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,367
If not,

274
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:49,000
every day will be

275
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,200
a living hell.

276
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,667
Just one week.

277
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,633
When I'm letting you walk out of
here alive on your own two feet,

278
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:57,433
just leave quietly.

279
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:59,267
Got it?

280
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm asking if you understood, you scum.

281
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Got it?

282
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,333
What are you doing?

283
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,367
If you're looking for a sex
partner, there's no need for it.

284
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,467
Should I call Kim Hae In?

285
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:36,233
Gosh, why are you like this?

286
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:39,167
I was trying to forget and move on,

287
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,533
but Kim Hae In suddenly appeared in front of me.

288
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,367
Because she keeps coming
and going, in front of my eyes,

289
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:49,267
I can imagine you guys together.

290
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,067
Yul Hee,

291
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:52,900
back then, I…

292
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,167
You know I'm really only thinking about you.

293
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,767
Why are you like this?

294
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,567
Oh, come on!

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,833
Park Woo Jin,

296
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,600
as your fiancée, this is

297
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,267
your last opportunity.

298
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:12,000
If my name gets tarnished again because of you,

299
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,967
we're done.

300
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:21,467
Gosh! Really!

301
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,567
Jeez, she went out.

302
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,800
Did you get your revenge properly?

303
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,533
It's not revenge.

304
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,367
It's punishment.

305
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,567
Don't you know what he did to me?

306
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,667
What?

307
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,100
Kim Hae In?

308
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,433
Yeah, Kim Hae In.

309
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,133
She has amnesia.

310
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:06,567
She came back from the dead and lost her memory.

311
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:08,467
Kim Hae In

312
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:11,033
lost her memory?

313
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,800
Let's go.

314
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,867
There's a place we need to go together.

315
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,500
Together?

316
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,800
Everyone

317
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,767
seems to hate me.

318
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,400
No,

319
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,833
after some time,

320
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:48,500
they will go back to normal.

321
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,733
Not remembering anything

322
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:55,533
makes me feel awful.

323
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:59,867
I don't even remember

324
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,600
that you were my boyfriend.

325
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,433
Sorry.

326
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,133
It's okay if you don't remember.

327
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,367
Just the fact that you're alive

328
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,600
is a great relief.

329
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,633
From now, future is important,

330
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,500
and we can do it together,

331
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,667
one step at a time.

332
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:34,667
Feel free to look around.

333
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,367
Pick something you like.

334
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,400
Let me see your taste.

335
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,300
8.6 million won?

336
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,067
You guys come to places like this

337
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,533
like you're just popping into a convenience store.

338
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,500
It doesn't suit you.

339
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,667
Don't look at the price. Just see if it suits you.

340
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,300
Does this color look good on you?

341
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,567
I was just touching it.

342
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,833
Don't think about the price.

343
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,167
Choose freely.

344
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,167
Really?

345
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,700
I tried it on,

346
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,100
but I'll put it back.

347
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,933
Hey!

348
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,933
Are you using your card today?

349
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:49,933
What?

350
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:53,500
You should start dressing to match Diamond 6.

351
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,967
<i>The life of Baek Jenna that I experienced today,</i>

352
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:22,567
<i>even while being in the middle of it,</i>

353
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,567
<i>felt</i>

354
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:27,667
<i>just like a dream.</i>

355
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,267
The gun is a bit weird.

356
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,733
Oh…

357
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,300
Oh!

358
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,167
Nice posture.

359
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,800
He just tried a few.

360
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,833
It's just a coincidence.

361
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:41,633
Yeah.

362
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,600
Another coincidence?

363
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,133
Coincidence.

364
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,900
I didn't know until I came here,

365
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,333
but this school is quite noisy.

366
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,567
Not these days.

367
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,800
This school is originally noisy and famous.

368
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,233
No.

369
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,867
Within six months, two
people fell to their deaths,

370
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,033
both at the same spot.

371
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,400
Ah.

372
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,067
One didn't die and came back to life?

373
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,433
Anyway, what's the reason?

374
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:14,200
Well, you'd know if you've heard the rumors.

375
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,500
Both are said to be suicides.

376
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,333
Don't you watch the news?

377
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:22,533
Why is everyone like this?

378
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,033
It's what's in the news,

379
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:26,167
all reported from the parents'
company headquarters.

380
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,733
It's a plausible copy-paste explanation.

381
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,200
I'm just curious.

382
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,633
They both died at the same spot.

383
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,500
Isn't it strange?

384
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,733
Wasn't someone pushed them?

385
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,467
That's ridiculous.

386
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:43,367
If so, what would be the reason?

387
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,167
Reason for killing…

388
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,000
No.

389
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,533
Reason for wanting to kill.

390
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,500
What the hell?

391
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,467
Was it only that?

392
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,467
Hey, Cha Jin Wook,

393
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:28,467
are you an illegitimate child?

394
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,067
Well, are you an illegitimate child?

395
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,267
Yes.

396
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,267
I'm an illegitimate child.

397
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,133
Why?

398
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:51,733
Woo Jin,

399
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:54,867
pulling this trigger isn't about finger strength,

400
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,367
it's human willpower.

401
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,800
Ah, this guy moves his hand at me
even though he's just a bastard.

402
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,633
Woo Jin!

403
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,933
Let go!

404
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,067
Yeah.

405
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:13,000
It must have been hard for you to deceive us, too.

406
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,500
Deceive?

407
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,533
Me?

408
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,367
When?

409
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,733
But, Woo Jin,

410
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,733
even if I'm a bastard,

411
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,967
do you dare to lift your head at me?

412
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,367
Right?

413
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:57,933
You and I aren't on the same level, are we?

414
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,033
Eat these two.

415
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,400
You bastard kid.

416
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,267
I'm going.

417
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,067
Hi!

418
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,633
Ah.

419
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,533
Hi!

420
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,800
Our names are really similar.

421
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,033
Ah.

422
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,567
Oh, they are.

423
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:56,333
I heard you came in through the same system as me.

424
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,800
How did you become a Diamond 6?

425
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,067
That's impressive.

426
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,000
Ah…

427
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:04,900
I got some help.

428
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,500
It's not that impressive.

429
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:20,700
Since you came in through the same system,

430
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,667
I thought we could become friends.

431
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,567
Ah!

432
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:38,033
Are you keeping what I gave you well?

433
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,633
What?

434
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,800
Don't you remember?

435
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:56,967
The necklace I gave you.

436
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,533
<i>Kim Hae In</i>

437
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>remembers everything.</i>
