00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,567
My son!

185
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,433
Do Un, why did you come here?

186
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:44,200
It's my first time seeing you since dropping out.

187
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,600
It's obvious what Hee Kwon's up to.
You must be having a hard time too.

189
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,800
It's okay.

190
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,367
I can handle it.

191
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,533
Don't ever back down.

192
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,067
Your future lies with Cheongjae Foundation.

193
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:10,167
If we let Hee Kwon play his games,

194
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,700
our foundation will be in danger.

195
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:17,567
I might not seem important now,

196
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:20,133
but I'll get my position soon.

197
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,267
But have you been

198
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,600
just fishing here, like this?

199
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,767
I don't know how to do it.

200
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,633
I'm just killing time.

201
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,333
Everything else is boring.

202
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:39,367
Someday the time will come.

203
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,567
Actually, that's why I came.

204
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,800
You definitely

205
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,133

00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,800
It's the weekend but you're working hard.

208
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,833
You're cold, aren't you?

209
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,867
No, not at all.

210
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,533
Let's get in the car, it's cold.

211
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,367
Let's get in the car.

212
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,933
The coffee is good.

213
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,267
It's tasty, right?

214
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:24,433

215
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,467
You have many good friends around you.

Don't you?

217
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:34,167
Is it because you're pretty?
Or because you're kind?

218

Dad,

219
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:47,267
if your daughter...

220
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,367
What about you?

221
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:55,033
Even if I disappoint you,

222
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:56,967
will you still

223
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,867
take my side unconditionally?

224
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,467
No matter

225
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,967
where you go or what you do,

226
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:15,067
no matter what you did,

227
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:18,267

231
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,133
congratulations!

232
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,500
From the bottom of my heart.

233
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
Wow!

234
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,433
My daughter looks exceptionally pretty today.

235
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:00,633
Jenna, you should accept the flowers.

236
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,867
You're all grown up now.

237
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:07,000
Remember this,

238
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,533
today is meaningful for you,

239
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:12,800

Remember that.

00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,867
Yes, Dad.

244
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,400
Don't worry.

245
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Shall we go find our seats?

246
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,933
You go first.

247
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:30,233
I need to talk with my stepmom.

248
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:38,321

00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,433
how dare you try to bring

Should I call this bold

256
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,367
or reckless?

257
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,333
Jenna,

258
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:19,500
I was wrong.

259
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
'Wrong' is an understatement

260

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400

00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,800
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

371
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,733
Oh, no need to thank me. I am the grateful one

372
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:45,167
for having a treasure like Jenna in our family.

373
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,000
Thank you!

374
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,433
As with family matters,

375
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:52,133
I believe we'll collaborate well in business too.

376
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,333
Of course, naturally!

377
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,933
Madam, you're truly radiant.

378
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,200
Thank you.

379
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,433
- Please, sit down.
- Yes.

380
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:04,367
- Hello, Chairman.
- Gods, Madam.

381
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:07,267
This is Madam Ahn Yoo Jin from Minje Daily.

382
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:10,400
This is Chairman Cha Ki Ho of Chasel Medic.

383
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,767
This is my wife.

384
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,267
Pleasure to meet you. I'm
Ahn Yoo Jin from Minje Daily.

385
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,733
Yes, nice to meet you.

386
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:24,733
Chasel is a major sponsor of Minje Daily, right?

387
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,067
Correct. Let's continue working together!

388
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:29,100
Of course!

389
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,267
By the way, Madam,

390
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:34,167
how are you so elegant?

391
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,733
Thank you.

392
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,367
Nice to meet you.

393
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:39,733
I'm Ha Min Hee.

394
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,167
You're here, Chairman?

395
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,667
Mr. Chairman, you're here.

396
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,467
Please take your seat.

397
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,867
- Please sit.
- Yes.

398
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,933
Allow me to announce

399
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,100
the ceremony will begin shortly.

400
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,567
Please, return to your seats.

401
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,533
Yes, despite your busy schedules,

402
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:21,733
we express our gratitude to all of you

403
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,967
who took precious time to celebrate

404
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,200
the beautiful engagement of the two.

405
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,633
Today is not merely a day...

406
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:28,833
What is this?

407
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,900
When two people promise their future together,

408
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,200
but also a meaningful occasion

409
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,733
where two families unite as one.

410
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,567
Yes, the protagonists are none other than

411
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:43,533
Hanmyeong Group's Baek Jenna
and Chasel Medic's Cha Jin Wook.

412
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:48,967
Please welcome them with a big applause.

413
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:56,533
Yes, the two are so beautiful and splendid,

414
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,933
making their entrance together now.

415
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:02,200
Let's have another round of enthusiastic applause!

416
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,667
Now, we shall formally

417
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,333
commence the engagement ceremony.

418
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,967
First, we'll hear congratulatory remarks,

419
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:19,100
expressing hopes for the couple's shared future.

420
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,433
Through Hanmyeong Scholarship
Foundation's Equal Opportunity System,

421
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,967
she entered Cheongdam International High School.

422
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:26,933
Baek Jenna's friend,

423
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,667
- Friend?
- Student Kim Hye In.

424
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,933
- This is bullshit.
- Please give her a big applause.

425
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,233
Hello everyone.

426
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:59,933
I'm here to celebrate my friends' engagement

427
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:04,667
as student representative
of Cheongdam International High School.

428
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,100
I transferred to this school

429
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,433
through the Equal Opportunity System.

430
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,667
Hey!

431
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,100
Hey, Seo Hee Su!

432
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,033
Seo Hee Su!

433
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:44,433
What's happening?

434
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:47,233
Haven't seen you in ages. Can't you calm down?

435
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,067
Even if we cut ties...

436
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,633
Ah, darn it!

437
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,833
What the hell!

438
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,667
They'll hear everything.

439
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,967
Let's talk somewhere else.

440
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,433
Darn it.

441
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,133
I said let's go talk elsewhere!

442
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,433
The truth is,

443
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,933
as a transfer student from a regular school,

444
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:41,733
the reason I could enter
Cheongdam International High School

445
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:45,767
is because Kim Hae In,

446
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,033
the original Equal Opportunity student

447
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:51,133
who tried to commit suicide
jumping from the rooftop.

448
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,800
But on that day,

449
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,733
when Kim Hae In fell from the roof,

450
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:03,067
I was also present.

451
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:06,833
And at that moment,

452
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,033
I saw the person who pushed Kim Hae In.

453
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,167
I was allowed

454
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:20,133
to enter this school under the condition

455
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,567
that I stay silent about
the culprit who pushed her.

456
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:27,567
And within Cheongdam International High School's

457
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:29,133
Diamond 6,

458
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:31,433
there is a murderer

459
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,733
who tried to kill Kim Hae In by pushing her.

460
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,767
The culprit who pushed
Kim Hae In is present today!

461
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,633
That criminal is none other than

462
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:47,133
a member of Diamond 6...
