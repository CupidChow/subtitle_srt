so it won't become a nuisance.

189
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,233
Aren't you taking the tray away?

190
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,933
Goodness…

191
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,367
Did you hear that story?

192
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,700
What story?

193
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
When Oh Si Eun died,

194
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,367
her phone disappeared.

195
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:58,533
And on it, there were videos
she used to blackmail other kids.

196
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,233
But among them…

197
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:02,067
Among them?

198
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:05,800
That…

199
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,367
What is it?

200
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:09,500
Why do you stop talking
in the middle of a sentence?

201
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,333
I was being blackmailed by Oh Si Eun too.

202
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,100
That pervert Lee Deok Min

203
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,133
told me to change clothes right in front of him.

204
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,967
So?

205
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,433
What?

206
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,300
So?

207
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,533
Hey!

208
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,100
Who do you think I made that video for?

209
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,233
To pay off the dress you ruined.

210
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,900
Because of that 8 million won…

211
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,700
That's why.

212
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,567
You took off your clothes
for a measly 8 million won?

213
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,233
To you, it might be just a measly 8 million won,

214
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,400
but don't you think I stripped

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,233
because that's how desperate I was?

216
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,033
What?

217
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:55,233
You're having a private conversation,
and I just barged in cluelessly?

218
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,933
Should I leave?

219
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,767
No need.

220
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,700
We're planning a party this weekend.

221
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,533
You'll come, right?

222
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,633
Do you want to come too?

223
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,667
Me?

224
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,667
I'm not really interested in parties.

225
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,367
Really?

226
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,600
The others seem to have high expectations.

227
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,800
Like, "let's see Cha Jin Wook's
scale" or something…

228
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
You'll come, right?

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,233
Fine, I get it. So go away.

230
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:26,700
We were in the middle of a conversation.

231
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,767
No.

232
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,267
The conversation is over.

233
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm off now.

234
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,467
That's unexpected.

235
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,667
You have friends too.

236
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,167
Friends?

237
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,567
What?

238
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,367
Did you hear that too?

239
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,467
This is Oh Si Eun's voice,
right? The laughing part.

240
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:52,967
Yeah, that's right, Oh Si Eun.

241
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,000
So creepy.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What are you talking about?

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,067
Why do we hear her voice here? It's scary.

244
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,100
Hey, listen.

245
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,567
This is 100% Oh Si Eun's laughter.

246
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,133
Right?

247
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,400
Crazy, did Oh Si Eun record this then?

248
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,367
Take this out.

249
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,933
Sorry, did I scare you?

250
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,467
You don't know me, right?

251
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm Park Woo Jin.

252
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,100
I have something to say.

253
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,067
Do you have a moment?

254
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:17,467
I wanted to talk somewhere quiet.

255
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:23,900
I was really surprised you came back to school.

256
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,967
I was really worried,

257
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,967
so I'm glad you're okay.

258
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:31,467
Do you maybe not remember me?

259
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,833
Yeah.

260
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,667
Sorry.

261
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,200
Then,

262
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,000
you don't remember this, either?

263
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,000
What are you doing?

264
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,500
What could it be?

265
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,567
You blackmailed me with the hidden
camera video you got from Oh Si Eun,

266
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,500
you dirty girl.

267
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,900
No, I…

268
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,333
I almost hit rock bottom because of you!

269
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,033
And you get the convenient out of having amnesia?

270
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,933
Do you really not remember?

271
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,567
You don't remember sleeping with me, either?

272
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,500
After we slept together,

273
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:32,000
I even bought you expensive things.

274
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,133
It makes me curious…

275
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,667
if I buy you expensive things now,

276
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,433
is it still possible?

277
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,767
Ah, what should I wear this weekend?

278
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:52,700
You look like a goddess no matter what you wear.

279
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,367
Goddess, my ass.

280
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,067
Just a girl, right?

281
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,300
Just a girl.

282
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
What?

283
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,133
Ah…

284
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:07,067
You're jealous because
you don't have to choose clothes.

285
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,267
Why doesn't Bo Seok choose clothes?

286
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,900
He found a partner for the party.

287
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,933
Oh, I see.

288
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,900
I thought you wouldn't come
because you'd be too embarrassed,

289
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,833
since the Diamond 6 member
Kim Hye In will be there.

290
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,667
Do you wanna die?

291
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,267
Hey, Equal Opportunity Leech,

292
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:29,500
when you see someone,
you should greet them before leaving.

293
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,800
Move.

294
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,067
Move?

295
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,267
Ah, these annoying leeches!

296
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,600
Did you both go crazy together?

297
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,000
Hey, just because Kim Hye In became
a Diamond 6, do you think you're something?

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,300
Oh, darn, really!

299
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,433
Hey!

300
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,133
You said it was amnesia.

301
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:53,300
For memory loss,

302
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,867
you need to stimulate brain cells.

303
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,233
Will that be enough?

304
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,200
Exactly, surely,

305
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,233
you have to do it strongly.

306
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,533
- Like this…
- Hey!

307
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,867
Stop it!

308
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,233
Let's go.

309
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,700
I have organized the dress for you to wear

310
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,733
at the party of Mr. Cha Jin Wook.

311
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:38,267
I've checked off the ones that
the kids of other esteemed families

312
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:40,667
are paying attention to.

313
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,767
This dress,

314
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,867
send it to Kim Hye In's house.

315
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,400
Yes.

316
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,067
Well…

317
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,500
Cha Jin Wook

318
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,100
is throwing a party this weekend.

319
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,533
Why didn't you ask me to go?

320
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,700
Ah, it's just that…

321
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,400
- me and them now…
- I want to go too.

322
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,567
As your partner.

323
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:29,867
They say we used to date secretly.

324
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,233
It was like that in the past,

325
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,700
but not anymore.

326
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,967
Hae In, you

327
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,867
still don't know, right?

328
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,767
What?

329
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,500
Never mind.

330
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,000
Alright, let's go.

331
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,700
Yes.

332
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,300
Why aren't you eating?

333
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,267
It's delicious, though.

334
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,167
Here.

335
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,533
- Isn't it tasty?
- Eat it all.

336
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,133
Shall we go?

337
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,933
Okay.

338
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,000
Wait a moment.

339
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,400
It's cold.

340
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,433
Thank you.

341
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:43,867
It looks good on you.

342
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,667
Let's go.

343
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:05,867
Hey, Kim Hye In!

344
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:06,933
Ah, I told you to knock!

345
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,367
- What is this?
- What?

346
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,600
I don't know. What is it?

347
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,900
Do you think I'm your delivery man?

348
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,467
What is it?

349
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,600
What is it?

350
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,467
Baek Jenna.

351
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:13,933
Do Un, can I go look in the mirror?

352
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,667
You can enter first.

353
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,700
No, I'll wait here.

354
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,767
Go and come back.

355
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:20,833
I'll be back quickly.

356
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,633
Okay.

357
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:39,167
Huh?

358
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,300
Seo Do Un,

359
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,800
you're here?

360
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
Yeah.

361
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,900
Wow!

362
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,333
This place is really nice!

363
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,333
How is it?

364
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,567
Do I look a bit weird?

365
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,333
Wow!

366
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,667
You can't find the old Kim Hye In anymore.

367
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:02,933
Old?

368
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,700
Are you insulting me right now?

369
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,900
No, it's a compliment this time.

370
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,233
Thanks.

371
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:11,033
Let's go together. Aren't you going in?

372
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,333
I came with Hae In.

373
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,300
I'm waiting while she went somewhere for a moment.

374
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,700
Ah.

375
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,933
Kim Hae In.

376
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,067
Hey, isn't that Kim Hae In?

377
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:27,133
Why is someone like that here? It's disgusting!

378
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:29,933
Ah, seriously!

379
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,600
So, you're out of your mind.

380
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,833
What makes you think you can come here?

381
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,633
Why? Can't I come?

382
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,600
I was invited too.

383
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,333
You were invited?

384
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,700
Ah, seriously!

385
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,633
What a load of nonsense.

386
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,433
I don't know who invited you,

387
00:24:06,433 --> 00:24:08,433
as a partner, or whatever…

388
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,233
Seo Do Un?

389
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,200
Are you really naive now? Really…

390
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,667
Hey, get a grip!

391
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,667
Seo Do Un isn't a Diamond 6 anymore.

392
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,633
His dad was ousted ages ago,
and you're still sticking around?

393
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,367
Moreover, that guy's dad

394
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:28,567
must be in a bad position, as he was
completely pushed out by his younger brother.

395
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,467
So what?

396
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,867
I don't care.

397
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:35,367
You don't care?

398
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,967
That's hilarious.

399
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,600
Hey,

400
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,867
I don't know what kind of
trick you're trying to pull,

401
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:43,567
but you should just live quietly.

402
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,933
It'd be even better if you
transfer to another school.

403
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,600
Park Woo Jin,

404
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,367
you don't know

405
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:08,600
who pushed me, do you?

406
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,333
Someone who knows

407
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,033
that you and I had sex.

408
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:18,467
Someone who knows that

409
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:21,167
and wants to kill me.

410
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,267
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

411
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,900
I wonder if you get it after I've said this much.

412
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:39,667
How is Hae In these days?

413
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,133
What do you mean, "how is Hae In these days"?

414
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:44,133
What does that mean?

415
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,967
Uh… well…

416
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:50,533
Does she talk about me,

417
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:55,067
or has her memory returned, or anything like that?

418
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,567
No.

419
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,933
Does Hae In recognize you?

420
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:05,067
No, what are you talking about?

421
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:06,367
There's no way.

422
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,767
I was just asking.

423
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,667
I'm off now.

424
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,133
Do Un.

425
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:19,600
Have you been waiting long?

426
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,333
No, let's go in.

427
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,233
Cheers!

428
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
What is it?

429
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,300
Hey, are you okay?

430
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,533
Hye In!

431
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,367
Would you like some champagne?

432
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,533
Lee Sa Rang,

433
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,400
I have something to ask you.
Can you step outside for a moment?

434
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,133
It's the first time we're properly
introducing ourselves, right?

435
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,367
Huh?

436
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,933
You transferred too, didn't you?

437
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:14,567
I heard it was really hard to transfer here.

438
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,633
I paid a lot of money to get in.

439
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,100
How did you get in?

440
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Besides,

441
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,133
even up to Diamond 6?

442
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
I just got in because a spot opened up.

443
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,767
What do you want to talk about?

444
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,000
Should we move somewhere else to talk?

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,967
- Sure.
- This party today is

446
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,967
hosted by Cha Jin Wook.

447
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:39,900
For a short while,

448
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,600
we will now begin the couple's dance event!

449
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:47,100
The winning couple

450
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,467
will be gifted the highest-quality champagne,

451
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,667
Cristal!

452
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,333
Now, make some noise!

453
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,500
Okay, the first couple,

454
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,633
please raise your hands!

455
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,033
- Me!
- There?

456
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:02,033
- Come here.
- Hye In, come out.

457
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:03,700
- What?
- Come out, now.

458
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,000
- Me?
- Let's go!

459
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,800
Why me?

460
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:09,967
Come out!

461
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:12,500
Wow, Sa Rang!

462
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,500
Wow!

463
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,300
Oh, it's hard!

464
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,967
See?

465
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,900
You can do it.

466
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,333
Those guys,

467
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,167
got so excited since that video of Black Dog

468
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,967
came out.

469
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,800
Did you see it too?

470
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:50,033
Black Dog?

471
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,767
Isn't it disgusting how they pretend

472
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:55,333
not to care on the outside but get all excited

473
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,433
about trashy gossip like that?

474
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,800
Are they crazy?

475
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,800
Hey!

476
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,333
Who wants to see something interesting?

477
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,533
<i>My video?</i>

478
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,033
<i>Then, did Oh Si Eun film this?</i>

479
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,000
This crazy girl…

480
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,833
Jin Wook,

481
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:39,200
your mother is really a beauty.

482
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,767
Looking closely, I see

483
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:43,733
you got your pretty looks from your mom.

484
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,233
This bastard is crossing the line.

485
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,533
You brat! Hey, say that again.

486
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,133
- Let go!
- Say it again!

487
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,233
- What are you doing?
- Say it again.

488
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,567
- Hey!
- Huh?

489
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:52,633
Come out.

490
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,433
What are you doing?

491
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:57,433
This bastard did this to me first.

492
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,900
I'm a bit late, right?

493
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:55,767
Let me introduce you, my fiancé, Cha Jin Wook.

494
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,167
That's right.

495
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,133
We're engaged.

496
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Don't be mistaken.

497
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,900
What, Baek Jenna?

498
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,933
You put the Equal Opportunity Leech in Diamond 6,

499
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,167
and now you're even engaged
to an illegitimate child?

500
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:26,400
How did you end up like this, Baek Jenna?

501
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:34,200
I don't think this is the time
for you to worry about me?

502
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:40,933
But, Yul Hee, you need to develop better taste.

503
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:46,667
Your eye for dresses is really quite poor?
