2010 ⬇️ 2004, Newlywed Time

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,750
This is too strong, so take it out.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,600
This is too hard on your stomach, so take it out.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,480
Everything else is okay.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,980
Okay.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,360
What are you doing?

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,230
I've placed the medicine you need in here. So take these.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,920
It's because if your body builds up a tolerance to it, then everything will be bad. Okay?

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,800
Honey, you're the only one who takes care of my body like this. You're better than a doctor.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,870
Of course. The doctor is the one who treats you for something that hurts right now.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,110
But, honey, I'm the one who'll be with you for the rest of your life.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,880
Right, right, right?

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,050
- Thank you.
- Ah, you don't have to be thankful over this.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,680
- You're a bit cool.
- Cool?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,100
2017

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,050
- You've been anemic these days.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,370
I took out the ones that cause anemia, so be sure to take them.

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,930
Are you listening to me?

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,620
Okay, I got it.

20
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,060
At some point, we take things for granted because they're shielded by familiarity and comfort.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,610
Hey, take that off.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,300
The wrist area was dirty. Come in quickly and change.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,740
No, I'm lazy. Wearing this twice isn't going to kill anybody.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,960
When others see this, they'll talk badly about you.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,330
I already washed this. Why are you trying to wear that instead? Come in quickly.

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,710
But, I'm late.

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,260
The generosity of my wife and happiness we're granted...

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,290
We lived thinking that's the way things were supposed to be.

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,710
Mom, come quickly.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,480
We're late, Mom.

31
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,910
But, the truth that is revealed after losing everything,

32
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,690
No one's existence should be taken for granted.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,980
Episode 10, Nothing should be taken for granted

34
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,690
2005 ⬇︎ 1999 Gangreung

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,210
What is this? You woke up early.

36
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,990
You're up now?

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,750
I felt like I was wasting time. I couldn't sleep at all.

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,770
Do you remember this place?

39
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,530
Well, yeah, a little.

40
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,620
Weren't there fireflies here?

41
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,380
Oh, there were?

42
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,600
You came looking for me yesterday.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,800
You seemed to have gone somewhere yesterday.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,640
Yeah. I was just walking around the neighborhood.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,190
The air is really nice. Whether it's because it's the countryside or the past.

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,250
Is this nice?

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,670
Yeah, it is.

48
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,050
Then, it's whatever.

49
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,360
What is?

50
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,370
Since you saw them anyway, it's okay. Since it's nice, it's okay.

51
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,220
Cheon Seol, what are you doing?

52
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,170
Oh? I was cleaning things up in the car.

53
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,590
You're meticulous as always. Thanks.

54
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,900
You were tipsy when I saw you yesterday. You didn't cause trouble, did you?

55
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,730
- When did I cause trouble?
- I'm not talking to you.

56
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,040
- Hey, before we leave, make sure you check your belongings to see if anything is damaged.
- What's he saying?

57
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,340
No...

58
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,340
What's this?

59
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,050
Before we leave, let's contact the others and... What's this?

60
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,030
What's with this? Star...

61
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,640
Star01

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,470
You guys are pitiful. I'll free you.

63
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,370
One.

64
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,340
Aigoo...

65
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,350
Cheon Seol.

66
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,880
I mean, I don't really know why I did this. I didn't do it on purpose!

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,430
What's wrong with you?

68
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,690
Come here!

69
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,880
Hey!!

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,970
They'll probably end up dating. They're meant for each other.

71
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,600
Then a girl like Cheon Seol would go to waste.

72
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,820
Hey!

73
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,550
That's true.

74
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,400
Hey. Did you not put a lot of effort into shaving?

75
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,610
Anyway, you're too impatient.

76
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,770
It's not that I didn't shave well. There are no six layer blades here. It's a bad blade.

77
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,080
People who can't do things right always blame the tools. Give me a break, six layer blade...

78
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,940
Jin Joo is caring for me like this.

79
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,260
Jin Joo! I'll shave better next time!

80
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,370
Nam Gil, we'll see you in school.

81
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,020
Get in quickly!

82
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,190
Drive safely. I'll see you in school.

83
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,780
Huh? Okay.

84
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,570
What's this?

85
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,510
We have a lot of baggage. I don't think you can fit in.

86
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,400
What are you saying? That baggage was in the trunk earlier. Hey, I was talking!

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,530
Jin Joo, there's a lot of baggage here. So, just comfortably ride in Nam Gil's care. Nam Gil, take good care of her!

88
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,170
Hey, what are you saying? What do you mean there's no room? Ma Jin Joo, just get in quickly. Why isn't there room?

89
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,230
Yeah, Nam Gil will get bored if he goes by himself.

90
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,500
- Keep him company.
- Uh?

91
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,710
What company? Is he a grandpa?

92
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,810
Ma Jin Joo, just get in!

93
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,900
Hey, why'd you take back baggage that was in the trunk?

94
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,630
Yea. Jin Joo could've fit here. The trunk is empty.

95
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,530
Geez, you idiots.

96
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,930
Aw, Cheon Seol. You did great!

97
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,170
She's a total cupid. She's born with it.

98
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,270
Jin Joo has to meet a good person this time and be happy. She's still young.

99
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,550
Right? This time.

100
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,440
Was there someone else in the past?

101
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,810
This place.

102
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,880
There's a lot of fireflies here. Right?

103
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,710
Should we just go now?

104
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,730
We have to drink now. The liquor.

105
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,520
Let's go to drink.

106
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,350
- Thanks.
- Pardon?

107
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,860
Thanks for coming along with me.

108
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:17,370
No worries... It's not good to drive a long distance alone. You'd fall asleep and get tired.

109
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,460
Thanks to you, I'm going back comfortably.

110
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,310
Uh. Is it clean for me?

111
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,830
Huh? What's clean?

112
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,200
I don't know if I shaved nicely.

113
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,950
Shaving? I'll look.

114
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,360
Yeah, it looks clean.

115
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,640
Really?

116
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,090
So, I did it well.

117
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,620
If you're tired, you can sleep.

118
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,730
If I sleep next to the driver, that's mannerless of me. You'll be sleepy, too.

119
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,690
It's fine.

120
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:15,440
A huge crowd gathered at Kimpo Airport this afternoon to greet King of Pop, Michael Jackson, who is visiting Korea.

121
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,610
Wow. That amazing person really came here.

122
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,680
I know.

123
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,400
They say it's rare for someone like him to be born once in a century.

124
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,370
The fact that we're living in the same time as him is amazing.

125
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,960
That's amazing?

126
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,080
To me, you're more amazing, Mom.

127
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,080
Aw, our daughter's been choosing to say really nice words lately.

128
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,780
♫  Billie Jean is not my lover. ♫

129
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,680
♫  She's just a girl who claims that I am the one. ♫

130
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,210
Like this.
♬  But the kid is not my son  ♬

131
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,670
Is it like this?

132
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,260
I think it's going to work out.

133
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,310
♬  Billie Jean is not my lover  ♬

134
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,170
- It's like this.
- Wow!!

135
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,160
Like this. Right?

136
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,390
Like this.

137
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,900
It's correct, right?

138
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,990
You're good.

139
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,520
It's not like that.

140
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,710
Then, like this?

141
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,150
Are you riding a bicycle?

142
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
You saw, right?

143
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Drink this before you go.

144
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,450
You're not using the blender. That makes it tiring.

145
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,030
Why did you peel all that? So much work.

146
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,960
If you blend all of it in the blender, it'll taste bad.

147
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,820
Besides, you guys don't eat with the skin on saying it's rough.

148
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,940
So, that's why I peeled them.

149
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,450
It's good.

150
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,420
It's good.

151
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,630
Eun Joo, have this before you go.

152
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,380
No, I don't want to. I'm not hungry.

153
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,140
Drink it. Even if it won't go down.

154
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,170
You need breakfast before you go.

155
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,850
- I said I didn't want to. What's with you?
- Oh, my!

156
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,040
That little...

157
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,650
- Mom, I'll be going, too.
- Okay.

158
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,670
Ma Eun Joo.

159
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,040
Why are you saying that to your unni?

160
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,490
Let's have a talk.

161
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,070
What?

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,740
Hey. What, "Ma Eun Joo?"

163
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,010
Are you not going to fix the way you talk to me?  (T/N: You are not supposed to call someone by their name if they're older.)

164
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,090
Okay, Unni.

165
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,410
Yeah. I'm your unni.

166
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,720
What did you want?

167
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,100
Can't you be nicer to Mom?

168
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I'm just worried about you.

169
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,130
What are you saying?

170
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,180
Do you think it's guaranteed that Mom will always be by our side?

171
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,520
There's no guarantee.

172
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,640
What's with you being like an old soul today?

173
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:40,350
In our lives, the person who will peel tomatoes using their own hands and make juice for us.

174
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,660
And the person who will make sure we have breakfast.

175
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,480
If we don't have Mom, there's no one else like that.

176
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,050
Do you think your husband will do it for you? Your child?

177
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,990
Hey. Are you worried that Mom will die?

178
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,600
In this world, there's nothing that wouldn't be able to happen to us.

179
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,740
Just don't regret it when the time comes.

180
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,600
Unni... what do we do...

181
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,780
Unnie.

182
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Unni.

183
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,730
What's with her today?

184
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,250
Time slip.

185
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,050
Earthquake?

186
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,810
Yes, not the earthquake record, but the forecast.

187
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,290
When there's going to be another earthquake in the Seoul area?

188
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,200
He's calling the weather agency, right?

189
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
This isn't Japan. In South Korea, when would there be an earthquake?

190
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:23,080
Wow... I thought his temper died down quite a bit recently. Maybe he's about to die. He's doing such a strange thing!

191
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,110
You don't know?

192
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,620
Okay.

193
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,340
Why is it that no one is prepared? There's no place on the earth which is safe from earthquakes.

194
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,810
They really won't come to their senses until something actually occurs.

195
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,980
- Where are you going? Class is starting.
- The library.

196
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,680
The library?

197
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,250
I think he's gone crazy.

198
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,810
From Galileo to Terminator, Physics through Star Trek, Time Labyrinth, Nothing is Impossible, The Future

199
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,670
Is time always flowing towards the future?

200
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,500
To time travel you have to bend space and time.
Possible time travel through the wormhole.

201
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,150
According to Stephen Hawking's scientific theory, you can turn the clock and go back into the past...

202
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,010
He expressed it as if you could adjust the time which has already passed.

203
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:08,490
He said you must bend space and time and go through the wormhole to travel through time.

204
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,600
What is this saying?

205
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,480
From Galileo to Terminator.

206
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,970
Butterfly.

207
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,350
Meow.

208
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,890
Where is it?

209
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,320
What are you eating by yourself?

210
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,130
Huh? Oh. Breakfast.

211
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,290
What about you? Breakfast?

212
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,730
I came here for a cat I know.

213
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,150
But, you're here today.

214
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,890
Oh, it's cat food? For a stray cat?

215
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,200
Yeah. Whether it's lost, or something happened,

216
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,190
it's always moving around and crying. Like someone I know.

217
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,970
Who?

218
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,220
♬  I’m thinking I’m in Love  ♬

219
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,120
Wow, your stomach is giving signs that you want to eat this.

220
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,340
♬  It is very sweet.  ♬

221
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,710
Here. You should have your own food first before caring about the cat's food.

222
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,040
No. I normally don't have breakfast.

223
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,970
♬  I’m fallin’ in love with you  ♬

224
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,450
I can't eat. Just eat this.

225
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,160
A student has to have breakfast. I mean a student who is studying.

226
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,660
It's not that I wanted to eat this for real. I'm eating this to show you my appreciation.

227
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,630
Yes, okay.

228
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,340
You should have it quickly.

229
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,270
♬  Open your closed heart.  ♬

230
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,080
- You're eating it well.
- It's good.

231
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,090
♬  Like that, I keep smiling.  ♬

232
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,090
♬  I'll approach slowly.  ♬

233
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,680
♫ You're not good at falling in love ♫

234
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,330
Are you feeling unwell?

235
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,980
No, I'm fine.

236
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,910
You can go first. Hold on.

237
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,270
What's the matter?

238
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:33,010
♬  Let me in your mind  ♬

239
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,470
Oh, she'll be suffering for quite a while.

240
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,130
Oh, my. It's not here.

241
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,760
Oh, my.

242
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,170
What do I do?

243
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,030
I'm in trouble.

244
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,400
Thanks.

245
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,890
- I want to go again.
- The ocean.

246
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,630
Grilled clams.

247
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,650
- Shrimp snacks.
- Oh, you.

248
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,220
Why are they not picking up? It's driving me crazy.

249
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,870
I'll have medicine for period cramps.

250
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,530
It works well.

251
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:01,480
She has a weak stomach. Give me the one with acetaminophen, not ibuprofen.

252
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,610
Hold on.

253
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,400
Thank you. Oh, one second.

254
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,800
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

255
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,110
Can you buy me one of those?

256
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,090
Okay.

257
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,660
Sanitary napkins

258
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,920
I'll have this, too.

259
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,950
This, too?

260
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,960
Okay.

261
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,550
Hold on.

262
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,290
This one doesn't have wings. Hold on.

263
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,650
- I'll have this.
- This one?
- Yes.

264
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,430
How much is it? Thank you!

265
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:06,210
Hey, isn't Choi Ban Do sleeping in the library because he wanted to skip class?

266
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,920
- Choi Ban Do's there.
- What's he doing there?

267
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,960
How did we end up sleeping in a construction site?

268
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,240
I know. I bet we're the first to do that.

269
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,420
Uh, Ma-Ma Jin Joo.

270
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,470
How will I go inside?

271
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,120
What are you doing? You pervert.

272
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,260
This a**hole... is he confused about his sexual identity... is this yours?

273
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:12,250
Gosh, why'd you suddenly push me like that? It's making me embarrassed.

274
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,000
That's... the one with wings.

275
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,450
What is this? A challenge?

276
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:34,580
Don't look at me like that. Ma Jin Joo's inside, so give this to her.

277
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
What?

278
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,430
That mysterious bastard...

279
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,780
Go Dok Jae. It's so embarrassing.

280
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,430
Does it hurt a lot? Do you want us to buy something for you?

281
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,280
No, it's okay. You guys go eat.

282
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,750
Will you be okay?

283
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,330
Then, you can rest here. We'll come quickly after eating.

284
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,870
Okay. You can eat slowly. I'm okay.

285
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,500
- We'll be going.
- Okay..

286
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,900
Hey, hey.

287
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,230
I knew you'd do this.

288
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,240
How many times do I have to tell you to take medicine with water?

289
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,230
Nagging like an old man.

290
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,880
Nothing compares to your nagging.

291
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,430
Are you okay?

292
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,710
No, it hurts so much.

293
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,370
Lean over.

294
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,630
Hey, it's fine. Someone's going to see.

295
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,290
Does it matter if someone sees? Did you commit a sin?

296
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,670
Should we kiss?

297
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,870
Are you crazy?

298
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,400
It has to be like this for it feel like you're committing a sin.

299
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,140
Anyway, you're such an old man.

300
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,830
Am I the only one? You're an old woman.

301
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,120
I guess your period cramps didn't go away even though you got younger.

302
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,510
Am I not a girl if I got younger?

303
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:06,200
That's true. It's not good if you keep taking medicine; you'll build a tolerance to it.

304
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,450
This chronic illness won't go away.

305

321
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,710
High schoolers these days are so pretty.

322
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,830
You're pretty, too.

323
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,610
What?

324
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,770
I mean, you got eighteen years younger. You're obviously pretty.

325
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,580
Hey, give me one cigarette.

326
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,410
- Are you not going to be quiet?
- Come quickly. You should carry some yourself.

327
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,130
I'm sorry.

328
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,940
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,340
I want to do my nails.

330
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,830
- Nails?
- Yeah.

331
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,110
Hey, this is awesome. I bought it. A success!

332
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,420
Those young bastards.

333
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,830
Hey, don't do it. It'll cause trouble.

334
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,820
- Let's just go.
- No, if they start doing that now, their lungs will rot.

335
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,380
Kids these days are so scary. You're someone with a family now.

336
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,740
If you just behave without fearing the world, it'll cause a lot of trouble.

337
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,370
If something bad happens to you, I'll be a widow. Remember that.

338
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,360
Hey, a widow? When you talk, you...

339
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,360
Okay, okay. Gosh, those young bastards.

340
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,330
Okay.

341
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,680
Wasn't that weird during the P.E. class?

342
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,450
It's like that every day. I'm the only one who gets caught all the time.

343
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,770
- Hey, take a break.
- You take a break.

344
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,690
Who cares if I have everything there's supposed to be?

345
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,610
I've never used it.

346
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,510
- You're lucky.
- About what, bastard?

347
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,530
You have a girlfriend.

348
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,250
- You bastard.
- What?

349
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,430
Why? Why'd you turn it off?

350
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,520
You just imagined it, right? Bo Reum isn't like that!

351
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,590
What about the item?

352
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,550
Tada!

353
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,170
What is it?

354
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,010
Let's watch it!

355
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,750
Now, it's not a video you see every day.
Singing Contest

356
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,790
Hey, are you ready?

357
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,650
Let's go.

358
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,040
All right...

359
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,030
Is it usually like this?

360
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,240
Aw, you guys are pure like little kids.

361
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,440
What's with you? Acting like you know everything?

362
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,170
I'm not acting. I know it all.

363
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:57,520
What's this? Have you really not done it yet, even though you have a boyfriend?

364
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,350
Ah, is it like the old-fashioned "waiting until marriage" idea?

365
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,830
Hey, no, it isn't that.

366
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,430
Is Yoon Bo Reum a cultural heritage or something? Protecting her?

367
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm going to protect her!

368
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,440
Geez, I couldn't even use it. S***!

369
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,210

Do you want to go to a karaoke place?

374
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,880
Right now? In daytime?

375
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,400
A noraebang place? I want to go!

376
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,740
Noraebang? I'm up for it!

377
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,350
Let's go! Noraebang!

378
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,540
Hey, you need to change.

379
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,460
Dad!

380
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,150
Let's go!

381
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,920
Ballet & B-Boying

382
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,930
What's this?

383
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,810
You know those B-boys I danced with in the streets before?

384
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,920
Yeah. That time when I pushed you to dance with them?

385
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,000
Those B-boys asked around and found me.

386
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,870
They want to perform with me.

387
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,690
Really?

388
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,650
How awesome. This is good.

389
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,530
I'll do ballet the ballet way, but as a hobby, I want to perform with them.

390
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,950
You should come see.

391
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,200
Of course. Of course I'll go.

392
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,730
I helped you with this. You can't forget it later on.

393
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,910
I know.

394
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,440
It's tomorrow.

395

[Ballet & B-Boying

396
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
Hello?

397
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,610
Ban Do, where are you?

398
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:31,140
Me? I'm going to see Min Seo Yeong's performance. Why?

399
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,460
Agh, Ahn Jae Woo's on a date, too. Go Dok is bored.

400
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,210
Bored, bored, bored!

401
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,010
Ah, that scared me.

402
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,230
Hello! You look like you're going somewhere.

403
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:54,900
Hello. Yes. Somewhere. Now. I'll be going.

404
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,420
What is this? Why's she following me?

405
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,240
Oh, right. You know Ma Jin Joo, the history major you were with?

406
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,700
Is she okay?

407
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,910
I heard from the other medical students,

408
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,260
but it seemed like Park Hyeon Seok found her and harassed her.

409
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,970
They say he hit her.

410
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,960
Yes! Noraebang!

411
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,020
So there are places that open in daytime.

412
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,150
- Why isn't Jin Joo coming in?
- Yeah, why isn't she?

413
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:47,240
Tada!

414
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,320
Liquor can't be missing when we're singing.

415
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,650
Oh, drinking during the day. Ma Jin Joo, you're the life of the party today.

416
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,300
A day like today doesn't come by every day.

417
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,250
You, too.

418
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,560
Mom, you should sing first.

419
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,840
What are you saying?

420
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,680
How can I sing in the middle of the day? My voice won't come out. I can't sing.

421
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,640
You should do it.

422
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,770
Honey, you can do it. Let's do a toast!

423
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,470
Here we go.

424
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,840
Cheers!

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,510
I heard it from other medical students.

428
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,590
That day, he found Ma Jin Joo and harassed her.

429
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,590
They say he hit her.

00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,800
This punk.

432
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,340
You think I'm truly an idiot for being taken advantage of by a jerk like you?

433
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,340
How dare you touch her! How dare you touch her!

434
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,780
Who?

435
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,120
Who?

436
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,280
It's a good thing you didn't make a mistake with Director Park.

437
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,740
That Director Park, does he still make you manage his mistress?

438
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,340
Well, yes.

439
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,830
It hurts!

440
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,700
I didn't do it on purpose.

441
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,580
Are you crazy? Where are you putting your hands?

442
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,460
Where are you putting your hands?

443
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,600
I really like you.

444

Director Park.

445
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,760
Keep doing this and I'll remove all of your medicine.

446
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,700
I apologize.

447
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,050
Do better.

448
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,600
I apologize!

449
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,480
How dare you...

450
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,090
Hey!

451
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,700
Let go!

452
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,880
How dare you!

453
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,480
I only got to sing once.

454
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160

Goodbye.

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:23,270
Ah, gosh.

457
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,070
- The favor I asked you earlier.
- Oh, yes. Hold on.

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,850
Right?

Fun Noraebang

462
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,230
Throughout life, it's my first time seeing someone crazier than me.

463
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,040
I'm sure there's something he feels guilty about and that's why he let it go.

464
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,580
I was thinking about how quiet you were being, but then you went and caused a huge accident.

465
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,580
Ban Do. He's someone who'll become a doctor later on.

466
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,370
He'll probably save thousands of patients.

467
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,940
How could you beat him up like that?

468
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,140
Whether he saves a thousand patients, or ten thousand patients,

469
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,980
why does it matter to me?

470
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,010
It doesn't matter to me either. I'm just saying.

471
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,450
Uh, did you get home safely yesterday?

472
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,040
Why do you carry around a phone if you're not going to answer it?

473
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,690
You called me yesterday? I didn't see it. Why?

474
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,570
Director Park.

475
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,470
Nevermind, it's nothing.

476
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,500
What about Director Park? Why'd you stop in the middle of talking?

477
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,160
Something came up so I called you.

478
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,130
I shouldn't have expected anything.

479
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,460
What are you saying?

480
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,790
I'm saying you were never there for me when I needed you.

481
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,330
Wow, Michael Jackson's so awesome. The performance was so great!

482
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,660
That's what I'm saying. When will he ever come back to perform again?

483
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,490
Will he come next year?

484
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,870
Is it closed?

485
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,850
Yeah, it is.

486
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,090
What do we do?

487
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,130
Are you not uncomfortable down there?

488
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,200
Yeah, I'm actually made for the floor. Floor physique.

489
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,350
Have you really not done it yet? You have a boyfriend.

490
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,510
Oh, is it the old-fashioned "waiting until marriage" idea?

491
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,200
What's this? He isn't even interested.

492
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:25,610
♬  Until the East Sea's water dries and Mountain Baekdu wears away, (T/N: Korea's National Anthem)

493
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:34,940
♬  God protect our land.

494
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,050
What's the matter?

495
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,570
I'm going to buy something really quick.

496
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,820
Where is he going at this time?

497
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,570
No way.

498
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,010
What do I do?

499
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,680
Ah, it's cold.

500
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,670
Oh, did you wake up because of me? Sorry.

501
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,230
Being a cheerleader is good, but you hurt your knees a lot.

502
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,270
Gosh, so cute.

503
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,560
Mom's voice

504
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,210
To my dear mom

505
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,880
Mom's voice

506
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,280
What's this?

507
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,020
Grapes.

508
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,940
Am I asking because I don't know?

509
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,120
Why am I in this shape?

510
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,540
For me, why...

511
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,600
Why doesn't anything work out the way I want it to?

512
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,630
There wasn't even one time,

513
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,220
I've never been insincere.

514
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,670
I tried so hard.

515
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,640
Just like 10 years ago today, everything is a mess.

516
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:08,340
Taxi!

517
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,670
Goodbye!

518
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,020
- Deputy Choi!
- Yes!

519
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,660
Bring medicine and visit my hospital.

520
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,200
Are you being serious?

521
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,700
- I'll be going.
- Thank you!

522
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,530
Salute!

523
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,780
Goodbye!

524
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,770
Yes!

525
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,880
Rock, paper, scissors.

526
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,540
What are you doing?

527
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,110
These little...

528
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,630
Hey, give me a cigarette.

529
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,290
Hey, punk! You bastards.

530
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,250
You, the one who fell over. Come over here.

531
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,160
Come here, it's okay. Come.

532
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,210
Look at him!

533
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:06,720
Are you okay? Go home quickly.

534
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:12,310
You bastards learned bad things and harassed a friend.

535
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:17,820
Whether you drink or smoke, it's your body. So, do whatever you want.

536
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,390
Don't harass a friend.

537
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,040
If he's drunk, he should just go home quietly. What the heck?

538
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,200
What is he?

539
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,760
Hey, honey.

540
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,340
Choi Ban Do, come quickly.

541
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,860
Ban Do, come quickly.

542
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,430
Okay. I'm going now.

543
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,230
Hey, old man. Let's have a talk.

544
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:46,960
- Hey!
- Stop right there!

545
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,840
Hello?

546
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,360
Get him.

547
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,210
Hello?

548
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,260
Hello? What's wrong?

549
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,710
What's wrong, honey?

550
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,940
What's wrong? What do I do?

551
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,630
Excuse me. I just want to have a quick talk.

552
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,750
Detective, I have to go right now.

553
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,200
It's a mutual offense. You can't go.

554
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,960
Detective, I have to go now. Please.

555
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,880
Oh, man, seriously. What are you doing? Drag him out.

556
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,390
I really have to leave!

557
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,850
Detective, I have to go!

558
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,350
Detetive, I really have to go.

559
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,730
Let go!

560
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,930
Let go!

561
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,010
Why are you like this?

562
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,220
Why are you doing this?

563
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,770
Why?

564
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,130
Because of you,

565
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:17,060
my mom left without seeing my face.

566
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:43,870
I apologize, Mother-in-law.

567
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,490
I apologize.

568
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:49,150
I apologize.

569
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,320
I'm sorry...

570
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:23,960
I tried my darndest to live a good life.

571
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,290
Why am I always sorry...

572
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:40,590
Like you, I wanted to see Mother-in-law.

573
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,330
I wanted to see Mother-in-law, just like you!

574
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,950
What is he saying?

575
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,770
Mom.

Epilogue
 The king of pop, Michael Jackson, died today in his home on June 25.

578
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,700
Ten years ago today on June 25, 1999,

579
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,280
he held a concert in Korea.

580
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,150
The attentions of Korean fans are given.

581
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,890
Michael Jackson dies suddenly. Shocking!

582
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,690
When my mom, who was the universe to me, disappeared,

583
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:01,880
The world was going around so well with other interests.

584
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,660
♬  Leaving me,  ♬

585
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:10,090
My grief seemed to be buried so unattended and ordinarily like that.

586
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,150
Even to the closest person to me.

587
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,800
