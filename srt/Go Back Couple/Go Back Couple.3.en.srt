♬  Come here self-assured girl! Get out of my way. ♬

5
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,290
Hello?

6
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,150
I can't hear you. I'll call you when I'm outside.

7
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,670
No, I'm just bored.

8
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,820
Okay, have fun.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
She's always at the nightclub.

10
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,240
I'm just going to eat.

11
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,250
Subtracting money for the loan..

12
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,130
Maintenance fees..

13
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,040
Wow. It's going to be father-in-law's birthday soon. My paycheck even combined with his is not enough.

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,520
There isn't a day when there's enough money for these living expenses.

15
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,260
A lot of money was spent.

16
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,630
They say that people have rights they can enjoy at certain times.

17
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,510
Hey, friends. Are there two of you? Us, too.

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,120
During the teenage years, you have the right to see beautiful things instead of the bad.

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,020
Hello, manager! I'm Choi Ban Do, the new employee from Korean Medicine.

20
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,890
Please look at our medicine. It's made with good ingredients.

21
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,980
Can you look at it just once?

22
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,060
And, during the twenties,

23
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,130
you have the right to enjoy your youth.

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,880
The youth that everyone intensely enjoyed...

25
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,630
For us, we missed it like not being able to see

26
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,670
flowers during a spring day.

27
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,980
Episode 3: The Spring Day We Found Again

28
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,360
(Seoul, 1999) Youth is like a spring flower that

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,330
blooms and closes right as you blink.

30
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,380
Before your youth passes by,

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,280
you should just do what you want.

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
Whether that means playing or going on vacation.

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,140
This is Bug's  Barefeet Youth.

34
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,800
♬Being like this having both connections and visuals, for now, if you subtract youth, you're just a dead body  ♬

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,720
The appetizer's here!

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,930
You like to drink quickly, don't you?

37
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,310
I'm going at a slow speed right now.

38
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,770
Very slow.

39
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,710
Don't try to match my speed. Drink at your own pace.

40
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,140
I'll pour it for you.

41
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,690
- What are you doing?
- What?

42
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,860
You shouldn't pour for a girl, nor should a girl pour for you.

43
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,860
Everyone should do it by themselves.

44
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,930
Themselves

45
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,670
♫  I don't know if I'm drunk. ♫

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,320
♫ I don't know if it's a mistake. ♫

47
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,730
♫  When it's morning I can't think of anything. I might be anxious. ♫

48
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,060
This song.

49
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,750
It sucks.

50
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,600
Huh?

51
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,190
He's just saying he'll say whatever he wants since he won't remember when he's sober.

52
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,860
If it's disadvantageous, they'll choose to forget it. Is it alcohol, Alzheimer's or what?

53
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,340
Don't you think so?

54
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,830
You're right. I don't like it, either.

55
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,230
I really don't like it when people try to pretend they don't remember something. I don't do that.

56
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,010
How do I know that? It's our first time meeting.

57
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,500
You should drink slower. You might get drunk fast.

58
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,930
Cartilage! Buy me cartilage.

59
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,630
Come here! Come here!

60
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,830
What the! So unlucky.

61
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,320
Ugh! I'm going to kill you.

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,700
You're a heavy drinker.

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,550
Boys' Dorms.

64
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,190
What is this? Hey! Wake up.

65
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,800
Get up! Why are you sleeping here?

66
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,180
Why am I here?

67
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,370
What is this?

68
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,270
What? Oh... Mom!

69
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,520
Mom! Look at her eye infection.

70
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,190
Hey, don't look at me.

71
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,760
You idiots. You're causing a scene early in the morning.

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,660
Ugh, you.

73
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,840
What is this? Why am I the same?

74
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,700
Yes!! Yes! I didn't go back!

75
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,340
What if it spreads to me? I have a meeting tomorrow for my major.

76
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,280
Why does she have a gross eye infection?

77
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,170
Hey! Don't get close to me!

78
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,250
What's up with her?

79
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,920
And why did she sleep in your bedroom?

80
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,610
And what's with her eyes?

81
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,550
The children I have do not even know how I feel,

82
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,270
so how would I know how you guys feel?

83
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,150
"To my dear mom"

84
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,320
Jin Joo. Is something wrong?

85
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,680
Are you upset because of me?

86
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,810
There's nothing like that.

87
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,940
Oh, also, do you need some allowance?

88
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,850
I don't.

89
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,150
Did puberty come to her overnight?

90
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,950
Why is she doing that to only me?

91
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,580
So this means I don't know when I'm going back.

92
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,990
I don't know.

93
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,770
Wait, I have to serve in the army twice.

94
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,600
Wait, no. It's better than being a divorced man.

95
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,690
I don't know, I don't know.

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,570
Look at this.

97
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,590
He once knew how to enjoy life.

98
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,900
What did you just ask for?

99
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,650
Mom, Dad. Get me the installment savings and the house deed.

100
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,420
And our assets.

101
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,160
All of it.

102
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,650
This young, little bastard! You're already doing this?

103
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,590
I'm not a young bastard.

104
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,580
With that money, I'll multiply it and make you rich.

105
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,320
I will be a good son.

106
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,120
With that money, if we invest into Gwanggyo and Pangyo,

107
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,030
we'll have money to live off of for the rest of our lives.

108
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,890
How do you know that?

109
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,660
How many times do I tell you? I'm from the future!

110
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,280
Oh, I have an answer for this.

111
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,550
Oh, darling! Choi Ban Do, you!

112
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,880
Dad, this isn't a time for you to be grabbing the back of your neck.

113
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,820
You'll live as a rich man for the rest of your life!

114
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,980
I'll make that money that you can't earn with your salary.

115
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,380
Bring it quickly.

116
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,630
Oh, this little...

117
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,990
Where are you going?

118
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,440
Oh, it's all in your bedroom?

119
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,570
Dad! Bring all of it!

120
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,270
Mom, should we get a loan?

121
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,880
You must be crazy.

122
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,390
Hey! Did you get taught something from a con artist?

123
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,790
Just wait. You'll see what I mean.

124
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,310
Nothing great. You're not going to do anything great.

125
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,320
Hey punk!

126
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,920
Did I ever let you go hungry, or miss a tuition payment with my low income? Huh!

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,000
Ahhh! Darling!

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,820
Choi Ban Do come here, huh?!

129
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,970
Bring all the assets? How dare you!

130
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,450
Dad just trust me!

131
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,450
I can't imagine how grateful I was when you were born and I even boiled seaweed soup for your mother.

132
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,490
I can't imagine why either.

133
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,880
Don't get angry at me. Just believe me, seriously.

134
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,860
Believe you, punk? How?

135
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,280
What?

136
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,940
He is probably going to be causing trouble.

137
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,870
Dad. He probably already did.

138
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,440
Ah! Youth feels so nice.

139
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,990
Ready! Go!

140
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,600
🎶

141
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,040
Mister stop! Stop the bus! Stop. Stop.

142
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,180
Yay! I won!

143
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,660
Hey!Choi Ban Do!

144
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,160
I won!

145
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,340
I need to meet Choi Ban Do first.

146
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,380
There's no one who gives a card to a taxi.

147
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,070
It worked yesterday. Why doesn't it work?

148
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,780
Where would I even charge your card? Is this a department store?

149
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,580
Young lady. Young lady, you're not a hardened criminal, are you? Hurry up and pay!

150
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,440
No. It definitely worked yesterday.

151
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,390
Oh my god. Where did my wallet go?

152
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,330
This lady, really!

153
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,740
Just wait! I really don't have cash.

154
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,100
Oh my. It's here It's here.

155
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,420
Now I understand.

156
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,670
Just let me go. Just let me get that taxi driver!

157
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,930
What is this?

158
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,450
Dad will tell Mom to buy you a cell phone.

159
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,600
Ah I don't care!

160
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,960
Where did Choi Ban Do go?

161
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,140
Salute!

162
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,800
Hello!

163
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,380
Oppa! You seem to be heading to your class...

164
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,770
I didn't want to have to see him this morning

165
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:31,530
I greeted him after rejecting him in such an awful way. I must have seemed to be a crazy neighborhood lady.

166
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,710
He must've thought I was crazy!

167
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,950
- What are you doing?
- Oh my god, you surprised me!

168
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,720
You're uncomfortable, right?

169
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,310
You must not be from the future today.

170
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,650
Go. What if he see us here?

171
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,620
What are you guys doing here?

172
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:00,130
Hi. I'm the guy from yesterday. Go Dok Jae. That's An Jae Woo.

173
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,200
But don't girls usually chat near restrooms?

174
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,360
Why are you chatting near the trashcan?

175
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,330
Go!Go!

176
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,940
Salute!

177
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,720
What's with your outfits?

178
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,510
Are you supposed to be Bruce Lee?

179
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,740
It's our major's uniform. Pickled radish color.

180
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,790
Pickled Radish? Simple, dumb, insane?

181
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,760
- Good sense.
- I'm guessing that's from when you got beat up yesterday?

182
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,580
- That's exactly right!
- Oh yeah, I saw.

183
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,210
- You should have done something then.
- Why would I?

184
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,410
We're leaving first.Let's go.

185
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,280
You! I'll see you later.

186
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,960
Me?

187
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,430
Why me?

188
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,020
Where is Choi Ban Do?

189
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,750
As expected, Min Seo Yeong. Your fanclub is here again!

190
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,560
Omg, it's Min Seo Yeong!

191
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,570
But he didn't come today, the psycho.

192
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,460
Oh, the civil engineering major?

193
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,490
Oh he is here. He came.

194
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,770
I'll do it, today!

195
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,770
She already saw you... Why did you hide?!

196
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,300
Hey! He's coming!

197
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,170
That's Min Seo Yeong. She is exactly how I remember her.

198
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,280
Like a fairy.

199
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,880
Even if you go back in time, you won't be able to seduce her.

200
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,960
If I go back, of course I would seduce her. I wouldn't date Ma Jin Joo again.

201
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,550
That's right. I couldn't date her in the past but, it's different now.

202
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,320
Look Min Seo Yeong, the psycho is back.

203
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,560
He isn't wearing his uniform today.

204
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,350
He's coming!

205
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,300
Hello!

206
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,790
Yes.

207
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,580
I'm sorry about yesterday. You must have been surprised. I also don't know why I did that.

208
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,140
My name is Choi Ban Do. I'm a freshman in the civil engineering department. Oh, wait a sec.

209
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,710
Drink it well.

210
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,850
Oh..thanks.

211
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,040
This... here.

212
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,820
So they can have some too.

213
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,340
See you later.

214
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,500
Will you give me your number?

215
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,260
Next time, I want to greet you as a friend.

216
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,220
Stop lying!

217
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,020
You couldn't gather the courage to talk to her for months. This is all a lie.

218
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,850
Give me that!

219
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,260
Okay...try calling her!

220
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,710
You didn't know we'll do this right? What will you do?

221
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,640
Hello? Who is this?

222
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,150
Hey!Hey!....It's her!!!

223
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,740
Wow!

224
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,440
So cool!

225
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,290
Hey, you, you, you!

226
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,230
What?

227
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,320
You seriously ... you seriously did this?

228
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,780
You were able to ta..talk, to to ..her, when you normally can't talk to her?

229
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,290
Why are you stuttering? How else would I have gotten it? Sign language?

230
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,210
I am telling you the me now is not the me back in the day.

231
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,740
With age, I've gotten wiser. I also have a young body that is as strong as...

232
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,370
Iron Man's armor.

233
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,850
What are you talking about? What was... Ok fine.

234
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,910
What about a confession?

235
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,950
Yes, yes, did you do that? Confess?

236
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,060
What are you guys talking about? What confession?

237
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,470
Even in love, they say there are stages that must be passed first.

238
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,230
Bro, is Min Seo Yeong out of her mind?

239
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,980
She has a whole list of guys that want to date her.

240
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,430
Just go tell her you like her and get this over with.

241
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,510
You guys are saying some weird things.

242
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,370
Why would I confess my feelings if I am not going to date her?

243
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,320
You should only confess to a girl when you know you have a chance with.

244
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,970
You know nothing about dating. Idiots!

245
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,380
Know nothing? Know nothing!

246
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,450
Hey! Have you seen me when I wake up? Have you seen me upset?

247
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,440
Shut up, you are embarrassing me.

248
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,650
We aren't inadequate!

249
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,850
It hurts. Why am I talking to these kids?

250
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,610
I should not talk to them.

251
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm feeling down after that.

252
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,920
It's so bitter. Why does my mom keep giving me bitter things?

253
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,720
My mom is so mean.

254
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,250
Hey! Why would you throw this away. Do you not know how good this is?

255
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,850
Give it here, I'll drink it.

256
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,180
Hey, Ma Jin Joo was looking for you.

257
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,850
Ma Jin Joo? For me? Why? Forget it.

258
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,450
She is just doing this to pick at what I said.

259
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,500
She always been gutsy.

260
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,240
I'm hungry. Let's go out for tteobokki. (spicy rice cakes)

261
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,110
Hey!

262
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,880
Oh!

263
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,950
Hey! We need to talk. Come with me.

264
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,440
Aigoo, class is going to start. We need to get ready, hurry, hurry, hurry.

265
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,140
I said come out with me. I have something to say.

266
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,410
To me? You have something to talk about?
I have nothing to talk about.

267
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,150
Hey!

268
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,950
Class is going to start. Take a seat.

269
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,330
Go.

270
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,400
We'll talk later!

271
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,420
Did something happen? She wasn't upset earlier.

272
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,290
Oh my, she is scary. Seems like laser beems are coming out of her eyes.

273
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,950
Don't worry about it.

274
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,230
Perhaps, she has anger issues? Something like that?

275
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,220
Anger issues? What's that?
A condition where you can't handle your anger.

276
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,620
Don't get your life entangled with mine.

277
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,840
It's starting.

278
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,450
In the paper that is getting handing out right now, write

279
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,130
your observations on a person in the class.

280
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,870
What are they thinking?

281
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,890
What is on their mind. This is an anonymous project.

282
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,080
Observed classmate :

283
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,210
Choi Ban Do

284
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,380
You all got your own papers right?

285
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,070
Yes.

286
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,810
This is how others see you.

287
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,600
How do you feel?

288
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,280
Go Dok Jae:

289
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,710
Do you think you are in a rock band? Disgusting, fake hair, ,

290
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,750
Get a hair cut and join the army.

291
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,270
Aigoo, seems that friend is shocked.

292
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,560
Choi Ban Do: Poophead, stingy with money, coward. Tightwad,Tightwad, Tightwad,

293
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,890
Tightwad, tightwad, tightwad!

294
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,250
- What is this?
- Why don't we talk for a bit.

295
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,360
Aigoo. We will be late for class.

296
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,260
We have something to talk about.

297
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,380
We do? I have nothing to talk about with you.

298
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,150
You really! Come with me.

299
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,610
Ouch! That hurts!

300
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,990
What is that?

301
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,960
Is that was is called "crazy love" or something like that?

302
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,370
What's going on?

303
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,860
I don't know.

304
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:50,440
Wow! You really had me deceived.

305
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,820
You should become an actress. You are better than Jeon Do Yeon. You should give it a try.

306
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,020
Should I?

307
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,560
Why you little! Forget it.
Since when did you know?

308
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,750
You were going to go around pretending you don't know. You are seriously a scary woman.

309
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,900
I am the one who should be saying that!

310
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,390
"You should study." "Gold Miss?" Did I torture you?

311
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,250
You are the one who ate me alive! You tightwad.

312
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,370
Wow! so scary.

313
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:29,250
It is so scary to hear these things come out of that face. It's so terrifying.

314
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,130
What are you doing?

315
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,250
Can't you tell?

316
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,900
I am consoling myself for living so long with such a scary woman.

317
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,920
So petty!

318
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,190
I was always petty. Do you know it now?

319
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,820
Why, why, why? Is it the first time you see a petty man?

320
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,620
Forget it. What is going on? Why did we come here?

321
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,840
How am I supposed to know?

322
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,550
I thought I'll go back after sleeping,

323
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,020
I thought it was a one day thing, but I didn't go back.

324
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,820
I don't know if we will stay here forever.

325
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,460
Forever!

326
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,880
I would be thankful.

327
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,650
What?

328
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,990
Everything would be terrible if we went back. Think about it.

329
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,290
We went to bed and woke up to a nice surprise.We went to sleep and woke up. We are young. We are twenty year olds. Big thank you!

330
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,420
If we go back we are a divorced man and woman.

331
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,970
And are very old. Do you want to go back to that?

332
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,350
Who said I want to go back?

333
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,080
Exactly.

334
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,580
Since it turned out this way, I will just live my life.

335
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,150
Let's just live our lives as strangers. We don't want to mess with each other, right?

336
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,620
We don't want to mess with each other, right?

337
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,210
Of course, that is what I want to say.

338
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,360
Exactly. Alright.

339
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,190
Good bye, young lady.

340
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,920
Yes, good bye.

341
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,420
Fighting!

342
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,510
What is this? We both came back together? Why?

343
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,330
Was I too much?

344
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,560
Let's get divorced. We are too unhappy.

345
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,500
I am very upset.

346
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,790
Whatever, it's better this way. She said she was unhappy.

347
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,590
Now that it turned out like this, I'm just going to live my life.

348
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,260
Let's just live as strangers.

349
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,850
If I get to be young again, I would have no other wish.

350
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:41,750
It sounds like nagging to you guys. But when you get to my age you will understand.

351
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,920
You get to do all that you want.

352
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,920
This time never repeats itself.

353
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,290
Youth will not wait for you.

354
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:58,750
Alright, write up a bucket list for things you want to do.

355
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:15,720
Bucket list

356
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,550
Hey! Hey! Let's go play.

357
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,360
Why are you just sitting here?

358
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,210
We are playing right now.

359
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,530
No one has as much time as we do.

360
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,250
What's wrong?

361
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,290
I mean let's go out and do something.

362
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:42,320
Ugh, I've been tired since my morning classes.

363
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,650
These young ones!

364
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,180
Tired? You guys think your strength and fitness will last forever, right?

365
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,070
Ok, what do you want to do? Tell me.

366
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,940
What do kids do these days?

367
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,990
Why do you talk like that? Are you Seol's mom?

368
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:06,850
Mom, kids nowadays go out to drink in,

369
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,980
Nightclubs.

370
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,550
Nightclubs?

371
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,490
I want to go.

372
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,130
What? You want to go to a nightclub?

373
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,690
Yes. Those nightclubs that you hang out at every night.

374
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,040
I only went twice.

375
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:30,680
Wow. She said she would not go even once. This is the biggest deviation dreamed of in Ma Jin Joo's 20 year life which will wallop the world.

376
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,340
Then, just once

377
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,090
shall we go for it?

378
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,330
I told you we should've worn lower heels!

379
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,050
I wasn't expecting a downhill path.

380
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,770
Let's go.

381
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,070
Hey! Hey! Omo!

382
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,600
Move, move, move.

383
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,450
Move.

384
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,970
Omo, move! Move!

385
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,090
You there, move! Move!

386
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,970
♫ I'm thinking I'm in love ♫

387
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,580
♫ You woke up my heart that had stopped ♫

388
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:29,130
♫ You are very sweet ♫

389
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,710
You should get off me now. Since I smell.

390
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,600
♫ In the light of your beautiful eyes  ♫

391
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,690
♫ I'm thrilled. I won't hide it now ♫

392
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,830
This is my first time wearing such high heels...

393
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,570
It's too steep right?...but you don't smell-

394
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,350
♫ Open the closed heart ♫

395
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,940
Should I...

396
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:06,140
I am sorry.

397
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,510
What is she really!

398
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,610
Why did he have to be standing there of all places?

399
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:20,840
That's what I say. This is not a matter of opinion, it's true, really.

400
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,670
That was coincidence. We should stand there too.

401
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,380
That is a good idea.

402
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,740
♬  Come back to me. Come back to me.  ♬

403
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,970
♬  Come back to me. I did everything wrong.  ♬

404
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,950
He's really handsome.
♬  Don't stop talking to me anymore.  ♬

405
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,060
What is the occasion that made you come to a nightclub?

406
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,970
If not now, when would we come?

407
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,890
Exactly, if not now, when would we come? We should live every day for that day.

408
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:14,850
Hey!Seol ..don't wear your glasses, you're prettier without them!

409
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,580
You put on some make up!

410
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,020
I am! Hey!guys this is your dark history...right?

411
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,130
What? Dark history?

412
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,330
What is she saying?

413
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,690
We did we walk around like that back then?

414
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,850
Everyone did their makeup like this

415
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,550
I know... All the pictures from back then are all like that.

416
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,510
When I was 20 years old how could the photos be more important than the present. You look older.

417
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,270
That's our dark past.

418
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,640
♬  Come back to me. Come back. ♬

419
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,890
♬  Come back to me. I did everything wrong.  ♬

420
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,810
♬  Don't stop talking to me anymore. ♬

421
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,220
♬  Come back to me. (Come back to me) ♬

422
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,340
Yes, did you call?

423
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,710
Hey! Put that down. That is to call a waiter.
Do you want to announce that you never came here before.

424
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,670
Ah! This is your first time..then why don't you try booking?

425
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,590
Booking? Let's go!

426
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,700
Her attitude is refreshing. Good. Let's go!

427
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,420
Okay. Let's go.

428
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,370
I only came to dance today.

429
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:35,430
Then why would you come to a nightclub alone?

430
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,290
Come this way.

431
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:47,640
Yeah, I'm still at the library. Just because I'm in med school doesn't mean I'm a doctor yet.

432
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,530
I should study hard and spend a sleepless night.

433
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,780
Do not worry about me, have a good night, Princess.

434
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,170
Sleep well.

435
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,820
Did you put the princess to sleep?

436
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,160
That girl doesn't sleep. Even miserable, she doesn't, really.

437
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,980
Do you see any girls?

438
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,390
How is she?

439
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,110
She is clearly my style, tough.

440
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,520
Tough girls aren't easy to control. Get an easy one.

441
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,410
Carefully, carefully. This way.

442
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,390
My god, how long has it been since we came to a nightclub?

443
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,440
How old are we?

444
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,370
Life is too full of ups and downs.

445
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,300
Put a red label on today.

446
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,890
I learn to play by watching youngsters.

447
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:05,770
Got it? So why don't we get some liquor today?

448
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,300
- No that's expensive.
Right?

449
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,610
Hey, do it. This hyung has lots of money, order it!

450
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,790
Let's go all out today!

451
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,440
Okay! Shall we play?

452
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,410
Do not pour drinks for anyone.

453
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,530
If you you like them, pour hard liquor. If not, pour beer only.

454
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:35,250
Ahn Jae Woo! Don't pour good stuff for a bomb. Get it?

455
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,530
Ok, why are you telling me that?

456
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,890
Okay!

457
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,710
I want hard liquour. Beer upsets my stomach.

458
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,190
What's your major again?
Civil engineering.

459
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,810
What do you do?

460
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:24,650
It's studying to become knowledgeable in the theory and practice of

461
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,110
planning, designing, constructing structures, and maintaining buildings.

462
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,470
Actually, my dad was a carpenter so,

463
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:38,880
but even my father's dream was not to be a carpenter. I wanted to do this ..

464
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,740
I have more! What is it when a pig farts?

465
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,900
Pig? Pig fart?

466
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,640
Donkasu ( "Pig gas" -- Donkatsu is a pork cutlet

467
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,850
So what is it when the pig sits down? Donbangseok! (Pig sits down is pun for money talks)

468
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,850
Oppa, you are so funny!

469
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,730
Let's stop here.

470
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,800
Let's go out.

471
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,250
It's ok. If we don't do this now, when would we?

472
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,760
- Nice to meet you.
- The same.

473
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,400
- How old are you?
-Thirty eigh...

474
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,360
Do I look like I'm in my 30's?

475
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,500
I am sure you're not underage so~ 20 years old?

476
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,380
She looks like a little kid. So cute.

477
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,980
I am 26, so I am an oppa.

478
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,150
Seems like it.

479
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,710
Who said you can shorten your speech with my friend?

480
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,980
Sorry if I offended you.

481
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,880
Not at all. It is ok. You can lower your speech.

482
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,210
Oppa.

483
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,910
It's cute.

484
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,880
Wow, you are totally my style.

485
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,390
You probably can't drink really well since you are young.

486
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:20,150
You get better at drinking as you get older.

487
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,580
Here.

488
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,820
Let's go out. It's techno.

489
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,380
Can't we just play in here.

490
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,850
- Come quickly. Let's go.
Let's go.

491
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,470
Hurry.

492
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,020
Park Hyeon Seok's number

493
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,820
See you again.

494
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,840
Sure.

495
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,780
♬  If you can't love again ♬

496
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,320
♬  Take all my pain ♬

497
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,410
♬  Because I took you for granted  ♬

498
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,600
♬  I can't love you.  ♬

499
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,290
♬  When you take on the task of  ♬

500
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,950
♬  meeting someone else who isn't me ♬

501
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:36,780
♬  I'll let you forget and leave because anyway it would have been me. ♬

502
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,810
♬ Whenever sad music plays ♬

503
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:45,170
♬ It feels like tears will come ♬

504
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:51,090
♬Now I thought I had forgotten you, ♬

505
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,970
♬but when I got drunk I cried. ♬

506
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,560
♬ If you're ready to groove let me hear you say Yeah ♬

507
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,780
Yeah! Yeah!

♬ 1, 2, 3 go ♬

509
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,650
♬ I was convinced I was a fool. ♬

510
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,280
- You!
- You!

511
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,010
Hey!

512
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,830
What is this? You came to a nightclub!

513
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,320
Act your age, you ahjumma!

514
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,180
Are you the only one living a new life? Have you found the perfect life?

515
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,910
How did you hold back for so long?

516
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:05,160
I know right? How did I live like that? I will live my life.

517
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,100
You think you can attract men like that?

518
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,860
Get your senses back together, you Ahjumma.

519
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,950
Jeez.

520
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,520
That jerk!

521
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,950
Omo!

522
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,580
You there! Get out of the way!!

523
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,860
Why are you just standing here. What are you thinking about?

524
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,820
It's nothing.

525
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,750
But, you...

526
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,870
Have you ever hugged anyone?

527
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,880
What? Hug someone?

528
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,380
I mean, a girl?

529
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,250
Never mind. It's late, let's go.

530
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,920
What the.

531
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,020
Did something happen between you and Ma Jin Joo?

532
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,640
Why is she making a fuss about coming in here?

533
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,070
I know, I think it is your fault. Seems like she hates you.

534
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,920
I also think so.

535
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,790
I can't drink with Yoon Bo Reum.

536
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:33,780
OK, don't drink.

537
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,930
Hey Yoon Bo Reum, you must not be a good drinker.

538
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,650
Women should not be good at holding their drinks.

539
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,970
If a girl drinks better than a boy, well, you know.

540
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,760
It's totally not good, right?

541
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,090
What?

542
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,470
Stop it. Stop it!

543
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:52,940
What? You agree?

544
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,660
I was having a good time, why did he have to show up?

545
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:14,550
Tada. Good job, Ma Jin Joo.

546
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,120
Let's go one time.

547
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,250
I won't do it.

548
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,180
Aish.Just once!

549
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,550
I said I don't want to.

550
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,720
Here, here. Me!

551
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,820
You are the best! I lost!

552
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,350
You can challenge me anytime.

553
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,390
but we aren't done yet.

554
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,540
What's up with you? Why are you laughing?

555
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,320
It's cute.

556
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,090
Today is really ...

557
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,120
Do you want to go up against me?

558
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:15,780
No, not at all. Don't misunderstand. You are good at drinking, much better than myself.

559
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,020
I said I would see you again, and here we are.

560
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,840
You!

561
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,140
Me?

562
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,720
Do you remember yesterday? Or do you not?

563
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,720
You better answer properly.

564
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:44,060
Yes, I think I probably remember.

565
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,490
You think? Let's say you said you do.

566
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,660
That is...

567
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,380
Then make sure you keep the promise you made me.

568
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,420
Promise?

569
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,430
Your friend is really drunk.

570
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,890
What is going on?

571
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,440
I think she is drunk.

572
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,250
Mic test.

573
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,040
Mic test.

574
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,200
She must have lost it.

575
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,250
She must have lost it. Hey! Ma Jin Joo!

576
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,760
Bo Reum, come here.

577
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,480
This woman is over doing it.

578
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,830
She can't even drink. Why would she get so drunk?

579
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,480
You scrooge!

580
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,190
There she goes.

581
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:48,220
Come over here, you scrooge! Scrooge.

582
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,740
Scrooge!

583
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,760
I said come down here. Are you the only great one! I'm good too.

584
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,860
I got a guy's number because I am pretty.

585
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:14,420
I am the best!

586
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,480
The oppa that gave me his number, right?

587
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:28,280
Director Park?

588
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,920
I will call you.

589
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,430
Ma Jin Joo seriously?

590
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,650
You don't even know what kind of bastard he is.

591
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:44,320
Hey! Tightwad. Because of you

592
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,850
my life turned into a dog's life.

593
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,450
But what about Seo Jin?

594
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,820
Seo Jin.

595
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,650
What will you do about him?

596
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,030
Huh.

597
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,620
Has she lost her mind?

598
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,140
What is this?

599
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,840
Scrooge! I am talking about you.

600
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,530
Get out of here.

601
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:28,400
Put me down.

602
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,170
you and your long hair!

603
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,870
Don't you ever come here again.

604
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,380
That ahjussi is really drunk.

605
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,960
Ahjussi, go sleep at home. You will twist your face here.

606
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,050
Get up you idiot.

607
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:50,210
I'm so embarrassed.

608
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:54,790
Who is Seo Jin? Sounded like a guy's name.

609
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,990
Where are you going?

610
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

611
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:04,630
Hold on, how do I deal with him?

612
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,640
Ban Do!

613
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,540
I'm so embarrassed.

614
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,630
What will you do about Seo Jin?

615
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,640
Seo Jin. What will you do about him?

616
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,890
Are you enjoying yourselves today, fellow students?

617
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,700
There's no doubt it's a spring day.

618
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,770
It's Yang Pa's Ahdio.

619
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,550
- I'm done, I can't hold it in anymore.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

620
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,080
Whatever, I'm going.

621
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,220
Are you ok?

622
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,030
Hey, Ma Jin Joo.

623
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,220
What are you doing?

624
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,160
Follow me.

625
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,040
What's with you...Oi!

626
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,470
Why are you acting like you know me?

627
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,110
Why am I acting like I know you?

628
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,130
You,

629
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,910
do you even know what kind of jerk that guy is?

630
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,290
What about it?

631
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,590
Give it to me?
What?

632
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,520
The number you got from that jerk last night.

633
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,370
You must really think you are 20.

634
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:56,940
Who do you think you are to tell me what to do?

635
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,060
Whether I got a guy's number or not.

636
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,440
you are amazing a woman who has a kid

637
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,380
You're doing great getting drunk and causing mess.

638
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,880
Seriously do not contact him. He is human trash.

639
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,230
Ajussi! whether I drink or dance..

640
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:24,330
or I meet with trash or not, what does it matter to you?

641
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,510
Ok, as you say we are strangers.

642
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,570
Why do we keep getting entangled?

643
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,720
Do you want to advertise that we got divorced?

644
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,930
Why don't you just say we left our kid to start over?

645
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,300
Things like this happen when people are drunk.

646
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,820
You think I can't do it? It is a fact after all.

647
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,550
There you go talking about facts.

648
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:51,400
You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.

649
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,160
How are we the same?

650
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:02,920
You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.

651
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:12,070
How are we the same. You are a married man yet you are all over your first love.

652
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,510
Does your first love know? That you're a married man and have a kid?

653
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,570
Why am I married? I got divorced.

654
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,570
No one here knows that.

655
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:29,520
Then what about you? You have a kid yet you are going for a young guy?

656
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,720
You can't get yourself together. That is more outrageous. You're an ahjumma.

657
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,380
What is going on? Did they both cheat on each other?

658
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,550
They must be crazy.

659
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,430
Yesterday? That was an accident.

660
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,140
Don't even think about not paying me the alimony. I'm going to leave you penniless.

661
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,630
I am a student. I can't even afford gum.

662
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,290
I'm a student. A broke student.

663
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:56,010
I can't give it to you. No, I won't give it. Why should I hand over that money?

664
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,020
This is unbelievable.

665
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,560
There is a married student?

666
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,210
You stingy jerk.

667
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,480
Why? I thought you liked gum. The price of gum!

668
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,310
Epilogue. 2004.

669
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:33,120
Did you know we ran out of money for this month?

670
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,760
We have to live frugally.

671
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,130
What? Already? For the month? How are we going to get through?

672
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,270
How are we going to live?

673
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,150
We can live off of my love.

674
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,070
Right!

675
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,170
What's with you. Surprising me.

676
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,610
What did you do today?

677
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:03,460
I cleaned, cooked, and worked on our finances.

678
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,160
You.
Me?

679
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,980
I achieved something great today.

680
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,580
I am the first newbie to get this many contracts signed so fast! first!

681
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,350
Isn't that great?

682
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,550
Soon you will be the god of sales.

683
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:21,370
You did a good job!

684
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:34,410
If we didn't get married, what would we be doing now?

685
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:38,680
Probably playing and wasting money like others.

686
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,860
I guess so.

687
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,390
I do wish I had money to waste.

688
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:47,780
Why? Is there something you would like to do?

689
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,930
Yes. You?

690
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,350
Me?

691
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,410
Let's both say it.

692
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,950
1, 2, 3

693
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:00,870
Nightclub.

694
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:07,330
♬ Now if the answer is love ♬

695
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:13,430
♬ Then I will love everything in this world. ♬

696
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,270
Our youth that was like a spring day where we didn't get to view the flowers,

697
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:30,220
We turned and turned around. More passionate, stronger.

698
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,650
it found us again.

699
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:39,510
Bucket list:
1.Go to a club.
♬ Going where we had ties and longed for ♬

700
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:45,710
♬ the other people we encountered ♬

701
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:49,200
Didn't JinJoo throw it away? Why did she get it back?

702
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,880
We can revive it. It didn't die yet

703
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:00,150
♬ I only know how to live. ♬

704
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:07,080
♬ There would be more mistakes and times of distress ♬

705
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:12,670
♬ We realized we could not move.  ♬

706
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,990
Go back couple
Preview

707
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,580
There is a divorcee student in our school.

708
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,430
His appearance is huge.

709
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,250
Is this called a date?

710
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,240
You should've been careful saving someone.

711
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,540
She should take care of herself.

712
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:36,510
But why did you do it suddenly? Asking for my number and coming to visit me...like another person.

713
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,440
How silly. Why would I get nervous right there?

714
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,470
I want to get to know you.
