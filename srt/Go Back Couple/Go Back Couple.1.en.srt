1
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,850
Stop trembling. Your knees will fall apart.

2
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,340
W-Who's nervous? This isn't a big deal.

3
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,130
All I have to do is walk forward.

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,400
That's right, don't be nervous. Here, get hypnotized.

5
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,370
Groom, enter.

6
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,810
He's so nervous.

7
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,680
All you had to do was go forward.

8
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,090
Bride, enter.

9
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,900
- You stepped on my dress.
- What?

10
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,720
Get off!

11
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,280
Jin Joo!

12
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,480
Jin Joo! Jin Joo, are you okay? Is your leg hurt?

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,910
You startled me!

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:45,340
♬  Into the fantasy that welcomes me ♬

15
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,590
In romance dramas, the marriage is always the ending.

16
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,720
And it's a happy ending too.

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,600
After overcoming all of the obstacles and hard times in their way,

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,030
marriage is the final destination in love.

19
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,250
♬  Every day ♬

20
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,120
Now, the bright, newlywed main characters

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,920
opened that door of blessings and lived happily ever after.

22
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,710
I approve the divorce of Choi Ban Do and Ma Jin Joo.

23
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,410
Courthouse

24
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,810
14 years later

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,610
Seoul Family Court

26
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,310
What's that?

27
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,680
You went through a lot all these years. I'll have to comfort you at least.

28
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,730
Yes.

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,490
Yes, you f*cker! You suffered a lot all this time.

30
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,280
Aigoo, crazy bastard. Just pay the child support on time.

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,780
Ah, well. That isn't much.

32
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,510
Even if I don't earn enough to buy gum, I'll give it to you on time. Even if it's dirty.

33
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,630
Till the end you're pathetic.

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,310
Oh, did you just figure that out? That's my character.

35
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,400
Hey, Jin Joo.

36
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,810
What?

37
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,270
Let me see Seo Jin often.

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,690
Yes.

39
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,610
Did the main characters in a romance drama

40
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,680
continue to have a happy ending?

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,170
Episode 1 - Marriage is not a happy ending

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,140
One month before the divorce

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,080
Mom! Mom! Mom!

44
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,120
- Seo Jin, Mom is right here. Mom is here.
- Mom! Mom...

45
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,570
Mom, Mom, Mom...

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,860
Our Seo Jin likes Mom this much?

47
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,230
You couldn't wait that long?

48
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,730
- Aigoo, how pretty.
- Agh!

49
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,620
That scared me. You should close the door before doing your business.

50
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,060
Why are you holding the kid while you're pooping?

51
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,810
There you go.

52
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,250
Hey!

53
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,780
What?

54
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,620
Never mind.

55
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,450
Aigoo, Aigoo, our Seo Jin.

56
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,760
Wedding Anniversary
- Stay here and play.

57
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,110
What am I expecting? What should I expect...

58
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,510
Let it go.

59
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,810
Hey, really. Seriously.

60
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,330
Why is he doing something like this now?

61
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,340
He has some sense. This should be expensive.

62
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,010
- Why'd he do this... Is it too much?
- Hey! Hey, hey!

63
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,710
- How can you open this?
- Why not?

64
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,440
- It's mine—
- It's Chairman Lee's wedding anniversary. Why are you taking the madam's present?

65
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,730
Why'd you open it... Give it to me.

66
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,370
- What's the password to our apartment?
- What are you talking about?

67
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,890
I said, what's the password to the apartment?

68
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,430
Why are you like this? 0-7-2-0. Why?

69
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,000
What day is that?

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,130
It's our wedding anniversary! July 20th!

71
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,000
It's today...

72
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,030
Honey. Put that down. Stay calm. Let's talk this out. Talking, huh?

73
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,060
"Talking?"

74
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,280
That's all of my records. If I don't have that, I can't work.

75
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,780
You know that. The notebook to a marketing employee is like a bullet. What happens to a soldier if he goes to war without bullets?

76
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,870
I die. Die. It's suicide.

77
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,650
Everything is in there. All of the chairmans' birthdays to their medication schedules.

78
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,660
Okay! I-I'll buy jewelry for you! Something even better!

79
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,420
Never mind that.

80
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,610
I'm really losing my patience. We're able to live and eat because of that! You don't even know.

81
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,270
Do you really think I'll eat food and live because of this notebook? Even if I go out and sell gum, I'll earn more than you.

82
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,390
You're bragging about everything when you don't even amount to gum.

83
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,090
You cheap... cheapskate!

84
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,270
What? Cheapskate?

85
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,340
- Ah, my muscle spasm...
- Aigoo...

86
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,180
Okay. Fine, cheapskate. I acknowledge. I also acknowledge that I make only a measly amount.

87
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,020
So, just put that down. Then we'll talk.

88
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,880
So pathetic. Is this some kind of treasure?

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,290
Of course! The food you eat, the clothes you're wearing,

90
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,540
and each and every one of the baby's diapers are from that.

91
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,940
If something bad happens to that notebook, we're getting.. divorced.

92
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,240
- What?
- Divorce, I said!

93
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,730
Really!

94
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,090
Korean Pharmaceuticals

95
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,860
- Yes, Chairman Kim.
- Team Leader Choi, did you forget about the medication delivery today?
- What?

96
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,750
Are you crazy?

97
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll leave right now, I'll be there in ten minutes.

98
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,240
ugh ~ really, Ma Jin Joo!

99
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

100
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,510
My notebook fell in water.

101
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,250
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

102
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,210
Oh, Seo Jin. Oh, Mom is sorry. Mom did wrong.

103
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,110
Aigoo! Oh..

104
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,160
I told him to change the lights...

105
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,180
There we go.

106
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,340
Aigo, that one is flickering too! You should change that quickly, or else your eyesight will get worse.

107
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,470
I'll do an amazing job on this too.

108
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,740
Please give that to me.

109
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,620
Give it.

110
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,030
It's hot, it's hot.

111
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,520
Should I finish the rest?

112
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,210
The deadline is tomorrow.

113
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,370
University

114
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,420
Ahjumma! Ahjumma!

115
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,530
- Me?
- I told you to move over, Ahjumma.

116
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,330
Wow, as expected, Team Leader Choi is the best at the performance.

117
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,080
The best!

118
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,150
For Chairman Mi, I'll add Coca-Cola to make it sweet.

119
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,130
You got sense.

120
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,960
Don't do it next time.

121
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,790
You're right. You usually never make mistakes, what happened today?

122
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,610
I'm sorry.

123
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,230
Come to your senses. Come to your senses.

124
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,180
Drink and eat as much as you'd please. I'll treat you to a full course today. With that,

125
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,280
would you like ten more plates of snacks to go with the drink?
- No, no.

126
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,750
We're fine with this. It's just a relief that you didn't make a mistake with Chairman Park.

127
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,210
Chairman Park, that bastard. Does he still ask you to take care of his mistresses?

128
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,290
Yes, well.

129
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,610
Do they think marketing employees are their own underlings?

130
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,680
He's all over the place believing in his wife's family.

131
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,230
He flirts with young nurses at a hospital his father-in-law built for him.

132
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,140
He's a bad person, that punk. Aish, really.

133
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,240
Should we have a drink?

134
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,090
Seo Jin, what's the matter? What do I do? Why do you keep throwing up?

135
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,240
Ah, what are you doing? Why aren't you picking up the phone?

136
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,140
This kid...

137
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,130
I have to answer this call.

138
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:34,060
Yes, Chairman Park.
- Hey, hurry up and go to Nurse Kim. I got caught red-handed by my wife. Aish.

139
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,440
Ah, but... now?

140
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,070
Yeah, now!

141
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,450
I understand.

142
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,200
- Hurry up, quickly.
- Why are you like this?

143
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,910
- Come quickly.
- You might cross paths with my wife. She'll beat you up.

144
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,630
- Hey, don't let her put a finger on her until I leave.

145
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,490
Come quickly, quickly.

146
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,610
Oh, what's the matter? I'm supposed to see the Chairman here.

147
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,810
Aish, why is today like this, really?

148
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,330
- You'll see blood before you see the Chairman! We need to go quickly!
- Hey!!

149
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,690
We're screwed.

150
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,760
You got caught red-handed, you wench.

151
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,510
Madam, wait. Wait a second.

152
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,080
Do you have no one else to seduce that you would seduce a married man?

153
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,210
Oh, Madam, it's not like that!

154
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,070
What do you see me as? Do you think it's my first time dealing with someone like you?

155
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,420
W-Wait a minute, Madam. Stay calm.

156
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,140
Let's talk. Let's talk it out.

157
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,240
You again? Are you Park Hyeon Seok's windbreaker?

158
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,170
Why do you keep jumping in?

159
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,300
Aren't you moving?

160
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,780
Madam that really hurts.

161
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,090
That really hurts. I am telling you it really hurts.

162
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,010
You!

163
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,320
Madam, that wasn't on purpose. I ...

164
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,190
Are you crazy? How dare you lay hands on her?

165
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,600
Honey!

166
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,580
He'll be fine now.

167
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,350
It's acute enteritis. Be careful with food.

168
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,410
Thank you

169
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,510
Seo jin. Mom is sorry.

170
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,120
Credit card bill.

171
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,790
I told you to protect my girlfriend. Who told you to hit my wife?

172
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,620
How dare you hit her!

173
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,240
I think this affair got buried with my one punch.

174
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,280
You know I didn't hit you for real, right?

175
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,980
I hit you on purpose. As a show.

176
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,750
I heard your performance is good at work.

177
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,150
Of course, I buy so much from you.

178
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,640
Let's let this one pass quietly. Bring me new medications if you have any.

179
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,930
You have to maintain your sales performance. Huh?

180
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,860
That a**hole..

181
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,180
Are you feeling better?

182
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,570
Why? Did something happen?

183
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,290
No, your face.

184
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,420
I fell over drinking. I should quit drinking or something..

185
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,200
I really like you. As expected of my hoobae...

186
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,210
Why didn't I know someone like you in college?

187
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,570
Civil engineering department, right?

188
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,410
Yes, that's right!

189
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,550
It would've been so nice if I knew then.

190
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,500
I was a total shy fool then.

191
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,640
I know. I'm sure we crossed our paths at least once. Don't you think?

192
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,880
If I had known you then, I would've killed you.

193
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,960
Here. Thanks for letting me use it under your name.

194
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,950
Why? Why don't you use it more? You can use it.

195
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,310
It's not my money. I only let you borrow my name.

196
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,900
Even if the bill doesn't come to our house, she knows like a psychic.

197
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,140
Wow... she looks dense, so it was easy to seduce her to marry.

198
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,760
But this woman catches on faster as she gets older.

199
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,720
what is this?

200
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,460
Motel? Hotel?

Min Jeong 9 post natal centre)

Unni , isn't this your husband?

203
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,240
I saw him a while ago while passing. Just in case.

204
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,760
I can't come home today.

205
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,300
How can i go back home like this?

206
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,160
Yeah?

207
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,610
How can you do this to me? How could you?

208
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,250
I am not in the mood to fight, I don't have the energy for it.

209
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,870
After meeting you, do you know because of you, how miserable

210
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,600
my life became?

211
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:41,640
Then I... Do you know how I'm treated outside at work?

212
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,950
I'm treated worse than a dog... Do you know how I live...

213
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,930
Do you even know?

214
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,120
My life became a mess after I met you, too!

215
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,450
is that my fault?

216
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,690
Then whose fault is it? Is it because of me?

217
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,080
Let's get a divorce.

218
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,400
What?

219
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,360
We're too miserable. I am so miserable.

220
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,280
We shouldn't have met.

221
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:33,980
I want to turn back time, I want to turn back everything from the star.

222
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,480
Let's get a divorce.

223
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,570
Let's stop.

224
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,620
Fine.

225
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,850
Let's get a divorce. Let's stop.

226
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,030
Let's get a divorce!

Go Eun Sook

233
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,570
Mom, have you been well? I am sorry I don't visit often.

234
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:56,630
I am a bad daughter, who doesn't visit her mom because she is raising her own kid.

235
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:03,310
but when you meet Seo Jin, you'll change your mind, he's so beautiful.

236
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,610
even more than your daughter.

Why am I doing this? So silly...

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,650

Uri Mart

241
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,760
- How much is it?
- 3000 won.

242
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,120
It's been a while. Yes.

243
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,720
Why did you come home? Did your wife run away?

244
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,530
Forever?

245
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,620
You still like to joke around even when you're older.

246
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,910
- Have a nice sale.
- Okay.

247
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,320
Are you okay?

248
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,400
Did you do it?

249
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,850
Did the judge really slam his gavel saying, "You're now divorced"?

250
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,200
- Hello.
- Why don't you reply? Did the judge really slam it down?

251
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,130
I told you not to call him , right?
Ah, wait wait.

252
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,950
How about alimony? How much did it come to?

253
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,650
Give me that.

254
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,240
Yeah, it's Jae Woo. This guy, he's really drunk.

255
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,440
Anyway, get some rest and call me when you feel better. Okay.

256
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,300
Why? I'm curious.

257
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,070
That's another man business. Why are you curious?

258
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,010
I have to. So I get one too.

259
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,670
You bastard.

260
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm bad? You're not even married. Do you know the difficulties of 12 million married men in Korea?

261
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,470
I don't know. How would I know?

262
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,340
I envy you. Stay like this forever. Stay like this till you die, you bastard.

263
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,740
Does it suit me?

264
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,440
What is this?

265
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,700
You a**hole... did you put briquet on your head?

266
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,690
It's black powder, you a**hole! My hair is going gray and falling out on top of it.

267
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,410
Ah, my precious hair.

268
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,230
You're into all kinds of things, man.

269
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,950
In any case, why did they get a divorce all of a sudden?

270
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,330
It's like that. Kids who were desperately in love...

271
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,710
It doesn't last forever.

272
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,270
Look at you. You... You're the perfect example.

273
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,360
I told you not to speak of Yoon Bo Reum, right?

274
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,100
I didn't talk about Yoon Bo Reum. I was talking about couples who were desperately in love back in college.

275
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,440
You and your first love.

276
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,920
- It's a perfect weather to die.
- Perfect for what?

277
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,660
I told you not to speak of Yoon Bo Reum, didn't I?

278
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,600
Hey hey you!

279
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,300
- Hey...
- Punk, you think I'm...

280
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,480
Hey, hey! Do whatever you want!

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,430
Straight, straight, do it energetically!

284
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,590
Straight, straight, we'll keep going!

285
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:32,030
Straight, straight, great!

286
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,430
Hi Jin Joo. Can you talk?

287
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,900
What about Seo Jin? Will you raise him?

288
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,830
That turned out good.

289
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,940
No. It was just yesterday you were so happy for being pregnant with Seo Jin.

290
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,540
What happened all of a sudden? Why did you do it?

291
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,710
No way. Did he cheat on you?

292
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,530
It's not like that.

293
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,690
Bo Reum, later when the time comes I'll tell you.

294
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,420
Ok.

295
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,430
It's been 8 years since Michael Jackson, who did his last concert in Korea 18 years ago...

296
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,770
passed away.

297
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,090
Uncle, you're here?

298
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,410
Where are you going now?

299
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,990
You troublemaker! You're always causing trouble!

300
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,570
Whatever

301
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,420
That little!

302
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,330
That idiot! I should send him off to military or something.

303
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,940
Noona. What's with calling your kid "idiot"?

304
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,810
You idiot!

305
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,030
Really..

306
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,900
Why did you cheat on her, you bastard?

307
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,550
What are you looking at, you punk?

308
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,160
What's going on?

309
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,780
Ahjussi...

310
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,030
Ah... Ahjussi!

311
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,040
The son who was sacrificed unfairly...

312
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,700
- Mom!
- Scared me!

313
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,240
Are you okay? The earthquake just now...

314
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,530
What earthquake?

315
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:43,930
My head is having an earthquake because of you. Go back to sleep!

316
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,830
The bus was shaking a lot. It was an earthquake.

317
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,710
Oh, my... look at this ahjumma... I didn't drive that fast and you say it shook that much?

My tummy...

319
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,190
Mom, do you have any bean sprout soup or something?

320
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,140
Give me a break, what bean sprout soup?

321
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,590
I'm upset, too.

There are still fumigation trucks these days.

325
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,380
My stomach...

326
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,270
When your stomach hurts, taste that's hot and spicy...

327
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,680
What's wrong with the expiration date?

328
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,440
[ Expiration Date: 12-1-1999 ]
Eh? This one too?

329
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,620
Ahjumma. There's something wrong with the expiration date. I know retro items are in these days...

330
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,080
Do the expiration date go after the retro phase, too?

331
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,250
What are you talking about? What's so strange? It's still far off.

332
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,700
- Huh? Ahjumma, what's wrong with your face?
- What's wrong with my face?

333
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,000
You look so young.

334
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,570
Oh, my! You're joking. How old do I look?

335
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,150
40?

336
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:09,180
Are you kidding me? I'm 30! Keep calling me ahjumma, ahjumma...

337
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,040
You got botox, huh? You did.

338
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,280
- Did you get hit by someone?
- No.

339
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,670
Botox? Who's that?

340
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,040
Ahjumma! Move, move!

341
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,670
What's this? Why is my face like this?

342
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,270
Mom! Dad!

343
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,260
What?

344
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,530

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:07,460
Jin Joo, Jin Joo, what's wrong? Jin Joo?

350
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,640
What's wrong?

351
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,810
Mom?

352
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,210
You never appeared in my dream.

353
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,040
I have a jackpot of a dream today.

354

Mom, Mom, Mom!

355
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,450
- What's wrong...
- Mom, I'm sorry...

356
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,700
I couldn't tell you yesterday... I got a divorce, Mom.

357
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,050
I wanted to live well and it turned out this way...

358
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:54,410
Mom, should I just die...

359
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,330
Mom, take me... take me with you...

360
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,740
Mom, I want to go where you are... Mom...

361
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,160
What in the world... Are you crazy?

362
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,480
Am I the Grim Reaper? To die after me?

363

If you want to die, you die. I'm going to live forever.

How dare you say this stuff early in the morning?

365
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,750
It hurts. Why does it hurt?

366
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,740
Oh, my! It hurts! Why does it hurt?

367
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,910
It hurts because I hit you.

368
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:38,320
I hit you! Get up and go to school!

369
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,850
It hurts.

Does this make sense? How could this happen?

374
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,370
Go to school!

375
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,380
- So yummy.
- He's so precious.

376

Mom, Mom...

377
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:04,040
Is it the Gifted School? Maybe I should send him there. They say no one's ever spoken this early in age.

378
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,930
He crawled fast and flipped over fast.

379

Mom, I'm really going to school, right?

380
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,720
What, you don't want to go?

381
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,310
Mom, I'm really 20 years old, right?

382
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,860
- Could you be 40 then?
- Mom, I'm really a freshman in civil engineering, right?

383
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,650
Yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, take a beating, man!

384

What kind of crazy guy is this from early in the morning?

Dad, it hurts so bad.

- Huh?
- I'm so happy. It means it's not a dream.

Dad, hit me once more.

Noona, he's a total idiot. Apply to military now.

393

You idiot. How dare you call him an idiot?

394
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,880
You said so. That he's an idiot.

395

Are you crazy? Hey!

396

That idiot...

397

Why is this man doing this early in the morning... Oh, my! Scared me!

- Mom.
- Look, look, why are you doing this? So gross!

399

Did you change your strategy?

You can't even imagine what's happening to me right now.

405

Is the heaven rewarding me?

Get away!

I don't want to? What school? Why go to school?

412
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,630
Why would I go?

413
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,490
Unni!

Hey, Ma Jin Joo, come here. It won't work.

415
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,860
Why did you take the suitcase out?

416
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,010
I told you. I said I'm leaving home if you don't buy me cell phone.

417
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,180
We'll do it. Me and Jin Joo.

418
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,020
How old are you? What? Leave home if she doesn't buy you a cell phone?

419
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,040
You tiny little thing. How dare you threaten Mom?

420
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,330
Are you crazy? I'm your older sister!

421
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:35,870
That's right! You are my older sister, but I'm older now.

422
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,740
How dare you threaten Mom after all she did to raise you?

423
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,930
How much would you regret when Mom dies?

424
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,870
- When Mom dies?
- Hey!

425
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:54,330
Look at this girl... from earlier... Are you praying that your mom dies?

426
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,010
- Honey!
- Yeah?

427
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,210
Yeah?

428
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,710
Take them. Geez, so crazy. Come out.

- Hurry up and go!
- I don't want to.

430

Why would I go to school? I want to be with Mom.

431
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,620
If you say you're leaving home once more or whatever, you're dead.

432
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,150
What? Did I say that? You said that yesterday.

433
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,920
I did?

434
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,170
She won't buy us because it's all in our words. We should show her in action.

435
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,120
Unni, hurry up and pack up.

436
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,000
Everyone has a cell phone. We're the only ones who don't.

437
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,310
I'm going to leave home. Let the two of them live happily ever after.

438
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,220
By chance, you...

439
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,070
She bought you, right? You bought one for only her, right?

440
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:03,120
Buy me one! Mom, Mom, buy me one, too!

441
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,640
Go to school, go to school!

442
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,140
- Go to school.
- Dad...

443
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,970
Ouch! Why me, why me? I'll stay with you, Mom.

444
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,110
Why me?

445
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,750
No, no, no!

446
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,200
Mom, my school...

447
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,210
No, not me!

448
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,990
Hurry up and take her!

449
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,370
Ouch!

450
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,530
Mom! Not me!

451
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,920
The two girls... there's not a peaceful day.

452
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,050
Don't talk to your mom about buying you a phone. End of discussion.

453
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,930
Why are you staring at me like that?

454
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:54,590
It's real. It's really my school.

455
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,250
Is this a dream or reality? No way it's a dream when it's so vividly real like that. ...

456
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,660

Should I tell your mom about buying you a phone?

460
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,610
I am going!

461
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,680
Why is she upset? to the extent she is using formalities!

462
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,860
How pretty!!

463
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,850
I am so pretty!

464
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,090
Look at my skin!

465
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:10,570
Aigoo. There is no cure for that..

466
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,050
I drank so much of that drink.

467
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,080
Wow!

If there's God, I'll sell my soul not to have to meet you.

487

We weren't supposed to meet. All of it. Everything.

He was pitiful since he was young. Like him? What did I like about him?

Wow, what happened to OCD Ma Jin Joo who refused to share food because it's a slobber fest?

508
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,640
You try raising a kid. That won't work.

509

I guess... My Seo Jin is so precious.

510
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:17,380
Who cares about OCD? You won't have to eat food to stay full.

I think he asked me out once..

517
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,740
Ya. I remember, and you strangely turned him down.

518
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,080
What did I do strange?

Ma Jin Joo... what made you dump such a golden toad like that?

526
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:16,760
I wasn't in my rightful mind.

527
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,050

What? What is that? Did he just avoid eye contact?

I should've gone after her, but I was such a shy fool then.

631

Not shy. You were just plain ignorant.

00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,900
Even if you go back in time, you won't be able to seduce Min Seo Yeong.

633
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,520
If I go back, I should seduce her. Why would I date someone like Ma Jin Joo?

634
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:03,070
Look at this! Isn't he so cute? He's no joke.

635
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:08,680
He says "Daddy" these days. He's speaking words really early on.

636
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,560
In the old days your personality was just as crazy. You're dead.

637
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,720
Could he be a genius? Hey, that gifted school. Is it expensive?

638
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,340
Run Suzy!

639
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:29,040
Seo Jin! Kiss! Kiss!

640
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:36,920
♫ We realized that we couldn't avoid it ♫

641
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:43,280
♫ If the answer to that is love ♫

642
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,190
♫ I will love everything in this world ♫

644
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,680
Did you decide to end your life about now?

645
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,550
No. You're a spectacular hyung now.

646
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,830
I am not the 20 year old me. I just came back here.

647
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,580
I told you you're dead if I meet you in college.

648
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,660
You're dead.

649
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,970
You're Min Seo Yeong, right?

650
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,960
How did he live with me while he was missing her?

651
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,270
If I go back in time, I'll seduce her. Would I meet someone like Ma Jin Joo?

652
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:19,740
Meeting? The meeting I am thinking of?

653
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,080
Why is she here?

654
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,810
No way. Is this the first time we met?
