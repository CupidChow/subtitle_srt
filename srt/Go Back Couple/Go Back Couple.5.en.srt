2017

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,330
♫  What made me smile... ♫ (Kim Yeon Woo -  Still Beautiful)

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,660
♫  your words and smile are still... ♫
Min Seo Young

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,070
the same?

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,920
Min Seo Yeong, Premier Dancer injured
♫  I have changed. ♫

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,950
So she got injured...

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,360
She should be careful.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,400
- What are you doing when I told you to watch Seo Jin?
- Oh-

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,750
What are you doing? Are you, by any chance...

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,570
What? Why are you like this?

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,710
Are you a youth who's burning with passion?

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,810
You will be 40 the day after tomorrow! 40!

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,500
Porn?

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,620
Hey! It's not porn! What do you see me as?

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,870
I see you as a man.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,410
Why? Last time I saw the folder...

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,530
Why are you bringing up the past?

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,970
Fine, here. Look at it.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,350
Ballerina Min Seo Young?

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,560
Why are you looking at this?

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,650
There's privacy that has to be protected between married couples, too.

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,330
I was curious, so I looked it up.

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,150
Why are you so curious about her?

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,470
Well, I have the right to be curious about how she's doing.

25
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,430
For a man, he remembers his first love forever.

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,030
Am I cheating on you with her? I'm just...

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,930
Here. In my heart. I'm keeping my emotions in here.

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,220
First loves are just like that.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,620
Ugh. That so called first love.

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,050
Why don't you have a first love?

31
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,800
Your first love is... here!

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,340
You didn't like anyone before me.

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,100
For you, your first boyfriend, your first marriage.

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,100
You got it all. This is why you don't understand me.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,010
How is it? Living with your first love?

36
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,800
Is it nice? Tell me. It's nice, right?

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,920
Tell me. I'm curious.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
How is it? Nice, right?

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,940
No.

40
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,670
Why are you my first love? I don't have one.

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,120
That woman.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,960
Hey, hey! How can there be someone with no first love? Your first love is me.

43
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,990
Why are you deciding who my first love is? That's what I decide.

44
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,850
What's the standard for first love?

45
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,300
Is your first love the person you first date? Kiss?

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,170
Then, your first love isn't Seo Young. It's me.

47
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,830
No, that's not it. Someone who makes your heart flutter just by looking at him/her.

48
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,940
It's when you get excited just thinking of them.

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,210
That's unrequited love, not first love.

50
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,110
My heart never fluttered nor was I ever excited by looking at you.

51
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,010
In my standards, you aren't my first love.

52
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,080
First love, unlike all other types of love, is

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,690
dramatic, innocent, and pure.

54
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,270
But could there be such a thing

55
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,120
that doesn't have any standard or definition?

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,440
Episode 5: Standards for First Love

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,900
Let's go eat snacks.

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,500
1999, Seoul.

59
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,760
Excuse me...

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,470
Thank you. Aigoo, your mom must be full from having a son like you.

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,040
I only have two daughters.

62
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,270
Oh, my!

63
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,210
Mom, go in.

64
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,340
What's wrong with you? This student-

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,590
Mom, just go in first.

66
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,010
Go in.

67
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,830
Just go.

68
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,540
I was just passing by.

69
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,170
Why would you come here?

70
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,640
Did you come here to see my mom, by any chance?

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,270
Don't linger around my house ever again.

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,720
Is he someone you know?

73
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,080
- No.
- Then what's wrong with you?

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,990
That young man helped me.

75
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,270
The next time he tries to help you, just kick him.

76
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,050
- That bad guy.
- Look at you!

77
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,210
In my opinion, he seems very kind and dependable.

78
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,240
You can't even thank him. Why are you calling him a bad guy?

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,650
It's just like that. For you and me.

80
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,580
Here are the pictures.

81
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,710
Let's finish here. You guys worked hard today.

82
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,670
Ah, it's finally finished.

83
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,890
- Where are you going?
- What?

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,460
No. Get this knee

85
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,910
and this arm like this. Diagonally!

86
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,860
- Like this!
- Oh, diagonally...

87
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,330
Okay, again. Start!

88
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:56,220
If I want to wear a uniform like you, how much do I have to work?

89
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,370
What?

90
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,480
You know... your partner... that person

91
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,310
How long will it take for me to do that?

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,910
Like this... And this ... How long?

93
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,610
- Stay right there.
- Huh?

94
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,180
Raise it up!

95
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,330
He liked her so much he couldn't talk to her.

96
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,980
He couldn't even talk to her because she was so pretty.

97
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,410
Of course. Usually the first love can never be forgotten.

98
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,300
You can call Park Sin Young out now.

99
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,830
Sin Young!

100
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh. Dad, you had a first love as well?

101
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,800
She came out!

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,890
Your dad, of course, has one. The orchard family's second daughter.

103
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,520
He's still gets excited about her.

104
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,510
Well, I had no time because I had to look after my younger siblings.

105
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,480
You should've still found a first love. It's unfair.

106
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,150
You must have a lot to feel unfair about. Will your first love feed you?

107
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,010
You last love is all that matters.

108
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,280
How can you take responsibility for that Mom?

109
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,670
Why? Are you scared your Dad will cheat on me?

110
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,910
Okay, everyone come. Let's eat dinner.

111
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,980
Hurry up!

112
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,790
Yes, I'm coming.

113
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:17,800
2010

114
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,890
Marriage?

115
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,060
It's too lonely living by myself. Those around me are also feeling the same way.

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,140
Stop joking around.

117
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,250
Don't you think I can move on from Mom now?

118
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,440
Move on from Mom?

119
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,510
Has it been 10 or 20 years since Mom died?

120
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,820
It hasn't even been one year since her death.

121
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,320
And you want to move on that quickly?

122
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,710
Can you leave her?

123
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,170
You should listen to what father-in-law has to say.

124
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,490
Dad, to you is spending over 40 years with Mom just worth 1 year to you?

125
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,300
To me still

126
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,430
I still feel like Mom will be home smiling if I come.

127
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,200
I think when I call home, she'll answer.

128
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,740
So I can't even come home or call home.

129
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,040
Because it'll really feel like she's gone.

130
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,790
But Dad, you can leave her?

131
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,870
This easily?

132
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,110
Then I feel so bad for Mom.

133
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm leaving.

134
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,970
Jin Joo!

135
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,970
Excuse me...

136
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,570
What's wrong with you? It's for Dad.

137
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,040
It's yours, Mom. Eat all of it.

138
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,570
Did I make a mistake while I was drunk recently?

139
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,450
No, you were drunk the same as always.

140
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,640
My daughters! I'm home!

141
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,990
Oh, my goodness!

142
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,920
You dont' like Daddy?

143
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,780
You gave them a peck and talked with the plants.

144
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,130
I Pan Seok,

145
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,420
You're still alive.

146
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,650
You know, right?

147
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,720
That's what it was.

148
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,840
She hates when I give her a peck.

149
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,550
No, that's not it. Would she really be that upset for a long time?

150
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,070
You don't even read her diary these days.

151
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,220
Then, that's it.

152
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,320
You read it again?

153
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,080
I did it without her noticing. How did she find out?

154
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,110
She's already grown up. Why do you do it?

155
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,410
You're so strange!

156
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm worried. What if she runs into all these weird guys now that she's an adult?

157
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,700
She's a grown adult. She should be able to meet weird guys and nice guys.

158
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,650
No. She's my daughter. How could she just meet any guy?

159
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,500
Do you know how scary this world is today?

160
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,920
And also, guys are all really rotten anyway.

161
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,310
Yeah. They are.

162
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,080
Whoever it may be I'll make sure they'll be at least 10 auditions. I will.

163
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,160
I guess my daughters can't get married then.

164
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,000
Then, I'm going to spend forever with them by my side.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,890
My children.

166
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,290
My children.

167
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:33,460
♫  We can neither turn around nor go back♫

168
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,660
♫  We two who have only the same dream. ♫

169
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,880
♫ The farther we are apart, the closer we become ♫

170
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,160
♫  Is that my feeling for you? ♫

171
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:03,330
♫  Like the last dream I dremt ♫

172
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:11,020
♫  If I could turn back time... ♫

173
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,750
You should've come out of your room if you're awake. Why are you sitting?

174
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,020
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

175
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,590
Nothing? You cried.

176
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,250
I had a strange dream.

177
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,900
Really?

178
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,870
You've been acting strange lately.

179
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,040
Not only do you dream that I died.

180
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,830
Should I prescribe you some tonic?

181
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,760
What's wrong?

182
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,370
Mom.

183
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,850
My mom. My mom is so great.

184
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,870
You're really strange.

185
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,380
A grown lady like yourself is always clinging to me.

186
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,140
You're going to school already?

187
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,350
No. Take me with you guys.

188
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,290
She's gotten her dialysis done consistently for the past five years.

189
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,030
There aren't any other problems.

190
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,590
No, but. I know she's okay now, but...

191
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,490
If she keeps getting dialysis, around ten years later

192
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,810
won't she get a lot of complications?

193
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,730
The complications can come tomorrow or ten years from now.

194
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,530
There's no way that we can put off her dialysis because of that fear.

195
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,030
Still, is there anything to reduce her complications?

196
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,970
She's already doing all she can to reduce complications.

197
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,650
Your mom can live long.

198
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,270
Don't worry about it too much.

199
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,540
By whose standards will she live long?

200
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,090
It's only ten years.

201
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,580
Her children studied a lot because of their mom.

202
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,870
She even knows about complications.

203
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,040
Her son came yesterday.

204
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,740
Patient Go Eun Sook doesn't have a son.

205
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,590
- She only has two daughters.
- What?

206
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,970
Choi Ban Do, get up!

207
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,110
Get up already!

208
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,100
What, you were awake?

209
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,000
Good morning, Mom. Did you sleep well?

210
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,160
Dad. I'm not taking it.

211
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,020
Not everyone can become rich.

212
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,230
If you continue to have such a miserly heart

213
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,380
You kid, where did you memorize such sly words, you really!

214
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,920
You used to be so hard to wake up.

215
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,110
What's up with you these days?

216
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,020
- Is that cabbage extract?
- Take some even if you hate it. Do you know how good it is for you?

217
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,400
Tastes like a rag.

218
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,100
Even if it tastes like this, it's great for digestion.

219
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,860
Thanks for the drink. I'll be going.

220
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,000
He used to not take it even if I beat him to a pulp.

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,770
What's up with him today?

222
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,310
Building 31, please.

223
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,630
We're here.

224
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,310
Match your footsteps!

225
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,440
Left, left, left

226
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,290
-You must be doing morning exercise?
-Yes.

227
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,100
There's nothing difficult going on at school?

228
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,150
If you ever need anything, just tell me. I'll give you anything.

229
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,430
Put in a good word for me to your father.

230
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,290
Then, I don't even want to come out to school so

231
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,310
can you just say I went to school and give me a graduation certificate?

232
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,070
If it's to this degree, I would like some scholarship money as well.

233
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,030
I have a meeting.

234
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,210
Student Jong Ryul!

235
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,780
Isn't that the school president?

236
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,140
See? Something is up.

237
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,370
If it's not a chaebol, it's a politician.

238
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,070
Who's whispering during PT?

239
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,490
Ah! That scared me.

240
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,160
What the...

241
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,550
Go away.

242
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,110
Wait.

243
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,800
The food will taste bad if you eat alone.

244
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,580
I'm not alone.

245
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,890
How can the lunch come out dead last?

246
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,260
Not you, me.

247
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,560
What's up with him? He told me not to flirt.

248
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,060
I can't tell how to act at all.

249
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,820
What's this?

250
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,550
Senior. You must be having a hard time because of Jin Joo.

251
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,430
It's her first time receiving a confession.

252
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,660
She's so country bumpkin-like.

253
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,610
- No, it's not that.
- What?

254
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,690
It wasn't a confession.

255
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,060
It wasn't a confession.

256
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,830
I'm in the midst of seducing her.

257
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,670
You're all done right?

258
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,530
What are you doing? Follow me.

259
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,020
You should go quickly.

260
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,480
Just go quickly.

261
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,900
That senior likes Jin Joo, right?

262
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,740
You think so too right? He said he's trying to seduce her.

263
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,670
Then, he'll like her no matter her situation right?

264
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,330
Even if she's a divorcee or has a child.

265
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,680
What's so extreme? Eat up.

266
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,620
Even if it's a time of great trial and difficulty (youth), I can't tell what he's thinking!

267
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:15,660
You told me not to flirt, and it wasn't a confession. But, you're seducing me?

268
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,390
Me?

269
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,910
Not me, but you. You're in the process of seducing me.

270
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,070
What? Me? Since when did I seduce you?

271
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,960
You tried. In the last few days. And with much eagerness.

272
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,820
Wow.

273
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,260
Even if someone has tried to seduce me, I have never tried to seduce anyone.

274
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,160
At the main gate, that was an accident. The administrative offices

275
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,420
That was an accident.

276
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,180
Oh, right. Is your leg okay?

277
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,600
By any chance, does it hurt?

278
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,700
You'll have to continue to ice it for it to heal properly.

279
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,440
A place that's once fractured, if you don't take care of it, it'll last a lifetime.

280
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,290
See? You're seducing me.

281
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,010
Why do you keep saying that?

282
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,920
This is what you call seduction.

283
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,730
- What?
- If you're seducing me, help me with my bag.

284
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,060
Since it's your fault as well.

285
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,180
You don't look like you're hurting to the extent where you need someone taking care of you...

286
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,730
It's that I don't make a fuss. Every time I walk it's a tearing pain.

287
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh, really?

288
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,760
Hey, hey!

289
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,110
What kind of girl touches someone so rashly?

290
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,800
Why is he like that?

291
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,910
♬ Youngpoong, 1999. In frustration and fear, that everything might end♬

292
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,950
♬ Many people are just spending every day alone but not everyone is the same ♬

293
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,700
What are you listening to?

294
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,120
Ah! You scared me.

295
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,860
What?

296
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,880
Why?

297
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,190
It's cool.

298
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,990
What the.

299
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,930
No, no. For real. It's true.

300
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,210
A ballerina listening to hip hop. That's very cool.

301
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,870
I thought you would listen to classical music since you do ballet.

302
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,570
I see you like this type of music.

303
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,810
It's fun, right?

304
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,120
Yo. Yo.

305
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,720
There's a bounce to the beat in hip-hop. It's different from the sleep-inducing classical music.

306
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,830
Won't it be really fun to dance to hip hop?

307
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,530
Then do it.

308
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,340
I can't dance that kind of dance.

309
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,200
Ballet. Ballet is a type of dance.

310
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,190
Can you not do ballet to hip hop?

311
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,200
Of course you can't. How can you do ballet to hip hop?

312
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,940
Really? In any case, I don't really know you well.

313
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,950
We haven't known each other for a long time.

314
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,230
Exactly. That's why I need to learn.

315
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,750
Learn what?

316
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:02,400
Things I didn't know about you before. And things I didn't know about me in the past, too.

317
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,280
I definitely don't remember being rejected...

318
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,190
But why is it that I gave up without even confessing?

319
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,390
Fold what? Cranes? Turtles?

320
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,910
What cranes? Nowadays it's roses that are in.

321
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,130
Hey. What's that rag on your head?

322
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,480
What rag! You don't know HOT's doorag? You country bumpkin!

323
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,260
What a liar. You put it on so that no one recognizes you for getting your head stuck in the main gate.

324
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,890
Whose fault is that?

325
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,730
It's too bitter, I can't drink it.

326
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,200
Ok. Herbal drink!

327
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,180
Hey. He kissed Yoon Bo Reum and hasn't cleaned his teeth ever since.

328
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,820
Ew. You're disgusting.

329
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,840
Hey! You're dating Yoon Bo Reum?

330
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
Why are you so surprised?

331
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,310
Because of Yoon Bo Reum, my life...

332
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,110
I'm going to curse her.

333
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,280
I wish she went to Hell.

334
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,500
I so pitiful.

335
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,140
I pity myself. If I had never dated her.

336
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,500
Why is it that this kid continues to live his sad life?

337
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,170
Dating? That's BS.

338
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,470
Yoon Bo Reum probably gave you a peck, not a kiss.

339
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,180
That's the same thing.

340
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,930
How are they the same? It's a peck, not a kiss.

341
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,560
You give someone a peck when you meet them and say goodbye.

342
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,230
I do it with my cousin all the time. Am I dating her?

343
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,610
You peck someone because you're dating them. Why would you peck someone you're not dating?

344
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:01,660
There's kids like that too. Abroad that's a greeting you know.

345
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,850
I didn't think Yoon Bo Reum was like that, but wow sh'es really free with her touch.

346
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,220
So liberal in all directions. Great Yoon Bo Reum!

347
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,210
Again.

348
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,940
There's no way she would kiss me if we weren't dating.

349
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,980
But I'm still a man.

350
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,150
- Hi!
- Heol!

351
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,650
I thought you would leave, but you came.

352
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,350
What the? Is this all?

353
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,130
Hold me right there.

354
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,420
1.2.3.4.

355
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,650
Carry me like this please.

356
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,820
Yeah.

357
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,420
There's kids like that too sometimes.

358
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,100
Yoon Bo Reum is no ordinary girl.

359
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,610
Skinship is natural for her.

360
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,430
Okay.

361
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:21,050
Give me your bag. You follow me around just to carry that.

362
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,520
Just that? It's so expensive!

363
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,580
I spent all night making these.

364
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,700
It's delicious. You should have some.

365
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,020
What a good time to be alive.

366
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,130
If you spent all night, you should eat it.

367
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,900
I picked this up from the garbage. It tastes gross. You should have it.

368
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,920
Then, will you eat it? I mean, she spent all night excitedly making that. And you still won't take it?

369
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,520
What happens after I take it? There isn't anything free in this world.

370
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,960
It's give and take. If I take something, I need to give something.

371
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,660
Why should I make a tiresome deal with someone I don't even care about?

372
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,190
Would she have given you that expecting something back?

373
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,640
She just liked you and wanted to do something for you, like feeding you.

374
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,160
Like a parent's love. It's like that.

375
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,270
How pretty.

376
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:32,220
Do you think parents don't expect anything from you?

377
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,890
What's up with this kid? He's so strange.

378
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,830
- Give me it.
- What?

379
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,320
You told me to eat it. Isn't it because you want to do anything for me and feed me?

380
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,690
No, that's not me.

381
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,330
Let's meet each other at 7 pm over there. I can't drive you know.

382
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,760
You should take this.

383
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,870
Just give it to me later. I'm going.

384
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,360
Your leg looks fine!

385
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,600
What is this? Is he really hurt or no?

386
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,900
With this, you won't get kicked out?

387
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,660
They're saying I should work off my penalty points by volunteering.

388
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,290
Ahn Jae Woo, that traitor.

389
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,370
You're here?

390
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,460
Here it is.

391
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,310
Number 85.

392
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,240
Why's that young thing so manly?

393
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,330
He's older than you. He's famous. The most handsome in Hankuk University.

394
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,570
His height, his face, his fit in clothes.

395
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,990
There's a rumor he's the grandson of a large corporation owner.

396
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,770
Really?

397
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,660
He might be the son of the Minister of Defense.

398
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,180
- Oh.
- But the way I see it, there's something to it.

399
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,250
He's an ideal son huh?

400
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,430
What? He hit what?

401
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,080
The son of a mother's friend.(  an ideal son )

402
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,900
He's your mom's friend's son?

403
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,210
It's nothing.

404
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,050
Hey, can you put these in the changing room?

405
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,120
The women's right?

406
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,330
You're crazy. Just leave it.

407
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,120
It's Ma Jin Joo from the history department.

408
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,100
What are you going to do when Ye Rim finds out? You worked so hard on getting her to fall for you.

409
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Do you think I would? I just play with her.

410
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,990
Just look at her. She looks great.

411
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,390
But she has no money you know?

412
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,590
She's perfect to play around with.

413
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,570
Also Ye Rim's my lifetime supply of money. Do you think I'd lose her?

414
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,730
He's such a piece of work.

415
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,620
Entrance to Shower Stalls

416
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,610
- What is this?
- Oh!

417
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,400
Oh, I'm so sorry! I thought you were my friend.

418
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,080
You pushed me so hard.

419
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm sorry!

420
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:03,310
Seo Young, I'm so sorry. What a waste of a ticket.

421
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,120
It's okay. I'll just watch it by myself. You can go.

422
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,280
- Sorry.
- It's okay, you can go.

423
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,490
- Okay, bye!
- Bye.

424
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,550
Try it. Can't you do ballet to hip hop music?

425
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,880
♬Yeah yeah ♬

441
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,840
Hey, it worked out. Why'd you stop?

442
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,910
It didn't really work. I was just doing it for fun.

443
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,810
You should do it for work. Then later it becomes fun work.

444
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,220
What?

445
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,060
When you live life, it's hard to find what you like to do.

446
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,710
It's hard to find something you have to do that's the same as what you want to do.

447
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,730
When that doesn't work, you make it that way.

448
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,260
If you put all your eggs in one basket, then when that basket is gone, there's nothing else you can do.

449
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,720
If it's something fun to do, the fun is what lasts.

450
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,620
Your words flow like a poet.

451
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,010
It's true.

452
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,340
Later what if you get injured and can't anymore?

453
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,020
There's nothing that's forever.

454
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,640
So, just do what you want from time to time.

455
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,200
Is that true?

456
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,380
With that in mind, what do you want to do right now?

457
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,730
Here you go.

458
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,630
Why are you giving me it already? Just follow me.

459
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,720
You lied, then! You don't even look hurt.

460
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,060
Your leg looks fine.

461
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,970
I'm going to the hospital right now.

462
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,020
The hospital? Oh, I'm sorry.

463
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,350
You should give me your bag, then. I can hold it.

464
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,140
I'm stronger than you think.

465
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,890
It must really hurt.

466
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,930
Is it true? You're really going to see a movie with me?

467
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,160
Well, my friends canceled on me, so..

468
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,360
This is my third time telling you this.

469
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,960
What?

470
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,240
Geez!

471
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,320
- Are you okay?
- Yeah..

472
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,380
♫  I'm falling in love with you..  ♫

473
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,520
♫ In the light of your beautiful eyes ♫

474
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,340
♫  I don't want to hide it anymore.  ♫

475
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Hold onto me.

476
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,200
♫  Let's always walk together.  ♫

477
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,230
If you fall, only you will lose out.

478
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,020
♫  I'll come one step closer...  ♫

479
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,230
♫  Like that, I keep smiling.  ♫

480
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:33,690
♫ I'll walk slowly, awkward in love. ♫

481
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,120
Would you look at my veins!

482
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,690
Yes, Choi Ban Do. This is manly.

483
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,260
This is the theater?

484
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,820
It has to be here, right?

485
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,590
It would only be here, right?

486
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,850
Yeah. Because it was reserved for here.

487
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,770
No way... It's a big theater. Would I bump into them?

488
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,600
That'll be ₩3000.

489
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,110
Ah, okay.

490
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,040
What!

491
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,630
I have to go to the bathroom.

492
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,950
Here it is.

493
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,790
Why does it have to be here? I'm screwed.

494
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:51,340
No, that's not it. Did I commit a sin? It's not like I'm cheating.

495
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:54,420
Okay, Choi Ban Do. Be confident!

496
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,830
Straighten your shoulders! Yeah! Let's go!

497
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,240
It's not like I committed a sin.

498
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,430
Okay, then.

499
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,800
What is this? Why is she here?

500
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,610
The mother's friend's kid?

501
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,450
Did you do something wrong? What happened?

502
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,720
You said you were going to the hospital. Why come here?

503
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,060
I thought it'd more fun if I saw a movie with someone.

504
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,830
Look. I knew you were faking it.

505
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,540
This shouldn't be happening.

506
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,070
Sorry, sorry. I had to use the bathroom. It was urgent.

507
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,020
Ooh, it's so good!

508
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:10,370
Oh, right. Remember when you confessed to me?

509
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,450
That wasn't a confess-

510
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,800
Oh, yeah. When you asked me to date you.

511
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
Yeah.

512
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,770
It's been some time right?

513
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,470
Your first love is me.

514
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,960
I don't have a first love, but I was a first love to someone.

515
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,730
- To who?
- You don't believe me?

516
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,640
An upperclassman who was a history major. He's really hot and rich. Handsome too.

517
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,210
I got a confession from him.

518
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,250
Really? This woman... you've watched so many K-dramas you're making things up now.

519
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:44,010
Are you writing a drama? Why would a guy whose handsome, rich, and tall like you? Did he got shot?

520
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,910
It's true!

521
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,170
This ajumma's gotten bipolar hasn't she?

522
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,610
It's you. The one who got shot. The mother's friend's son.

523
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,070
What? Did he get shot like ten times??

524
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,020
Okay. It's better that she remained as his first love.

525
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,440
You haven't seen it, too, right?

526
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,580
Huh? Yeah. I haven't seen it.

527
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:13,280
I wonder how fun it is. I've heard it's really sad that people cry.

528
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,850
Well it'll probably be an obvious melodrama.

529
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,520
Who would cry at that?

530
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,230
1999 In Reality

531
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,030
Hey, don't do it!

532
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,370
2004

533
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,930
2017

534
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,120
No!!

535
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:56,980
Now that I think about it, it's been a while since I came here. I came here often in my college days.

536
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,970
You're still a college student. A freshman, too.

537
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,780
From time to time, you talk like an ajussi.

538
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,530
I'm not an ajussi.

539
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,880
No, I like it. I like you as an ajussi. It's comfortable.

540
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,690
Oh, you like it?

541
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,640
You're not crying.

542
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,430
We worked hard today.

543
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:12,420
Do guys normally dislike it if a girl kisses them first?

544
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,700
No! Boys love it! They're so thankful!

545
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,070
Hey, can you introduce me to her?

546
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,910
Hey, me first.

547
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,450
Then, what is he?

548
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,080
What if the girl asks him to date her first?

549
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,370
The girl first? Hey, that's a little..

550
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,490
What? Why does it matter who asks first?

551
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,230
Still, a man has his honor.

552
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,890
The girl should give the boy the chance for him to ask her to date him. Right?

553
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,110
Hey, guys. Have a drink!

554
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,760
Come fast! Why are you so late?

555
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,020
We started already. Come fast.

556
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,620
Quickly, quickly.

557
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:52,820
To boys, his first love lasts forever.

558
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,140
When did you have your first love?

559
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,120
During middle school. I liked a girl from my church.

560
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,710
- What about you, Jae Woo?
- Me?

561
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,270
Me? In preschool. I got so nervous and all that.

562
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,920
Seriously?

563
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,980
They say a fair face may hide a foul heart.

564
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,910
I'm a bit mature, you know...

565
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,640
That's unrequited love you idiots. Did you go out with them?

566
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,960
No, how can I go out with my ethics teacher...

567
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,650
She didn't even know me.

568
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,010
Why is it first love? It's unrequited love.

569
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,990
I think you guys are mistaken. Your first love isn't the person you first like.

570
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:42,750
It's the first person you date. Men and women need to date for it to be love.

571
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:48,830
It needs to be both ways. If not it's just an one-sided love.

572
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,660
Unrequited love!

573
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,330
No, that's not it. It's first love to me.

574
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,960
My heart still beats for her.

575
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,070
If we aren't even dating, why'd she kiss me?

576
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,090
Why is it hard to ask someone to date them?

577
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,740
Waiting like this will give me cancer.

578
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,310
Ahn Jae Woo. If you walk one more step, we're over.

579
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,590
Did we even start anything?

580
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,960
- We didn't even date. There's nothing to end, it was unrequited love.
- What?

581
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,310
What?

582
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,720
Sure, you could kiss someone you aren't dating.

583
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,910
But, it's not like that for me.

584
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,200
Why would you kiss someone you aren't even dating?

585
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,120
It could be nothing to you, but for me

586
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,320
- You're my first love.
- Ha.

587
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,490
You said your first love was from preschool. You said you got so nervous!

588
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,930
How would I remember that? And, you're the one who said that if you're not dating someone, it's unrequited love.

589
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,340
Yeah. So I guess it must be unrequited love.

590
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,260
No, I said you're my first love!

591
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,920
Then, what do you want to do with me?

592
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,880
What?

593
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,820
What do you want to do with me?

594
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:42,710
I want to date you. Not unrequited love. I want to date.

595
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:51,600
You definitely said it, okay? You asked me to date you.

596
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,200
You didn't cry.

597
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,680
How sad was that love story for me to cry?

598
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,920
There's a lot of things in life to cry about otherwise.

599
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,670
Did you cry?

600
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,020
Excuse me.

601
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,480
Hello, Father-in--

602
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,230
Who are you?

603
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,790
A passerby.

604
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,700
Oh, my.

605
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:39,410
He's an upperclassman who's a history major. Just an upperclassman.

606
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,330
He's my dad.

607
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,430
Hello, I'm Jung Nam Gil.

608
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,700
Give me it now.

609
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,770
Uh.. I hurt my leg, so..

610
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,160
Don't imagine anything weird. He's just an upperclassman.

611
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,470
An upperclassman. Nice to meet you.

612
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,810
Jin Joo. Dad's leaving now. You want to come?

613
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,960
No. You can go first.

614
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,490
Okay. Then, have fun.

615
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,660
You want to spend more time with me?

616
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:25,360
How can you just get cured with just one diagnosis from Dr. Han Seok Gyu (actor han seok gyu played a doctor in a movie that was popular back then, and he was the lead again in this movie they both saw)?

617
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,330
Then, I'm going to take it that you're not hurting anymore.

618
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,460
Ma Jin Joo.

619
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:38,750
I picked something up, so I was going to the police station. Won't you come with me?

620
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,380
What was that earlier?

621
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,850
What?

622
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,100
Oh, I thought he was someone I knew.

623
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,050
Oh, he was a father-in-law?

624
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,810
What? A master of furniture?

625
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,520
A leather master? What kind of master (sounds similar)?

626
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,180
Yeah, he's a father-in-law, but... What kind he is... Uh..

627
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,020
Wow!

628
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,680
Anyone who wants to have fun with us can come out!

629
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,730
She's here!

630
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:14,130
It's ballet!
♫ Tiger is in the presence bam bam (hey)
Upon the raggae is bam bam (hey) ♫

631
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:19,470
♫ Tiger is in the pregence bam bam (hey)
Upon the raggae is bam bam (hey) ♫

632
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:44,560
♫  When we first met, it was a bit awkward. ♫

633
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,490
♫  A bit awkward.♫

634
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,140
♫ Your smiling eyes  ♫

635
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,280
It works! Ballet to hip hop music.

636
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,010
I think it works because they did it with me. Right?

637
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:55,880
Was it fun?

638
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,650
Yeah. Great fun!

639
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,630
I did the right thing by pushing you, right?

640
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,120
It's fate.

641
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,810
Yeah. Sure it's fate. How we watched a movie, too.

642
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:11,140
I'm quite confident practice really makes perfect.

643
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,730
♫  I wanted to say this to you. ♫

644
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,520
♫ You were surprising. ♫

645
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,470
♫ Baby, in your bright eyes,♫

646
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:26,160
♫  Forever I want to ♫

647
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,200
♫  put you in my heart. ♫

648
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,150
♫  Your lovely voice ♫

649
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,170
♫  like a rain shower, ♫

650
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:42,050
♫  I want to be drenched in you. ♫

651
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,920
I lost it in a taxi.

652
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,000
I picked it up in the school's parking lot.

653
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,380
But how did you know it was mine? It's not like there was any id.

654
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,950
I asked other students.

655
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,830
But is that how you should act towards someone who found you something?

656
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:23,090
Well... Thank you.

657
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,230
So I'll buy this. But the fractured leg, no matter how I think of it is a lie.

658
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:32,010
You must care a lot about whether my leg hurts or not.

659
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:34,020
Because if it's true, I'll feel sorry.

660
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:37,970
It's worrying! I don't want to hurt someone else's precious child.

661
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,940
You look rich. If you were hurt, you could've gone to the hospital.

662
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,670
Me? Where?

663
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,640
Do you not look in the mirror?

664
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,930
From head to toe, you're wearing luxurious clothes. And that watch.

665
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:54,760
The car too. You're surrounded by money.

666
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,020
Nice catch.

667
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,910
But even if I put on these things, they don't really know.

668
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,090
Are you a materialistic girl?

669
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,690
No, well not...Don't most...

670
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,600
Kids these days could probably be unaware.

671
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,250
Strange.

672
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,020
Are you a split personality or something?

673
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:40,760
Or are your lachrymal glands damaged that you keep crying or something?

674
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,460
What are you saying?

675
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,270
♫  I'm thinking in love... ♫

676
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:59,660
What's he doing? I feel like I'm under pressure.

677
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,910
♫ You are very sweet. ♫

678
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,170
Since you found my wallet, I'll pay for this.

679
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:14,730
Is there something you like?

680
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,860
You.
♫

681
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,730
♫ In the light of your beautiful eyes ♫

682
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,150
I think I'm right.

683
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,620
♫ I'm thrilled. ♫

684
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,850
I like you.

685
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:37,330
♫  Let's always walk together. Open your closed heart. ♫

686
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:48,140
♫  I get one step closer... Like that, I keep smiling. ♫

687
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:54,250
♫  I'll approach slowly. Love that is ♫

688
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,110
I could've walked here by myself. You took me home even though your leg hurts.

689
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,450
It's healed now, after I watched the movie.

690
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:04,670
Then, you'll be fine tomorrow.

691
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,560
Even though you looked fine today, too.

692
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,190
I'm going.

693
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,790
Okay.

694
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,280
You can sit down.

695
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,890
So. You're the same major as her. What grade?

696
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,260
I'm in my last year.

697
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,450
- So, you're going to graduate soon?
- Yes.

698
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:03,900
What did you do after the movies?

699
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,490
What? Oh, we had a glass of beer.

700
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,830
One glass? Really just one?

701
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:15,150
No, I had around four. Jin Joo had around three.

702
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:20,940
Three? She drinks three? Glasses? or in 500mL pints?

703
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,140
500mL.

704
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:27,120
You do drink a lot. What about your parents?

705
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,590
That.. they work in education. So...

706
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,870
Well, you don't have to tell me if you don't feel like it.

707
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,930
To be honest, he's the director of the school.

708
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:45,080
Of Hangook University? The one that Jin Joo attends?

709
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,440
Yes.

710
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,100
Please don't let Jin Joo know. No one knows this.

711
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,850
Okay. Don't tell Jin Joo we met, either.

712
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:59,630
- Keep it between us men. Okay?
- Yes.

713
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:03,100
- So... Do you like her a lot?
- What?

714
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:08,690
Do you like our Jin Joo a lot? Enough to watch a movie with her, drink about four pints.

715
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:17,270
Ah, yes. Some. No. I like her a lot.

716
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,430
Hi.

717
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,020
Why are you here? Do you not have an umbrella?

718
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:59,350
It wasn't raining when I came here. Is there somewhere to buy one?

719
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,200
No need to buy one. There's one here.

720
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,800
Let's use it. Come on.

721
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:20,040
Don't cry after eating. Why are you always crying? It's like someone I know.

722
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,730
How can an umbrella be so poorly constructed!

723
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,700
Just fold it. It's through.

724
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,400
Then until the humanities hall.

725
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:47,450
This small thing, is so sly.

726
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:52,950
He's making an old woman's heart flutter... Is he a playboy?

727
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,680
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

728
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,030
Can you come in closer to me?

729
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,830
Look at this! I'm right.

730
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,920
If we walk like this, I get wet.

731
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,500
It's my umbrella you know.

732
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,060
Sorry, sorry.

733
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:27,670
The rain will end soon, right?

734
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,960
Probably.

735
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,440
It's the festival you know.

736
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,730
1999 In Reality

737
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:16,920
I'll pour you one myself.

738
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,600
After you graduate, what will you do?

739
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,620
Anything to help Jin Joo to not starve.

740
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:32,000
So, what? What do you like? Or want to do?

741
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,220
What I like? It's Jin Joo. So.. Whatever Jin Joo likes..

742
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,000
I'll... Yeah.

743
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,620
What kind of man has no dreams!

744
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,090
No, I do! Having a kid with Jin Joo and living happily with her.

745
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,040
- That's my dream.
- What?

746
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,380
Seeing me, doesn't mean you can meet Jin Joo. This is just round one.

747
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,700
You know right? The review of application materials.

748
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,830
You have a long way to go, preliminaries, the final round etc.

749
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:04,910
Yes! I will never give up! I'll make it to the end.

750
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:09,780
Don't laugh! I'll get attached to you. I'll lose my sense of objective judgment.

751
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:14,020
Yes, I'm sorry, Father.

752
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,530
Why am I your father?

753
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,590
Then... Father-in-law?

754
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:22,100
Father-in-law?

755
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:27,810
Then? Ahjusshi.

756
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:34,930
♬ All I know is how to live. ♬

757
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:41,850
♬ More than that, the trials and tribulations ♬

758
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:49,770
♬are what cannot be avoided. That's what I realized. ♬

759
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,020
♬ Now the solution is love. ♬

760
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,370
Go Back Couple Episode 6 Preview

761
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,620
Hey, you don't know when you'll go back in time. You already seduced a boy?

762
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,730
You're stuck by his side.

763
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,030
Speak for yourself.

764
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,860
For someone who hasn't even shown his face the past three years at the festival. What's with him now?

765
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,630
Nam Gil, where are you coming from?

766
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,120
Are you hungry?

767
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,460
Hey! Ma Jin Joo!

768
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,860
Is there something wrong? The May Queen fled.

769
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,830
What do you mean you're the May Queen?

770
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,620
It'll be a relief if she doesn't get last place.

771
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,510
Humanities, Ma Jin Joo!

772
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:23,020
Isn't that her? The girl you're trying to play?

773
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:26,480
Go make a move, you're gonna lose her!
