1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,360
What could it be?

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,660
Seo Jin, shh.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,640
That's right.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,200
- Hey!
- What? Hey, hey, hey. Come quickly and see.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,390
I don't think a woman will come. Kim Jong Min will be stood up.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,100
I think Kim Jong Min will be stood up.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,380
Why did you turn it off?

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,160
I told you to play with Seo Jin, and you're watching TV again?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,390
You want to watch the blind date of a celebrity you don't know?

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,090
I shudder just by hearing the name of this show! Because of you! You!

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,780
If I would have known all this would happen, I could've been living as a prosecutor right now.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,350
You think you are the only one with good memories?

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,000
Judges and investigators? Bull. You think studying hard will make anyone a prosecutor?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,970
People who are good at studying usually end up as prosecutors.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,420
Okay. Anyway ...

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,430
Look. You shouldn't have seduced me when we first met.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,870
You seduced me first. With your eyes like this.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,220
You kept blinking like that, so I thought you had an eye problem.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,660
Wow, this woman's remembering it wrong.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,670
You had your eyes on me first and made it seem like you would die if I didn't pick you. Truly.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,380
You were like this.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,090
You did that first! Staring at me.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,590
Do you not remember? I chose you because you scared me. Truly.

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,790
You seduced me first by doing this with your eyes.

25
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,860
You kept blinking like that!

26
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,010
That is not what happened.

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,580
Episode 2: Memories Are Only Remembered When It's Convenient To Do So.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,970
Oppa, you are heading to Professor Hwang's class, right?

29
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,840
I put a lot of effort in to get this from previous students.You should look at it.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,500
If you put in that much effort, you should use it yourself.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,100
Sunbae! This is a newly released one. You should have it.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,730
If it's new, you should have it.

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,290
I don't know whose household he comes from but he's basically gleaming.

34
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,750
They raised him well.

35
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,100
I left  that  kid and I went for that loser.

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Hello!

37
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,600
Oppa.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,710
You must be going to class.

39
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,150
"You must be going to class."
What then, did he come to play pool?

40
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,980
Are you out of your mind? Or are you suddenly lonely? You want to date?

41
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,000
Why? I said hi because i was happy to see him.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,620
You said hello because you were happy to see him? After you humiliated him yesterday?

43
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,310
What?

44
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,270
Look at him! He's so handsome!

45
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,080
You! Let's date.

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,740
He asked her out!

47
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,250
-I don't want to
- Why?

48
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,180
You smell like sweat.

49
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,470
What's wrong with her?

50
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,880
Poor him!

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,760
Wow, I can't believe this.

52
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,210
That's impossible. When did I do that?

53
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,060
You did that yesterday!

54
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,930
Wow! Yesterday you hated him and his sweat smell. Today you say hi you're happy to see him?

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,400
Wow! You're scary!

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,620
OMG! OMG!

57
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,010
Is that why he looked so hurt? Ugh, I don't know!

58
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,030
Why did I say that?

59
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,870
You would know, not me.

60
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,130
I mean, he had just finished playing sports so he would've smelled like sweat. You and your germophobia.

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,300
That's right!

62
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,700
Wow, I'm crazy. I'm really crazy. Crazy.

63
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,250
Are you sick?

64
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,260
It's not that kids these days are scary. Kids have  always  been scary.

65
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,210
Aren't you seniors?

66
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,730
No matter what happens, you must never pick a fight.

67
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:18,200
You must follow what you're supposed to do. The seniors will deal with other seniors!

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,910
Aigoo these bastards. At least they know "fair play."

69
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,870
I'm so tired. How long do I have to do this?
I think I'm going to die.

70
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,570
Seniors, when can we stop?

71
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,110
Stop being a wuss. Until the day a woman comes into this room,

72
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,080
you have to remain in this position.

73
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,370
What woman will come in here? That is basically telling us to stay like this forever.

74
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,370
It's a girl!

75
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,380
It's a girl!

76
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,660
♫  Will you remember the promise? ♫

77
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,520
Come in! Come in!

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,670
Come in! Come in!

79
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,190
♫ I believe. I believe. ♫

80
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,950
♫  Will you recognize my image since I've changed so much? ♫

81
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,590
I'm sorry I'm late!

82
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,750
This psycho

83
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,620
Dok Jae! Oh, right, your hair was like that!

84
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,460
All down!!

85
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,070
How could you say something like that?

86
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,520
Of course he would smell like sweat. He was working out.

87
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,740
How can I lose someone like that.

88
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,190
Aigoo, Ma Jin Joo. Aigoo, Ma Jin Joo.

89
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,140
Hello, Jin Joo!

90
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,540
What were their names? I think one was class rep.

91
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,970
- Hey you, come to the front!
- Yes.

92
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,190
No, it's not. It's her.

93
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,250
Hey!

94
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,590
Cheon Seol!

95
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,250
You're Cheon Seol, right?

96
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,410
What is wrong with you? Are you reuniting with lost family?

97
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,090
The professor came. Sit down.

98
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,100
Oh, right. We used to be really close back then.

99
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,680
But, she left and we stopped talking.

100
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,390
Did I do something wrong to her?

101
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,910
I don't know.

102
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,340
Did she make a mistake this morning? Everyone's been talking.

103
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,350
All these rumors...

104
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,360
Why did she leave without telling us that time?

105
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,990
Regent Heung Seon vs Empress Myeong Seong. Whose policy was best?

106
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,850
You guys prepared your presentations well, right?

107
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,480
Yes.

108
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,790
Wow, can you believe this? I'm in a class in school right now.

109
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:35,110
Today's topic will be Regent Heung Seon vs Empress Myeong Seong.

110
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,300
They were constantly fighting over different policies and having power struggles.

111
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,240
Even Empress Myeong Seong couldn't avoid conflict with the in-laws. I hate it.

112
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,470
This led to the downfall of Joseon Dynasty. Everyone, shall we make our presentation on our discussion?

113
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,280
So Queen Myeong Seong's supporters opposed Regent Heung Seon's policy of isolation and rejection

114
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,980
of diplomatic relations with other countries which was the main reason our modernization was delayed.

115
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,560
Oh, she's on the wife's side.

116
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,950
Yes, you will experience all this later.

117
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,900
Nice. Next group.

118
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,670
Let's see the next presentation.

119
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,780
Why?

120
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,610
- Hurry go!
- Where?

121
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,010
Who's the next presenter?

122
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,340
You're the presenter of our group. Hurry!

123
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,530
- Me?
- Hurry and go. Make the presentation.

124
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,940
Ma Jin Joo from Group 3?

125
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,400
I...forgot the entire contents of our discussion.

126
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,980
How long was it that you met with your group so that you would forget?

127
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,940
Then, just tell us your opinion. Is it Regent Heung Seon or Empress Myeong Seong?

128
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,870
Uh... I...

129
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,920
I think Go Jong was at fault. (Go Jong was the son of Regent Heung Seon and the husband of Queen Myeong Seong).

130
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,000
Go Jong? Why?

131
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,740
Well, his wife and his father were fighting. King Go Jong should've stepped forward.

132
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,290
The husband should've quickly stepped forward and moved out.

133
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,690
But, this is the palace during the Joseon Dynasty.

134
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,640
Oh, yes. But, anyway, whenever you look at those families, it's always the husband's fault.

135
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,870
The husband should've mediated between them... I mean, how could a wife win against her father-in-law?

136
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:04,660
Can the wife fit to accommodate for everyone's needs? Is the wife a puzzle to fit everything perfectly?

137
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,260
We?

138
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,250
So you think the dynasty fell because of Go Jong?

139
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,640
Of course not, just something like that..

140
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,330
What a refreshing opinion. I like it.

141
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,000
So, who are the members of Group 3?

142
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,300
F. Lacked an understanding of topic during debate.

143
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,390
What did you do?

144
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,370
Well, how could I remember something from so long ago?

145
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,480
But, the debate was yesterday.

146
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,500
Okay, we'll just go along with the fact that you forgot the debate.

147
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,720
But what? Go Jong?

148
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,730
She asked my opinion. You guys don't know but father-in-laws can be worse that mothers-in-law.

149
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,680
He's so picky, he doesn't eat kimchi that has fish sauce in it.

150
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,780
- Ugh, I thought of him again.
- Who?

151
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,980
There's someone like that. A father-in-law who acts like a mother-in-law.

152
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,080
Give me one.

153
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,030
Fish sauce? Don't you know I only eat kimchi with anchovy sauce?

154
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,710
I'm not eating it! Make it again.

155
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm living with a mother-in-law!

156
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,840
Isn't it too harsh?

157
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,640
I thought she wanted my opinion. I can't believe this.

158
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,940
I  can't believe this.

159
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,260
Is this your concept today?

160
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,900
Movie Club

161
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,600
Wow, it's been so long since I saw this film.

162
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:09,430
Oh this one is here too!

163
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,620
Brad Pitt!

164
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,940
Oh, I remember! Your hairstyle's inspired by Brad Pitt's.

165
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:26,330
You, young punks. When will I see this again?

166
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,520
You're so cute!

167
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,270
What is this?

168
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,810
Aww, so cute!

169
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,700
Wow, to see how you guys looked again when you were young.

170
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,970
I will kill him!

171
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,160
Hey, I can't believe you did that to a senior.

172
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,240
No. Him.

173
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,970
You! Did you drink during the day? Why would you laugh there?

174
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,650
Do you see my hand shaking? I lost my hand because of you.

175
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,540
Are you that bored with life? Were you trying to make a spectacle?

176
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,680
Aigoo. This Hyung is living something spectacular indeed.

177
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,480
What is that crazy guy saying? Are you not sober?

178
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,450
Okay. Sounds good. I'll explain everything.

179
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:27,480
Listen to me well, kids. I don't know what's going on right now, either. But what I appear to be is not the whole truth.

180
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,180
I look like Choi Ban Do right now, right? But I'm not the Choi Ban Do that you think you know.

181
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,450
If you're not Ma Jin Joo right now, then who are you?

182
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,660
So, I'm not 20 right now. I suddenly came to the past!

183
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,050
How do I remember something that happened 18 years ago?

184
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,380
You're 38, then?

185
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,170
Ha! With that face?

186
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,500
Well, my face is still the same. When I woke up this morning, I became 20 and it was the year 1999!

187
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Ah, I see. So it's like time traveling. Like that movie  Back to the Future .

188
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,030
That's right.  Back to the Future.  It's exactly that. I knew you were smart.

189
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,350
So what I am like in the future?

190
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,270
You?

191
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,150
Hold on. It won't stop trembling. Massage it.

192
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,520
Hey, how much do you have to work out to have that kind of body?

193
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,090
Be easy, we don't recover at this age.

194
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,010
What is hopeless is your bodies.

195
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,670
Oh!

196
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,310
Do some exercise!...my batting skills are still good, right?

197
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,850
but the director keep saying I lost it

198
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,550
I have to go this time. To the Korean Series.

199
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,170
Cheering Fairy

200
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,690
You'll get healthier. Really healthy.

201
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,210
What about him?

202
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,740
Does he still go around like this?

203
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,470
Hey, his hair will fall out!

204
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,210
- Get a haircut!
- Shut it.

205
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,640
Don't say that. No Dok Jae, do whatever you want with your hair.

206
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,900
Just don't shave it.

207
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,210
What are you saying?

208
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,410
What about me? Do I have a girlfriend?

209
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,640
Is there a girlfriend?

210
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,720
Yes

211
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,540
I got a yacht.

212
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,250
Darling?

213
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,790
Only a girlfriend? No. A wife, too.

214
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,710
I become an aerobics teacher?

215
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,350
Me?

216
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,680
Let's go everyone!

217
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,370
Your husband's in front of you! Hit him hard!

218
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,130
That's it!

219
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,360
Next, kick him! Higher!

220
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,350
One! Two!

221
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,570
Not exactly an aerobics teacher but, something similar to that.

222
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,180
This seems unbelievable.

223
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:20,310
Well, I don't know what's happening to me, either. Up until yesterday night, that tightwad-

224
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,060
Anyhow, just imagine how surprised I am with this situation.

225
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,850
I can't tell you guys about the pain I experienced before I recover from it.

226
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,540
If you ever think I'm being strange, just remember I'm from the future and be understanding.

227
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,160
Oh. You have injuries, too.

228
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,670
We didn't even know you were like that.

229
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,510
No, don't worry.

230
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,110
What a crazy guy.

231
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,010
She's crazy. She gone completely crazy.

232
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,150
Is she pulling an April Fool's prank again? She's gone crazy from studying too much.

233
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,410
Now he's lying about anything.

234
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,680
Is the time machine in your house?

235
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,000
We should go see it.

236
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

237
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,240
People who are good at studying are the best at creating detailed lies.

238
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,740
Who would believe what I am saying?

239
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,500
Wait for me! I don't know how to get there.

240
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,320
Who would believe me?

241
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,450
Those little bastards. Let's go together!

242
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,950
Hey, I don't know the way!

243
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,470
Excuse me.

244
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,380
♬ From the start it was easier to be alone.  ♬

245
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,300
I kept on watching you earlier. Because you're pretty.

246
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,420
♬ In a time of free choice ♬

247
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,570
Me? Really?

248
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,940
Yes.

249
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,640
If you don't mind me asking, could you give me your number?

250
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,690
Oh, my. What is this?

251
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,850
He thinks I'm pretty!

252
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,960
Uh.. I don't have a phone or pager.

253
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,510
Oh, you don't. Then, what about your home phone?

254
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,250
Home phone? What was it? How could I remember?

255
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,550
I don't really know...

256
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,740
I'm not doing it on purpose. I just don't know.

257
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,270
Then, can you tell me your major and the area you live in?

258
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,770
Oh, my. Excuse me! I have a pager here.

259
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,920
Isn't it that the freshman English major? Did you reject him?

260
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,500
Just give out your number. It's not like you will start dating just because you give it to him.

261
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,320
Pretty girls just...

262
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,490
He really said I was pretty!

263
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,220
If I pass by, he says, "You look pretty today, as well."

264
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,850
He's probably doing that to make you buy something.

265
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,420
Who's pretty? You? Are you on some drug?

266
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:46,710
No, even when he's with other women, he says it to me.

267
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,870
Because you look the dumbest out of all of them.

268
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,010
No, it's not that. He really did it because I'm pretty!

269
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,580
He was always here somewhere.

270
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:09,210
♫  Whenever I see you, everything stops.  ♫

271
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,770
♫  I don't even know when it started.  ♫

272
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,170
You're still very pretty today, too.

273
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,730
Oh, thank you.

274
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,260
If you don't mind me asking, can we talk really quick?

275
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,760
Yes.

276
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,950
♬ And I felt that this is fate ♬

277
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,890
A picture book to make the brain a creative playground!

278
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,940
This is an English study book. It's hard to get in Gangnam, as well.

279
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,750
I feel like you're the type of mom to teach her children well.

280
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,290
Today, I'll give you 50% off.

281
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,920
At that kind of price, it's like I'm just giving it to you for free.

282
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,180
Wow this mom's skin is very pretty!

283
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,900
You have such a bright face! Oh, it's so bright and perfect.

284
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,450
This is hard to get in Gangnam. And you are so pretty.

285
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,870
And I think you'll teach your kids well. So, I'll give you 50% off.

286
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:10,200
But, this mom's skin is so nice!

287
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,150
Oh!

288
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,870
Oh, there were this many pretty women here? I thought it was only you.

289
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,780
Anyway, he's handsome and good at selling. He'll have great success!

290
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,680
Let's go in, Pretty Woman #1.

291
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,810
Guys.

292
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,280
I'm truly pretty, right?

293
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,590
Let's go. You need to be punished.

294
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,940
Hey!

295
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,080
Soda, 300 won

296
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,610
Ahn Jae. Ban Do.

297
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,440
- Thank you!
- Drink this and come back to your senses.

298
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,060
What is that? Nostradamus?

299
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,350
(Signs about Nostradamus' predictions)

300
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,460
Oh, that's right. Now that I'm thinking about it, who would believe this?

301
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,660
Have you decided?

302
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,720
What? Decide what?

303
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,740
July 24th, the last day. What are you going to do?

304
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,520
Hey, don't believe this. It's a lie.

305
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,770
A lie? The planets are lining up and there's going to be an apocalypse.

306
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,460
The planets could collide and we could die. Or a war could break out.

307
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,730
Don't even mention it. The unusual pattern in our climate is because something out there is trying to control us and eliminate some of the human population.

308
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,720
- We could all be wiped out.
- Be quiet! I can't focus.

309
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,410
Hey. You guys stay here.

310
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,750
Where are you going?

311
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,390
Madam.

312
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,890
Ow! It hurts.

313
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,150
Are you crazy? How dare you touch her?

314
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,360
With one punch I think I convinced her.

315
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,670
She seemed dumb so she was easy to seduce.

316
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,240
I think I ended this affair with that punch.

317
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,220
Hey.

318
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,250
You are here.

319
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,350
You bastard, I said you were dead when I met you in college.

320
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,030
You're dead.

321
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,270
A medical student's night occurs only once a year. What a shame.

322
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:51,260
Right? It's a shame. But, what can I do? I have to study.

323
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,880
Oh! I'm so sorry. I was thinking about something else.

324
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,330
Hey! Look where you're going!

325
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,220
No, it's fine. It's fine. That could happen.

326
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,160
Wow, I'm so sorry. What should I do? Oh, drink this.

327
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,030
Oh, okay.

328
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,980
I'm sorry.

329
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,170
Gosh, you're so... nice!

330
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,680
Why would I make a big deal? He didn't do it intentionally.

331
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,280
I said he was dead.

332
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,240
It's a bit of a shame he had his glasses on. It would've hit him directly.

333
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,480
Ramen ₩800

334
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,920
Dish with rice, soup, and sides. ₩1500

335
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,880
No way. ₩1500?

336
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,600
It's ₩1500?

337
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,830
It's so cheap!

338
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,780
You could buy a bag of chips with that money!

339
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,130
Hey!

340
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,630
We demand an explanation, Chief Director!

341
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,940
Meal prices increased!

342
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,460
Explain, Chief Director!

343
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,880
Are you eating chips covered in gold? How is this the price of chips?

344
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,840
This is good.

345
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,420
Why aren't you eating?

346
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,860
Oh. You keep eating.

347
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,540
I'm full.

348
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,870
You're full? I'll eat it.

349
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,450
Me too.

350
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,010
It doesn't taste like anything

351
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,300
How is your short rib soup? Let me try.

352
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,700
Since they made it in big amounts for a long time, it tastes better.

353
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,190
If you make it at home, it doesn't taste like this.

354
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,430
Did you starve for weeks? You usually don't eat this.

355
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,500
Why are you eating so fast?

356
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,810
You should try having a child.

357
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,160
What?

358
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,500
A child?

359
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,880
No, no. It's nothing.

360
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,140
Eat up, it is yummy.

361
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,890
Wow, I feel like my stomach's going to explode. I ate well.

362
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,960
You used to say that you didn't feel happy when you were full.

363
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,340
Being full is the good times.

364
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,370
Whether it goes in to your mouth or nose, eating to live while raising a child is sorrowful.

365
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,870
What?

366
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,830
Okay. Our Jin Joo had to change. Good thinking.

367
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,520
Oh. Oh, yeah.

368
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,200
Hey, what should we do after we eat?

369
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Why are you asking like you're a stranger?

370
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,460
Why? What are we doing?

371
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,780
A blind date!

372
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,220
A blind date? The date that I'm thinking of?

373
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,900
What's wrong with you?

374
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,630
Yes!

375
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,120
Why are we crossing paths again? Let's not get involved with each other.

376
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,930
Ugh, Ma Jin Joo. Let's not cross paths.

377
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,160
Why is she here?

378
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,640
What is this? No way...

379
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,800
The first day I met her?

380
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,560
The first day I met this punk?

381
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,700
Let's see how many successful matches are made.

382
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,200
Hey, are their eyebrows supposed to be seagulls?

383
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,690
And, why do all of their lips look bruised?

384
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,020
Did you bring that bomb here?

385
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,720
Did you see their hair? It's like a stoplight. Red, green... What is this?

386
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,020
Yeah, but look at him.

387
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,410
That scared me.

388
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,890
Right, I met Ma Jin Joo at this blind date.

389
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,600
Ugh, why is that day today?

390
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,470
Wait, no. This is good.

391
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:29,380
I'll just not get involved with her forever.

392
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,890
Why are even my dreams nightmares?

393
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,950
I've been cursed for my whole life because of this day, child.

394
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,530
Let's not get involved.
Let's not get involved.

395
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,830
Don't get involved with me.

396
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,500
You should have it first.

397
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,890
Okay.

398
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,160
Let's not get involved.
Let's not get involved.

399
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,250
Okay, should we introduce ourselves now?

400
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm a First Year Civil Engineering major, Eom Won Hee. Not Mother (eomeoni), it's Eom Won Hee.

401
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,980
I'm a First Year Civil Engineering major. I call myself the Kim Won Joon level of handsome. I'm Lee Dae Young.

402
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,340
I'm Go Dok Jae.

403
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,160
Don't call me Dok Jae, but Go Dok.

404
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,820
I'm An Jae Woo.

405
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,330
I like to listen to the radio. And my special talent, well..

406
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,060
I'm trying to decide.

407
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,610
Hey, it's a cockroach!

408
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,090
Where?

409
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,350
That's my friend's special talent. His fast speed.

410
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,090
You mischievous guy.

411
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,540
I just need to not get involved with her.

412
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm a civil engineering major, Choi Ban Do.

413
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,980
I'm from Byunsanban-do, so I'm Choi Ban Do.

414
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,440
I am always thankful to my parents for not calling me Byunsan. (Byun = poop)

415
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,420
Done.

416
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,850
You're just poop. A pile of poop.

417
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,320
So, I think we're done with the boys. Let's move on to the girls.

418
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,030
Yeah. Bo Reum, we'll start with you.

419
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,460
How do you know my name?

420
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,660
Huh?

421
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,600
Oh, it says it right there. Yoon Bo Reum.

422
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,860
Yoon Bo Reum.

423
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh, Yoon Bo Reum

424
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,600
Oh, that was a close call. It slipped out without me knowing.

425
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,920
Geez, that scared me.

426
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,550
Since we are the same age, let's drop formal language. I am freshman history major Yoon Bo Ruem.

427
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,390
Why would he pick a painful love? You can't, my friend.

428
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm a history major, Cheon Seol.

429
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,360
I'm a history major, too. Go Eun Bee.

430
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:18,240
Hey, there's something in your face. I see a bit of Suzy.

431
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,280
Kang Suzy?
Kang Suzy?

432
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,470
Oh, that's not the Suzy I was talking about. There's a young and pretty Suzy I know.

433
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,680
You guys will know later on in life.

434
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,370
No way.

435
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,400
I'm a history major. Seol Hyeon.

436
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,740
What? (Today, Seol Hyeon is a pretty celebrity)

437
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,600
Seol Hyeon.

438
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm a history major. I'm Ma Jin Joo.

439
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,780
You are responsible for the bomb. Take care of the bomb properly ok.

440
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,460
What do you mean by "getting rid of the bomb?" It's not like you are a kid anymore. Just let things happen.

441
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,200
Today's your turn!

442
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,860
My turn?

443
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:20,290
How do I know which item belongs to the bomb. It's not like their names are written on it.

444
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,300
If I don't know, I can't do it.

445
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,690
Why are you acting like you don't know? Is it your first or second blind date?

446
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,580
Do it correctly.

447
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,650
Why has she been staring at me? It's scary.

448
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,240
No way. Has she...picked me?

449
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,480
Oh that is right, she is the one who flirted so much with me back then.

450
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,170
Isn't this why I ended up this way.

451
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,320
Kiddo, you are scaring oppa.

452
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,370
Suzy... Suzy.

453
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,380
So, who's picking first?

454
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,440
Because of Yoon Bo Reum, my life...

455
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,320
I hate that day so much. I wish I had gone to hell instead.

456
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,150
I pity myself so much.

457
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,810
She ruined my life!

458
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,940
Jae Woo, you're choosing your fate. I'll help you.

459
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,640
Oh, what is this? What the?

460
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,380
Hey, you chose the giraffe!

461
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,480
Oh, Suzy!

462
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,720
It's mine.

463
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,980
What? How is it yours? It's Suzy's!

464
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,170
Even if you like him, you have to follow the rules.

465
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,210
I usually wear 2 different earrings.

466
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,650
So you're saying you use this one?

467
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,210
It's hers.

468
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,260
- What?
- It's hers. Not mine.

469
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,010
These little...

470
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,030
I've heard there are people who wear 2 different earrings.

471
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,990
Be quiet. You don't know how she'll affect your life. Don't choose her.

472
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,570
What are you saying?

473
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,830
Well, would you look at this.

474
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,040
There's still two left. Ban Do, you can go.

475
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,470
Choi Ban Do. You came, too?

476
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,380
So, you rejected me?

477
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,020
Are you saying you want to start a new life?

478
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,860
Ah, what's wrong with her?

479
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,250
You and I cannot meet! Let's not get involved.

480
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,520
I owe you, Ban Do. I'll pay my debt at the next meeting.

481
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,020
He doesn't want to get involved with me, huh?

482
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,300
You traitor!

483
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,970
What? I got rid of the bomb!

484
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,400
Bomb? Is she a bomb to you?

485
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,010
The flying flower pig is a bomb!

486
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,460
You..you. The girl I chose is a bomb! She's the dynamite.

487
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,110
Her personality sucks. She's a shopaholic, has mysophobia, and has anger issues.

488
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,740
She's the perfect bomb!

489
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,540
Anger issues? What's that?

490
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,580
What is that, you bastard?

491
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,020
There's something like that. When you have a bad personality and you get mad whenever.

492
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,790
But... how do you know that?

493
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,260
How do I know? Because I've lived with...

494
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,810
Lived?

495
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:02,430
I heard it! Everyone knows it except for you.

496
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,250
Get out.

497
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,460
Is that so?

498
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,040
Everyone knows? Then why don't I know?

499
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,130
I have a weird feeling about this...

500
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,250
- Hey. But, still, the Flower Pig!
- Hey!

501
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,140
Let's split up. We'll head out first.

502
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,430
Thanks.

503
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,640
It's nothing.

504
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,130
We'll leave, too.

505
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,060
But, where's Dok Jae and his partner?

506
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,880
Flying flower pig? Hey.

507
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,220
Are you crazy?

508
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,450
Why are you calling me a bomb?

509
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,520
Jae Woo!

510
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,810
Hey. Look at me properly.

511
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,830
I'm going to drink. Follow me.

512
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,390
He rejected me earlier. What is this situation?

513
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:45,700
I chose her to reject her so we wouldn't get involved with each other.

514
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,550
Are you two not leaving?

515
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,570
Huh? Well...soon

516
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,840
Looking from here, she actually does look pretty.

517
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,960
You should've grown up like this, woman.

518
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,460
This bastard...does he by chance want to be together again?

519
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,030
With me? He's crazy.

520
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,710
Oh, oh, I'm crazy. I must be crazy. This can't be.

521
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,990
Let's end this right here.

522
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,710
Excuse me, Ma Jin Joo.

523
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,770
Looking at you, I see that you have to be studying right now.

524
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,880
Ma Jin Joo, you're good at studying right?

525
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,420
A woman who stays at home with her kid has no charm. What would she do?

526
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,780
You're never full even if you eat.

527
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,880
Then, what? You find a husband who earns money like a gum seller.

528
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,930
Hurrah for that!

529
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:40,470
Living with you was like being tortured and getting painfully chewed on all over.

530
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,820
So, you shouldn't think of finding a boy here and marrying him.

531
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,240
You should study. Study hard to become a career woman.

532
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,070
It's cool. "Gold Miss." Okay?

533
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,630
What did you say?

534
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,040
I know you're unhappy. I know. I know.

535
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,850
But, you'll understand what I'm saying when you're older.

536
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:06,030
Anyway. Study hard. You can do it!

537
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,270
Well, I'm done here.

538
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,990
Just in case you might misinterpret what I'm saying...

539
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:23,850
I am not interested in you at all. I'm giving you a brush off!

540
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,870
What is this?

541
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,980
I...wow.

542
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,530
I'm a hero. How many lives have I saved?

543
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:51,780
You said you wanted to study. You could be a doctor or prosecutor. Live a life full of variety.

544
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,220
I lived with you because I was me. If it was anyone else, you would've been kicked out.

545
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,600
You don't even know anything.

546
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,740
Min Seo Young?

547
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,330
Do you remember my first love, Min Seo Young, in the past?

548
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:29,040
I should have seduced her then. I was too shy though.

549
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,110
Even if you did go back to the past, you can't seduce her.

550
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:36,700
If I do, I'll seduce her. Would I get Ma Jin Joo?

551
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,180
This crazy guy. Did he choose me just to say that?

552
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,510
Torturing my husband? Torturing?

553
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,870
He's saying whatever he wants.

554
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,050
Where is he?

555
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,040
Does he think he came here by himself?

556
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,010
Excuse me..

557
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,070
You're Min Seo Young, right?

558
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,060
Huh?

559
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:50,340
Is he...

560
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,310
Oh, sorry. Hi.

561
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:59,870
Do you know me?

562
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,360
Maybe you...

563
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,020
don't?

564
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,870
I don't really know you, but I don't not know you.

565
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,110
Then that means you know me.

566
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,340
What?

567
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:21,170
♫  It's like I'm dreaming. ♫

568
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:29,180
♫  If I could turn back time. ♫

569
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:37,040
♫ When I dream of you... The days where my heart hurts. ♫

570
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:44,800
♫ When I dream of you, you and I who lost our way. ♫

571
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,270
♫  The warm you, the shining us.  ♫

572
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,480
Wow, Ban Do's amazing.

573
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,460
He went for his first love.

574
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,860
How did he live when he missed Seo Young so much?

575
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,780
♫  I'm praying for... ♫

576
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:11,280
So, this day gave me a miracle to show me this?

577
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,470
Ma Jin Joo, you lived the wrong way all along.

578
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:22,070
It's good, then. I got my closure after my divorce.

579
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,050
Seo Jin.

580
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,550
Seo Jin!

581
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,270
Seo Jin.

582
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,040
Seo Jin.

583
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,830
It's dangerous. Come here.

584
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,270
That mean bastard.

585
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,680
Please go to Seongbuk-dong, Building Number 31.

586
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:01,230
♬The golden days ... Sad on the long journey I'm barefoot and young♬

587
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:07,620
♬ But I'm not stopping there. I'm going and coming Da Da Da Da ♬

588
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:13,150
♬ Stay with me. Watch me.♬

589
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:20,160
♬ Someday I'll bing the whole world in front of you. ♬

590
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,270
We're here.

591
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,330
Okay...

592
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,590
Arms down.
Dismissed.

593
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,130
Chairman, we are here.

594
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,760
Don't you know what's embarrassing?

595
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,860
You should leave.

596
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,470
We are not in a relationship to have a talk here.

597
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,930
This is different from what you told me.

598
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,770
I told you to be a part of the student council, but you participated in the ROTC for no reason.

599
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,820
Why? You should just start doing whatever I say not to do.

600
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,550
Why don't you go study History while you are at it?

601
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,650
You should even date, which I've forbidden.<

602
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,040
That's a good idea.

603
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,390
It's Nam Gil!

604
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,650
He's so handsome!

605
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:05,160
You.

606
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,280
Will you date me?

607
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,830
What is this?

608
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:17,990
I don't want to.

609
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,220
She's crazy.

610
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,920
- Is she out of her mind.
- What is wrong with her?

611
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,600
Why would she reject him?

612
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,840
Why?

613
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,020
You smell like sweat.

614
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,990
My god.

615
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,780
He's so foolish.

616
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,640
What is she?

617
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:19,050
In movies, people use time machines to time travel.

618
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:24,050
If not that, they time travel when they wake up from sleeping.

619
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,980
You're not sleeping?

620
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,490
Yeah. I'm not.

621
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,550
"To my dear mom."

622
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,580
Divorce, time slip, dream?

623
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:03,560
What is this?

624
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Look at him...

625
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,590
He is my favorite.

626
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,800
Me too, me too.

627
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,830
What?

628
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,710
What? What? What!

629
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:20,030
watch TV or sleep!

630
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:23,270
You're putting a lot of pressure on me!

631
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,480
Did I feed her something wrong?

632
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,930
What's wrong with her?

633
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,260
Maybe she's going through puberty late.

634
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,420
Late? Do you not remember?

635
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,740
She put us through so much when it happened during junior high.

636
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,030
She would not be human if she does it again.

637
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,530
That's right. I wonder what is wrong with her.

638
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:06,240
I will be leaving, Mom.

639
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:11,890
Mom. Mom.

640
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,670
She is scaring me.

641
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,170
Me too.

642
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,710
Yes.

643
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:42,240
I can't sleep.

644
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,540
Not sleeping.

645
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,360
What is this?

646
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,830
Why do I look like this?

647
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,830
Yes. Yes.

648
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,390
I'm here.

649
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,670
What happened in 1999.

650
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,270
The real 1999.

651
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,320
[ Epilogue ]
♬ I will meet the people who have left me.

652
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:56,060
Hey. Why do they have seagulls on their eyebrows?

653
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,430
And, why do they all have bruises on their lips?

654
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:04,390
Are you the one who planted the dynamite?

655
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,400
she looks like she is going to explode.

656
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,230
There are only two left. Ban Do, it is your turn.

657
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:15,200
You have to take care of the bomb.

658
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,140
It's your turn.

659
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,530
Make sure-

660
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:26,450
♫ All I know is how to live ♫

661
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,010
Let's take a picture.

662
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,590
Who knows, someone may end up getting married.

663
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,150
♫ We realized ♫

664
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,280
What the?

665
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,430
♫ that you can't avoid it ♫

666
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:47,930
♫ Now when the answer is love  ♫

667
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:55,030
♫ I will love everything in this world ♫

668
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,850
Go Back Couple, Preview.

669
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,760
Give me all this family's money.

670
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,830
I think he's up to something.

671
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,970
You almost had me fooled.

672
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,560
Your acting's as good as Jeon Do Yeon.

673
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,400
Since this is my situation right now, I'm going to enjoy it.

674
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,070
Can you give me your number?

675
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,930
I told you not to flirt with me.

676
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,790
I'm sorry!

677
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,970
I never thought I'd come to a club with you!

678
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:25,550
- What's the matter?
- If I don't go now, when will I ever?

679
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,590
It's the guy who fell for me!

680
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,450
Director Park?
