1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,660
Hello?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,420
- Where are you?
- What?

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,940
I'm crying right now. Am I going to cry by myself again?

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,080
Don't cry. I'll go.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,760
I'll go, so stay where you are.

6
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,620
- Eun Joo!
- Ma Jin Joo!

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,810
What do I do? Ban Do!

8
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,640
Choi Ban Do! Honey!

9
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,650
No, no!

10
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,630
No, get up! Ban Do!

11
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,670
No! Get up!

12
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,870
Honey!

13
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,030
Honey!

14
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,010
Get up!

15
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,110
The Center Operating Room

16
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,870
Ban Do.

17
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,880
Ban Do. What do I do?

18
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,210
What are you doing?

19
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,310
Oh! Wow, it came back to life.

20
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,930
It did, but.

21
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,570
Maybe I watered too much. It's not looking good.

22
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,310
We have to regularly water it. If we water it all at once, the plant will feel pressured.

23
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,750
Leave it and come out, Honey. You said you felt pins and needles in your hands and feet. I'll massage them.

24
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,950
After I clean up the rest.

25
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,030
Call his parents, please. We have to go into surgery quickly.

26
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm his family. I'll sign it. Please do it quickly.

27
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,650
Friends can't sign it. We have to know whether he's taking any medication right now and his blood type.

28
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,680
I know it all. His blood type is A.

29
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,810
He has slight asthma and allergy. He's allergic to peaches.

30
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,880
It's really me... Please do it quickly. What do I do if it all goes badly?

31
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,030
Ban Do! Where is he? Is it here?

32
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,970
Mother.

33
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
Hey. Did you shave sloppily again?

34
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,250
Oh, you and your impatience.

35
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,540
Visits aren't allowed for patient Choi Ban Do.

36
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,750
But, the surgery went well and he's recovering. Why aren't visits allowed?

37
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,080
That's true, but. With the exception of his family, visits aren't allowed.

38
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,360
- Can I do it today?
- No, not yet.

39
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,940
- Is he really okay?
- He's recovering.

40
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,030
Why do you keep saying he's recovering? If visits aren't allowed, that means he's not well.

41
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,130
Mother.

42
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,620
- Are you his girlfriend?
- Pardon?

43
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,280
Yes.

44
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,330
I'm Ma Jin Joo.

45
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,590
Your name's pretty, too. I couldn't talk to you that day because everything was so hectic.

46
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,460
You like Ban Do a lot, right?

47
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,390
You cried more than me. I was so surprised.

48
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,090
Ban Do's awake now. He's okay.

49
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,860
The hospital said visits aren't allowed. Don't worry about it. You should go home.

50
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,930
When visits are allowed, I'll contact you. Get home safely, okay?

51
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,940
Mother.

52
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,720
Is he really okay?

53
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,650
Due to our Jin Joo's pretty heart,

54
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,570
Ban Do's surgery went well and his recovery is going fast.

55
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,060
Don't worry about it.

56
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,250
Yes, mother. Goodbye!

57
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,730
What was it about?

58
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,930
She says not to come over to early on the Chinese New Year. She says Father will nag about us having a baby.

59
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,940
Dad, really..

60
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,220
Don't worry about it too much.

61
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:11,570
I don't anymore. But, you know, I love it when Mother says "our Jin Joo."
- "Our Jin Joo?"

62
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,970
Other households say "daughter-in-law" or "baby." She says "our Jin Joo."

63
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,780
It might be so I won't feel alienated from your family.

64
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,450
Anyway, I like it.

65
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,710
Mother, don't worry about it, too.

66
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,150
Thank you.

67
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,670
She's gone.

68
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,160
But, why do keep turning away a girl who's just worried about you?

69
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,620
You rescued her risking your own life.

70
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,900
She's really nice and pretty.

71
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,030
Yeah, she's pretty.

72
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,990
- Mom.
- Yeah?

73
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,950
Even if you don't remember, remember this. She was really good to you.

74
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,030
You keep talking nonsense. Seriously.

75
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,760
Rest up more.

76
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,370
Choi Ban Do.

77
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,830
Ma Jin Joo.

78
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,010
- Did you meet him yet?
- No, since visits aren't allowed.

79
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,690
What? Why not? I'm here because Ban Do told me to come.

80
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,030
Let's have a divorce. We're too unhappy. I'm too unhappy!

81
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,940
Mom, being in your arms is the best.

82
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,370
Oh, you're here?

83
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,790
Hey, Choi Ban Do.

84
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,090
What's this?

85
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,470
Why'd you do that?

86
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,700
I really thought you were going to die that day.

87
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,810
My world become white and I couldn't breathe.

88
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:32,450
In that short moment, I was so, so scared.

89
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,350
I felt like every cell in my body was standing up.

90
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,950
Like that time with my mom.

91
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,630
I couldn't do anything.

92
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,090
They said I'm not your family. That you and I are strangers.

93
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,500
I couldn't let you get a surgery.

94
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,610
Even though my husband of eighteen years was dying,

95
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,690
Mere surgery...

96
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,680
Why'd you do it?

97
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,240
Why are you avoiding me?

98
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,490
Sorry.

99
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,550
I'm sorry.

100
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,010
Why are you being like this to me?

101
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,890
I saw it when I was close to death.

102
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,710
What my greed as a human was doing to someone.

103
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,380
You said it

104
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,330
to Director Park's wife. You said, "There are more days to live than days you've lived already."

105
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,180
We don't even know how to go back.

106
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,350
Jin Joo.

107
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,030
Let's forget it all.

108
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,900
Just live here with your mom.

109
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,910
What?

110
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,710
I thought my sincerity would be enough. But it wasn't.

111
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,880
I can't find the confidence within me to not make you cry.

112
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,670
Then, what about Seo Jin? What about our Seo Jin?

113
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:40,290
Did you just let go of our Seo Jin?

114
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,160
Is that it?

115
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,300
To me, rather than our son who's filled my mind,

116
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,770
you, who is like my heart, are more precious.

140
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,270
Jin Joo. Wake up.

141
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,040
Someone's outside.

142
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,390
Who?

143
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,420
A boy.

144
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,000
What's this? You didn't contact me.

145
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,510
Huh? Oh, if I contacted you to say I wanted to have fun and hang out, you'd tell me not to come.

146
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,550
- I'm not feeling well today.
- Today's my birthday.

147
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,420
Let's have fun today.

148
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,680
It's him, the son of the Executive Director. He seems well off, huh?

149
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,130
I'm not doing it!

150
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,270
Bo Reum, let's go together!

151
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,390
Cheon Seol, come slowly. You're going to fall.

152
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,810
I won't fall. Do you have practice today? The national convention's soon, right?

153
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,920
- You're the center again, right?
- Don't know about that. I'll have to go through the preliminary.

154
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,910
Oh, you and your modesty. If you aren't going to do it, who will?

155
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,990
It'd be nice if Jae Woo did better so you guys could be partners.

156
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,630
That's not something that can happen overnight. It's okay.

157
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,790
Let's go.

158
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,120
National Competition Preliminary

159
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,690
♫ I can feel you breathing ♫

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,270
♫ Until the end of my days ♫

161
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,610
Okay, you can stop.

162
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,760
It was good. You did great. I don't think you can get the center spot, but you'll be in the ensemble.

163
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,040
Ah, okay, I see.

164
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,130
Of course, there's no one else but you who can do it.

165
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,080
- Next.
- Yes.

166
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,970
What's this? Are you going to the national convention, too?

167
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,370
Well, wouldn't it okay for me to enter the preliminary?

168
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,300
Okay, then you can try.

169
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:04,210
Hey, why don't you bring up my Jae Woo? What if he makes it? Huh?

170
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,990
Don't judge a book by its cover.

171
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,540
Oh, gosh.

172
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,460
Okay, stop.

173
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,990
Oh, Ahn Jae Woo... You really improved a lot. Seriously.

174
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,400
Thank you.

175
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,140
You did well. I don't think you can quite be in the center yet, but you'll be in the ensemble.

176
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,740
The ensemble. I can't. I have to be in the center.

177
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,500
- What?
- No, it's nothing.

178
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,000
Where are we going? What's that?

179
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,590
- A picnic.
- Picnic?

180
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,500
Yeah. On birthdays, the person gets to choose what they want to do.

181
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,890
Well, yeah, that's true, but.

182
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,330
Here is the list for the national competition.
[ Center: Moon Ye Won, Meyong No Yeong
Ensemble: Bae Se Yeong, Lee Gyeong Taek,

183
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,700
Song Hye Gyo, Song Joong Ki, Yoon Bo Reum, Ahn Jae Woo, Son Min Jeong, Seo Yeong Min

184
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,400
Yoon Bo Reum. Why'd you do that?

185
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,720
You did it on purpose, right? How could you be in the ensemble?

186
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,530
Hey, Ahn Jae Woo! What's wrong?

187
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,750
You made a mistake on purpose, right? It's because I'm not that good. Why did you have to be bad along with me? Why did you do that making me feel weird?

188
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,980
What's so weird about it? Is wanting to be partners with your boyfriend weird?

189
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,200
But still, you have to know how to separate work and personal issues. I'm becoming an obstacle for your future right now.

190
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,590
This isn't a matter of life and death. What obstacle?

191
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,280
- This is my method of going towards you.
- What?

192
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,540
I want to be your partner more than being in the center. You put the effort in too.

193
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,450
Trying to come toward me. The process is what's important, not the result.

194
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,790
If you tried to come to me, but couldn't, I can go toward you. What is the problem there?

195
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,810
The feeling wanting to get close is what's important.

196
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,970
You fool. I have to say it for you to understand.

197
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,870
Tada!

198
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,000
You're hungry, right? Let's eat this.

199
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,040
You really prepared this yourself?

200
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,840
Of course. I prepared this from early in the morning.

201
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,690
Oh, my. It didn't seem like that. I guess you can cook.

202
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,450
Look at how you rolled them up so well. You're very tidy.

203
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,130
Let's look at this.

204
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,220
Tteokbokki.

205
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,090
You're saying you prepared Korean sausage all by yourself?

206
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:55,720
I could believe the  gimbap,  but  tteokbokki  and sundae? You bought these.

207
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,840
Yeah. I said I prepared it, I never said I made it.

208
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,980
- Ah, okay.
- I did put them in, though.

209
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,470
♬  I'm falling in love with you.  ♬

210
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,470
You can pop some of them. As if they were homemade.
♫ My reflection in your beautiful eyes ♫

211
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,180
Gosh, I got it. I'm rolling them up loosely on purpose.

212
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:30,370
You should've just packed them up. Why put them all in nice dishes? You were going to confess to me anyway.

213
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,470
I didn't put them in the dishes to lie about me preparing the food.

214
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,380
I wanted to make it seem more like a picnic. Like a mom's packed lunch.

215
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,080
Besides the times when I was younger, there wasn't a time when I packed lunch like this.

216
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,530
♬  I'll approach slowly.  ♬

217
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,980
It's good. Have this.

218
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,720
♬  I'll knock quietly.  ♬

219
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,040
Yum.
♬  Let me in your mind. ♬

220
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,460
It's good.

221
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,230
Who's there?

222
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,460
- Tada!
- Tada!

223
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,550
What's this?

224
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,750
You guys came, too?

225
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,300
Well, I didn't feel like sitting in class. So, I brought them all with me.

226
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,800
Aigoo.

227
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,030
Are you okay? We're approaching the end of the semester.

228
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,720
What's with a car accident?

229
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,470
I'm not okay. It hurts so much.

230
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,240
I heard you had an operation.

231
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,570
When you're bored, read this.

232
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,320
What's this?

233
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,380
Oh, this?

234
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,400
It's not for you,

235
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,420
but for us.

236
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,100
What is it?

237
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,330
Wow, you guys are definitely something.

238
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,940
How could you think of buying this while you were coming to a hospital?

239
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,390
Even though you're in your youth, you guys lack common sense.

240
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,230
Hey. Then, you, with your common sense, are eating this stuff? You're a patient.

241
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,940
When liquor is in front of you, not drinking it isn't good manners in terms of drinking.

242
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,720
It's your fault for buying it.

243
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,400
To celebrate that, cheers!

244
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,650
Cheers!

245
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,620
We couldn't have not bought it because of him.

246
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,990
Stop crying, a**hole! You're an ugly sight, man!

247
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,590
As a man, you should learn to give up your life for your country.

248
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,200
Geez, what a sight.

249
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,410
Hey, you.

250
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,140
What? Why?

251
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,730
What do you mean, go to the military? I'm the only son in our family for the third generation in a row.

252
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,890
What has this country done for me?

253
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,100
Bo Reum!

254
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,430
No, it's whatever.

255
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,820
It's fine! Two years will pass by quickly.

256
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,880
Yeah! Even if we're juniors, we'll still hang out with you.

257
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,500
Just leave him.

258
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,240
No matter how you comfort him, he can't hear you.

259
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,800
That is a time he needs to learn to bear alone.

260
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,840
So called, Military Prep.

261
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,860
- Not reserve?
- What's that?

262
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,140
It's what describes the time between the moment you receive your notice to the moment you enter the military.

263
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,100
Step one. Denial.

264
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,580
Denial?

265
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,500
No, no. This isn't it.

266
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,120
Even if my birthday is early in the year, why would I get an draft notice already?

267
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,090
There's something seriously wrong here.

268
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,990
Step two. Anger.

269
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,830
Why is it me?

270
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,350
Why me?

271
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,570
He didn't get his draft notice, and he didn't, either. Why is it me first?

272
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,450
Oh...

273
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,820
Step three. Compromise.

274
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,040
Step four. Depression.

275
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,560
Ban Do.

276
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,580
- Use this to help with your hospital bills. How can a soldier have a gold necklace?
- Thanks.

277
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,370
Cheon Seol. This isn't beef jerky.

278
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,890
Bo Reum, use this to tie your hair. It's a limited edition.

279
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,870
I'll talk with you separately.

280
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,920
Last step. Acceptance. Acknowledgement.

281
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,850
Hey, what's that? What's he doing?

282
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,810
He's memorizing your phone numbers.

283
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,990
What? Hey! You better not give me a call.

284
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,940
I'll reject your call!

285
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,620
Don't pity me.

286
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,660
You got hurt while saving Jin Joo.

287
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,690
It could've ended really badly, right?

288
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,040
What do you mean bad?

289
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,030
Could've been bad. No one would deny Choi Ban Do's stubborn love. He's totally putting his life on the line.

290
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,230
What? What love?

291
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,870
The love between you and Ma Jin Joo.

292
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,870
Oh, did you not know?

293
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,120
That you and Ma Jin Joo like each other?

294
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,430
Did you guys not know, either?

295
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,280
We know.

296
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,680
We'd be idiots if we didn't know that.

297
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,110
Let's go.

298
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,340
Hey...

299
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,510
Thank you for that day.

300
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,170
The day of the accident. You called 911 and stuff...

301
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,540
I didn't do it for you to thank me. Why are you thankful?

302
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,550
He should be thankful.

303
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,130
Well, he's closer to me.

304
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,020
In the past, even though I saved you,

305
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,600
- Choi Ban Do thanked me.
- Pardon?

306
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,100
When you should be thankful, he's thankful.

307
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,560
When he should be thankful, you're thankful.

308
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,720
Why are you two so empathetic for one another?

309
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,100
There's no room for me to squeeze in.

310
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,160
- Hey.
- Let's go.

311
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,510
There's somewhere else I wanted to go.

312
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,510
Madam, why did you want to come to the street market instead of the mall?

313
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,290
They say the market has fresh ingredients, so I decided to come.

314
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,500
Oh, I see.

315
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,600
Give me some small anchovies here.

316
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,370
You bought quite a lot last time. You ate all of it so fast.

317
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,510
The kids don't eat breakfast.

318
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,050
I fried up some anchovies and made some rice balls. And they liked them.

319
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,130
Oh, really? I should do that for my kids, too.

320
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,960
- They make a huge deal over not eating breakfast.
- Tell me about it.

321
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,350
- Give me some more!
- Aigoo!

322
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,990
Here.

323
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,530
It's really small now.

324
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,450
This playground.

325
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,350
It's nothing great.

326
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,350
Of course a playground isn't anything great.

327
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,660
Do you think a ghost is going to appear somewhere?

328
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,560
I used to be the most afraid of this place.

329
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,020
The playground?

330
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,030
Yeah.

331
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,840
When I played here as a young boy,

332
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,920
every kid would be called by their mom and they'd leave.

333
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,320
I was always left alone in an empty playground.

334
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,970
The fact that my friends would leave me was scary.

335
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,650
The fact that there would be no one coming even after I waited was scary, too.

336
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,430
So, I didn't come here.

337
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,310
I didn't have high expectations.

338
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,000
I just wanted to be normal like the others.

339
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,610
Mom.

340
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,000
I just wanted that one thing.

341
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,350
She wasn't given to me.

342
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:16,820
Just because other people all do it, or is ordinary... It doesn't mean it's an easy thing.

343
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,330
Living as a mom,

344
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:27,810
it might seem like a common act that everyone knows. But, in actuality, it's a huge deal.

345
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:34,860
It seems like your past, present, and future all disappear.

346
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:44,750
Makes you feel as if your existence on this earth means nothing and you're worthless.

347
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,550
Oh, it's so hot.

348
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,290
The fear and pressure that you have to be the most strong person in the world...

349
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,540
That's not an easy thing.

350
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,120
It's a huge deal.

351
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,820
It's not that your mom didn't do it, but she couldn't do it.

352
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,160
She's human, too.

353
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,610
I can never figure you out.

354
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,910
When I'm with you, I feel comfortable.

355
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,360
I feel as if I'm also a kind person with you.

356
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,990
Now that I really like you...

357
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,450
I finally realize where you're looking at.

358
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,290
No, no!

359
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,220
Honey!

360
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,410
Honey!

361
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:18,280
Get up!

362
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:25,840
It feels so unfair. So I'm going to have to say this now.

363
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,630
I really like you a lot.

364
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,880
I just wanted you to know.

365
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,050
She doesn't even know how pretty she is.

366
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,160
Thank you for liking me.

367
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,060
Thanks for letting me know that I'm still a girl.

368
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,540
But, you really don't know

369
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,920
how warm a person you are.

370
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,090
- What?
- You just don't know the method.

371
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,500
A cat that cries alone, lonely people...

372
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,870
You're someone who can look into other people's pain, Sunbae.

373
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,790
You're not rough around the edges...

374
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,110
and you're not crooked.

375
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,510
You grew up well.

376
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,180
- Today wasn't your birthday, right?
- What?

377
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,160
I saw your ID when you dropped your wallet earlier.

378
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,060
So, am I really your first love?

379
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,320
Do you like it?

380
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,530
Well, a bit.

381
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,390
It's nice to know that you're someone's first love.

382
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:28,990
Happiness when you realize that there's someone unexpected cheering you on from behind the scene.

383
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,700
It's nice.

384
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,810
You were like that to me before, Sunbae...

385
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,250
It's like that now, too.

386
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,700
I'm sorry and thankful.

387
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,050
I'll take you home.

388
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,580
No, it's fine.

389
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,370
I think it will be best if we part here.

390
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:55,690
I don't want to leave you by yourself here.

391
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,300
So, you can leave first.

392
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,580
Okay.

393
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,660
I'll be going.

394
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,430
- Jin Joo.
- Yeah, Mom?

395
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,580
Where did you go? Was it a nice place?

396
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,090
Well, we went to Han River and other places.

397
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,670
Jin Joo.

398
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah?

399
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,580
Do you want to drink with me?

400
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,020
Huh?

401
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,900
- This is nice.
- You know how to drink, Mom? It's my first time seeing you like this.

402
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,440
Of course!

403
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,420
I used to be a better drinker than most men in our neighborhood in the past.

404
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,380
That's amazing.

405
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,520
It turns out that you're good at dancing, singing,

406
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,450
and drinking.

407
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,530
As for knowing how to have fun drinking, I was born with it.

408
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,750
Pretty.

409
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,050
Mom, you're so pretty.

410
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,450
- Me?
- Yeah.

411
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,090
I really wanted to tell you this.

412
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,830
My daughter's pretty, too. Really pretty.

413
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,560
Of course! You're the one who gave birth to me.

Jin Joo.

426
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600
- My pretty daughter.
- Yeah?

427

Pretty Mom's daughter.

428
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:05,910
You should go to your baby now.

429
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,120
Mom.

430
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,040
Leave it and come out, Honey. You said you felt pins and needles in your hands and feet. I'll massage them.

431
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,720
- After I clean up the rest.
- Okay.

432
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,670
She's strange.

433
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,470
It'll be your birthday soon, so she's probably going to give it to you then.

434
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,210
To Mom, whom I love.

Mom? You haven't even been in my dreams once.

Mom.

It all happens when you raise your own child.

475

It will happen.

I felt uncomfortable, so I'm going to take a walk around here.

484
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,910
Don't go too far.

485
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,410
Are we going home now?

Yes.

505
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,870
Your father is going to resign.

506
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,710
You won't need to worry anymore.

507

Oh, Ok.

508

Is it ok to go out without breakfast?

Yes, it's fine.

I think Bo Reum is a little bit too good for him, but I hope they don't break up.

532
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,920
Right, right?

533

551
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:20,780

552
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,740
JIn Joo, you too.

553
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,720
Honey. Mine?

554
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,530
Just eat, I will make it again for you.

555
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,140
Go ahead.

556
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,690
Yes, thank you for the meal.

557
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,890
Let's eat.

558
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,540
Jin Joo.
Hmm?

559
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:05,920
If I am not at the place that you will return to...

560
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,760
Yes?

561
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,310
If it is like that, please take care of your dad.

562
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:17,480
What?

563
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,590
How will you dad manage without me?

564
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,880
Go visit him sometimes, have some drinks with him.

565
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,750
Take Seo Jin to see him. Can you do that?

566
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:07,930
Father! I brought you some skate, your favorite.

567
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:15,360
Why did you do that? I know you have no intentions of remarrying.

568
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:21,070
Jin Joo's mom told me not to live a lonely life.

569
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,480
So I said it.

570
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,180
Take care of your dad.

571
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,560
There...is something I am curious about.

572
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,720
Can I ask?

573
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,820
Go ahead, what is it?

574
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,610
Why did Yoon Bo Reum and Ahn Jae Woo break up?
What?

575
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:25,420
Is that all you can ask at such a moment.

576
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:31,320
I mean since I came here and saw how in love they are I got very curious.

577
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,940
What is it?

578
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:38,430
Bo Reum is infertile. She can't have babies.

579
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,440
Wait, she could have just said so.

580
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,550
Ahn Jae Woo is a third generation chaebol. How can she do that to him?

581
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:00,620
She just let him go, so he can meet someone else.

582
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,640
Is that why you comforted her a lot.

583
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,160
I understand.

584
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:10,750
We had such a hard time getting our own son.

585
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,630
That is right.

586
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,980
Shall we go? See our Seo Jin?

587
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:42,330
♬  When I first met you, we were a bit awkward.  ♬

588
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,940
♬  A bit awkward.  ♬

Seo JIn. Seo Jin!

599
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:39,880
Seo Jin! My son, I am here!

600
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,610
Mom is here.

601
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,760
Mom came.

602
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,600
Seo Jin.

603
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,620
Seo Jin.

604
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,660
Mom, Mom!

605
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,430
Come here.

606
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,550
Choi Ban Do said this

607
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:24,270
We may have just been gone on a trip.

608
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,720
And all trips are for the purpose of returning.

609
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:32,330
You go on a trip to love what you already have.

610
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,200
How much is your income?

611
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,070
My income must be super important.

612
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,450
Of course, we aren't dating over here, we are talking about marriage.

613
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,220
You must make a lot of money then.

614
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:48,270
I want to be a housewife.

615
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,940
Housewife...

616
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,150
The appearance is the lifeline for an attorney.

617
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,180
So, I use a facial mask once per day.

618
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,730
You must not care for your looks much.

619
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,910
I can see you have a lot of wrinkles on your neck.

620
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,880
Crazy bastard.

621
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,620
Is that a challenge?

622
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,130
You look like a piece of gum someone spit out. What? The wrinkles on my neck?

623
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:17,370
I have nothing to say to you. Seriously?

624
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:19,540
Gosh, I'm so pissed.

625
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,930
What is this?

626
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,520
The best of soup and rice, Seoul style beef broth restaurant

627
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,250
Let's go inside.

628
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,210
Let's go in.

629
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:43,490
Our baby is so pretty. Peek-a-boo!

630
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:48,210
My baby is so pretty. Did you look for Mommy?

631
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,570
This?

632
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,730
Put him down, Dad, he's heavy.

633
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,550
Give him to me, he's heavy for you.

634
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,720
It's ok, I want to carry him.

635
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,460
I got through a week just to see Seo Jin.

636
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,800
Isn't that right, Seo Jin?

637
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:07,190
But your parents aren't here yet?

638
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,020
That's right.

639
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,730
Seriously? The two are meeting again?

640
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,120
They want to get married. Yoon Bo Reum and Ahn Jae Woo.

641
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,560
Wow! Daebak! They must be fated to meet again.

642
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,320
What about kids?

643
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:27,600
They won't have kids, they want to travel around.

644
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,660
That is cool.

645
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,850
That's that. But we went through all that going back in time and came back. How come we're still the same?

646
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,220
Nothing has changed.

647
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,100
That's right.

648
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,440
When are your parents getting here?

649
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,670
They will get here eventually.

650
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:48,160
- That's a nice car.
- It's an expensive one.

651
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,250
What?

652
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,470
Mr. Kim, stay put.

653
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,550
Yes, Elder.

654
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,550
Mom.

655
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,450
Why are you looking at us like that?

656
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,710
What is up with your clothes? And this car?

657
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:18,270
Why? What is wrong with our clothes?

658
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:21,420
Isn't this all expensive? You have money to waste?

659
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,650
This kid, Yes! I have money to waste.

660
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,580
Are you acting like that because we got rich by listening to you?

661
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,700
What? Is it...Pangyo?

662
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,770
What is wrong with you? You told us to invest.

663
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,230
It worked.

664
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,160
Dad! So we are rich?

665
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,680
But why do we live in that apartment?

666
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:58,030
This kid, if I am rich, are you rich?

667
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:00,750
Where are you sitting? Let's go inside.

668
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,310
Oh, what should I do? I forgot the kimchi I said I'd give to the kids.

669
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,930
Why am I so forgetful? Is this a sign of dementia?

670
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:17,490
What dementia? We're not even in our seventies. We're in our prime, Honey!

671
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,980
But still, if I get dementia, send me away to a home, Honey.

672
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,790
What home? Forget it.

673
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:32,070
You have me. I will carry you around.

674
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,680
Let's go.

675
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,070
Let's go together, Honey.

676
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,130
Oh!

677
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,910
You are smiling because you like Grandpa.

678
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:00,870
No, he was smiling at me.

679
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,000
Isn't that right?

680
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,490
No, we just made eye contact and he smiled.

681
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:18,390
He was smiling at me. Mineral spring!

682
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:24,020
Right, Seo Jin? You always smiled at me, right?

683
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:30,060
Honey, Honey. Let's move. Let's move closer to them.

684
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,630
What are you saying, Honey?

685
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,540
Mineral spring?

686
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:44,920
Yeah, Honey, I have a conference today so I can't come home.

687
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:49,040
What do I do? I have a date with my wife right now.

688
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,390
Even though you guys have been married for a while you still love her so much?

689
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:57,920
Of course. Her face and her heart. I love everything about her.

690
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,700
Yes.

691
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,490
Oppa!

692
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,390
Honey!

693
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:15,550
My wife is here. I'm hanging up.

694
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,110
Did you wait long?

695
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,090
No. Did you eat?

696
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,820
No, not yet.

697
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,660
You weren't cold?

698
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,830
No I am ok.

699
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,550
What do you want to eat?

700
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,120
Well...

701
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:31,900
Anything.

702
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,410
Anything? How about meat.

703
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,220
Deal!

704
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,490
Oppa what are you doing?

705
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,830
Kiss kiss.

706
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:41,310
Do you know them?

707
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,340
What?

708
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:56,270
Travel to the outside of the world

709
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:06,200
Hi. Seol? Where are you?

710
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,590
I am in Madagascar. Did you get my book?

711
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,840
Yes, you are amazing, our Cheon.

712
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,760
Then it is all good. I will call you when I get back to Korea.

713
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,650
Ok.

714
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,080
Who was that? Was that Cheon Seol?

715
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:33,600
Yes, she said she is in Mada...well anyhow, where ever that is, she is there.

716
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,360
That's amazing. She was the most fragile girl, but now she's totally a strong woman. Totally.

717
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,160
I know. Aren't you proud?

718
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,010
Hello.

719
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:48,780
Yes?

720
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,600
This is the courthouse. Your document on your divorce...

721
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,490
If you don't submit it within three months, it will be dropped.

722
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,220
- Okay.
- Yes.

723
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:13,650
Il Won...

724
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:15,940
- Show me.
- Yeah.

725
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,080
It's dangerous if you go by yourself.

Someone who will stand by you firmly. Forever on my side.

731

Episode 12, My beloved comrade

734
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,810
Heavenly System 50 years ago

735
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:19,020
Two strangers meet and live out a life together. How could there be only good times?

736
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,930
It's not like we're gods who know everything.

737
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,690
What did you say, woman?

738
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,430
I called you a tightwad, you tightwad!

739
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:36,090
How rude! How dare you speak so rudely in front of me?

740
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:38,450
I'm a god. What's wrong with you?

741
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:43,450
I'm with my husband. Why? I'm a god, too. You're not the only one.

742
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:47,900
You begged me to marry you, so I married you. And now you forget our anniversary?

743
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,330
You forgot on purpose, right? Because you didn't want to spend the money, you tightwad.

744
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:54,150
How dare this woman keeps calling me a tightwad?

745
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:57,860
Do you know how unhappy my life has gotten because I met you?

746
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,080
My life got all tangled up ever since I met you, too.

747
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,020
Let's get a divorce!
