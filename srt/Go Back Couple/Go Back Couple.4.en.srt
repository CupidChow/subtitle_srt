1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,230
Winter of 1998, Choi Ban Do's 19th Year.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm not really into civil engingeering

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,600
Ha, are you trying to choose from a menu?

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,640
After you did poorly on your college entrance exams,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,810
you think you get a choice in what you major in?

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,250
Registration is now closed!

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,620
We're closing the doors now!

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,950
Please wait!

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,090
Wait, hold on!

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,290
Thank you!

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,000
There's a giant thing called the heart that's present during youth.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,580
Without rhyme or reason, embarrassingly, It's always going ba dump, ba dump!

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,450
Because of it, we all turn into fools.

14
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,060
You can do it. Be confident. Decisively.

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,090
Oh, I... I fell!

16
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,840
You -You c-can drink that.

17
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,890
Why did I do that? Why, why, why?

18
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,910
Hold on a second!

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,780
Thank you for the drink.

20
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,350
You made a great decision, Doc.

21
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,510
But, for the first time, when I became an adult who could control my heart..

22
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,690
This heart of mine seemed to harden and stop beating...

23
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,050
Was it even alive?

24
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,500
It was as if it just disappeared, without me knowing if it was still alive or not.

25
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:29,970
Episode 4: My Heart Beats Again

26
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,710
Seoul, 1999
Walk straight, I'm tired.

27
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,370
You shouldn't have drunk so much!

28
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,290
Did I drink because I wanted to?

29
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,480
I had an ulterior motive! Ugh, that heavy drinker.

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,670
What kind of girl competes by drinking?

31
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,230
Why? I thought it was cool.

32
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,990
Are we locked out?

33
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,830
If I miss another roll call, I'm dead.

34
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,620
This is all because of you!

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,280
This dumbo.

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,810
Look.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,180
You can just go in here.

38
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,040
What are you going to do?

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,870
Hey!
I'm going.

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,960
You got in!

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,770
I did, right? Okay, I'm going in farther.

42
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,820
Hey, I think this will work!

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,080
Wait, what's wrong with this?

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,010
Ow this hurts.

45
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,820
Hey, I'm going back out.

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,200
Okay, okay. Pull yourself out.

47
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,560
Ow, it hurts! Wait, I'm going out-

48
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,500
Wow, this is so embarrassing.

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,120
Hold on. I'll be right there!

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,510
Agh! Jae Woo!

51
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,660
What am I going to do?

52
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,910
Hey. Go Dok.

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,890
What?

54
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,360
How did you get in?

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
The door was open...

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,450
What?

57
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,050
- I'm going to do it.
- Do it.

58
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,010
Hey, bastard! You're doing this because it isn't your face!

59
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,400
It hurts!

60
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,470
Hey, you bastard!

61
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,640
Bastard, just because it's your face... put yourself in my place, man!

62
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,050
I can't do this.

63
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,950
You just go.

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,380
What?

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,330
I'm done for.

66
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,630
Just go. Or we're both going to die.

67
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,460
You have to survive. You have to make roll call.

68
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,930
- I can't.
- Make roll call first then,

69
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,450
you have to come back and save me.

70
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,640
No. No!

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,820
Just go! Quickly.

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,940
Just go!! Quickly!

73
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
Disappear, you bastard!

74
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,620
Go!

75
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,070
What is this?

76
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,550
Why is that bastard so fast?

77
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,530
Wait, wait!
Male Dormitory

78
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,910
I'm sorry, but at the school's gate, my friend's head is-

79
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,440
Class of '99 Movie Club

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,640
It's Yoon Bo Reum. Tomorrow, come to Room 201 in the Students' Building at 2 P.M.

81
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,120
Did she just ask me out on a date?

82
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,210
Jae Woo! Jae Woo.

83
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,160
Jae Woo, has roll call ended yet?

84
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,840
It's as if it's going to rain. No, it can't be!

85
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm Go Dok Jae!

86
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,920
An Jae Woo! It's raining!

87
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,990
Mister?

88
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,870
Is he hurt anywhere? Mister!

89
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,140
Mister! Oh!!

90
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,360
Water... give me water

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,160
- What the-
- Water...

92
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,700
Jae Woo...

93
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,580
Change your major to business management.

94
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
Don't be a history major. You can't earn any money.

95
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,510
If you want it, do it yourself.

96
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,540
You're doing it on purpose, right?

97
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,770
You are just doing this to rebel against me.

98
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,960
I don't care that much about you to be doing things I don't want to do, Chief Director.

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,760
Change your major to business management and learn how to run things, or go into the school office and learn the school system.

100
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,450
Choose one.

101
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,850
You mean learn about exploiting students.

102
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,670
What did you say?

103
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,040
Excuse me... Here.

104
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,930
I couldn't give you your birthday gift because you came home late yesterday.

105
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,380
Don't bother. You two should just live happily.

106
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,930
You should take this. Mother bought this for you.

107
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,670
That little punk.

108
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,660
He is too spoiled.

109
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,120
I should stop giving him allowance.

110
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,420
You better not do that!

111
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,750
Director, we demand an explanation!

112
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,960
We demand an explanation! ( For increasing food prices)

113
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,680
We demand an explanation.

114
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,140
-Yes?
-Why is it so hard to have a phone call with you?

115
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,250
- Why don't you pick up the phone?
- What's the matter?

116
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,560
Would I have any special reason to call you? Give me money.

117
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,070
- I don't have any money.
- Why, is your father not giving you any?

118
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,880
- I don't believe those people.
- Just stop.

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,040
Stop what? I gave birth to you, how come I don't get any money?

120
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,930
So, exactly how did you give birth?

121
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,940
Do you not know my birthday?

122
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,650
It's today. The day you gave birth to me.

123
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,860
If you need money, you can call him yourself.

124
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,310
Don't involve me in this!

125
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,290
Seongbuk-dong, Building 31, please.

126
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,550
What's up with her?

127
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,440
How'd you get stuck there?

128
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,610
How embarrassing. Is he an idiot?

129
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,460
Hey, hey. You can't even get yourself out.

130
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,570
Why did you put yourself there?

131
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,080
Kids are seriously weird these days.

132
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,750
Here we go.

133
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,400
Please do it carefully.

134
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,760
An electric saw! What are you doing with that thing?

135
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,460
Are you going to cut off my neck?

136
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,980
Why do we keep getting entangled?

137
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,520
Do you want to advertise that we got divorced?

138
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,370
Why don't you make a sign saying we left our kid to start over?

139
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,010
Things like this happen when people are drunk. You think I can't do it?

140
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,800
- It is a fact after all.
- There you go talking about facts.

141
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.

142
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,500
How are we the same?

143
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,310
You and I are both in the same boat if people find out.

144
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,070
How are we the same?

145
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,070
You are a married man yet you are all over your first love..

146
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,610
Does your first love know? That you're a married man and have a kid?

147
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,650
Why am I married? I got a divorce.

148
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,400
No one here knows that.

149
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,410
What about you? You have a kid yet you are going for a young guy?

150
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,160
You can't get yourself together.

151
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,680
That is more outrageous. You're an ahjumma..

152
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,920
What is going on? Did they both cheat on each other?</

153
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,450
They must be crazy.

154
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,890
Yesterday? That was an accident.

155
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,930
Don't even think about not paying me the alimony.

156
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to leave you penniless.

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,610
I'm a student.

158
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,280
I can't even afford gum. I'm a student. A broke student.

159
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,890
I can't give it to you. No, I won't give it.

160
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,910
Why should I hand over the money?

161
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,970
Wow, this is unbelievable.

162
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,210
There is a married student?

163
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,400
You stingy jerk.

164
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,540
Why? I thought you liked gum. The price of gum!

165
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,150
Yeah, that's right. You are so cheap. I don't know what I was thinking.

166
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,040
My stomach hurts, so bad.

167
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,120
Of course, it would hurt when you drank that much. Lady!

168
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,370
Only people who know how to party can do that.

169
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,140
You should't pretend to be something you aren't.

170
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,530
What?

171
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,080
That scared me.

172
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,240
- Hey! Ma Jin Joo!
- What?!

173
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,750
Don't contact that guy you met at the club yesterday. Don't get involved with him!

174
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,010
It seems as if you're just happy that a guy gave you his number,

175
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,720
but Doctor Park... He's just playing with you! Get it?

176
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
Oh, he's a doctor?

177
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,600
- What?
- In the future? He is a doctor, who works at a hospital?

178
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,610
Then, he had to be a man with taste, huh.

179
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,380
Then, I should take this chance to change my future. Thanks, Choi Ban Do.

180
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,780
Hey. Hey!

181
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,860
Just how much longer are we going to stay here?

182
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,970
- You left with the door open?
- I don't know!

183
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,790
He left his first wife that he had a child with and went to find his first love!

184
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,520
And, his first love doesn't even know he was a married man!

185
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,270
Hey, what is this? What's with the noise?

186
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,040
- A great thing was revealed.
- A great thing?

187
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
At our school, there's a student who was married.

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,610
What? Are you serious?

189
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,630
Hey, at what age did this student get married and get a divorce?

190
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,170
That's not important. Both of them are cheating on each other.

191
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,300
- Cheating?
- Well, no, since they already had a divorce.

192
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,370
But, they have a kid.

193
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,310
A kid? Wow. Kids these days are so scary.

194
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,370
Hey, he said he wouldn't give the alimony so he made a big deal.

195
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,120
Wow, that bastard! He's trash!

196
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,260
He's the kind of trash that you can't recycle or throw away.

197
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,180
He said he's a student and he can't earn a penny.

198
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,340
The girl was yelling, "Tightwad!"

199
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,480
A tightwad? Hey. Where'd you hear that from?

200
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,750
From that. There was a live broadcast from the broadcasting room a while ago. Everyone here heard it.

201
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,370
He won't even pay alimony. What a huge fool!

202
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,740
- Fool?
- He's trash!

203
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,080
Trash?

204
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,300
She should be home taking care of her child. Why is she at school seducing a younger boy?

205
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,380
It's the end of the world now. It's a crazy world.

206
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,990
I feel like I might lose my mind.

207
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,580
So, they could've married during high school and had a child.

208
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,540
That girl isn't normal.

209
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,080
Why do you keep talking about the girl? Why does it matter?

210
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,480
- What is this?
- What are you?

211
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,240
Is this a contest right now?

212
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,600
Hey, hey. Stay still. She's the history major that goes crazy when drunk.

213
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,720
Leave her alone.

214
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,740
It's so cool! Divorce is so cool.

215
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,650
Why does she have to be loya? They're both going to live separately now.

216
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,460
Ah, it's so cool!

217
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,970
Is the broadcasting club practicing a drama script?

218
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,130
Oh, yeah. They do radio dramas sometimes.

219
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,870
This is from the broadcasting club.

220
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,830
The accident that happened previously is unrelated to us.

221
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,400
We are currently investigating what happened.

222
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,640
- They divorced recently.
- His first love is from this school.

223
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,420
I really hate this.

224
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,310
Hey, apparently the guy's first love goes to this school.

225
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,360
What?

226
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,680
What do we do now?

227
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,550
What am I supposed to do?

228
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,620
Okay, so let's just forget about the guy for a second. What about the girl? She has a child at that age.

229
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,600
That bastard.

230
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,340
Cheon Seol? You swear?

231
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,540
He seduced an innocent girl and got her pregnant.

232
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,340
That bastard. I'm not letting him get away with this.

233
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,980
Hey, he didn't get her pregnant. They were married. A couple.

234
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,890
He isn't even giving her alimony!

235
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,090
But, why are you saying this to me?

236
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,090
Anyway, they left the child because they didn't want to be responsible for him.

237
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,390
That doesn't make sense!

238
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,650
What's it with you two?

239
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,600
Everyone's freaking out right now about finding them.

240
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,420
There aren't many clues, but judging by how the couple fought so viciously,

241
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,040
they aren't on good terms. Hey, do you guys know anyone who fight for no reason like that?

242
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,270
They're harder to find usually if they're closer to you.

243
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,930
Hm... I, I wonder. Jin Joo, is there someone like that who you know?

244
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,380
I don't think so, Ban Do.

245
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,820
Ah, I see. There isn't anyone like that.

246
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,680
Eat it well!

247
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,220
Is it refreshing?

248
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,040
Mm! It's really refreshing.

249
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,810
"Both of them said they aren't raising the child."

250
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,670
"Both of them aren't even humans."

251
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,900
"They say he always hit the girl."

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,020
"Really? He's so trashy!"

253
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,440
"She was a gold digger. She wanted alimony, so she intentionally planned it."

254
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,060
"The boy's such trash!"

255
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,150
"Same with the girl."

256
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,070
The two are the same.

257
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,150
The only thing revealed was our voice.

258
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,640
I don't think anyone has caught on.

259
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,910
Why are they calling a normal person like me a gold digger?

260
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,110
You're the one who seduced me.

261
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,600
Hey, I'm apparently an abuser.

262
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,430
You're the one who would hit me, but I never even touched the tips of your hair.

263
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,640
OK, whatever. But, we can't argue when we're in front of everyone.

264
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,820
Got it.

265
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Why'd you take me to that broadcasting room?

266
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,370
I didn't know how it would end.

267
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,380
When I told you not to contact Director Park,

268
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,340
you should've politely gone with it. Because you didn't, it turned into this mess!

269
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,800
So, this is my fault?

270
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,130
Then, is it mine?

271
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,330
What are you two doing here? Whose fault is what?

272
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,450
It's the blind date's fault. How we got this close.

273
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,910
That's true. It's because of the meeting.

274
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,700
Well, then.

275
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,310
Let's go, Cheon Seol.

276
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,140
We're going first, Ban Do.

277
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,010
Okay, Jin Joo! Bye!

278
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,560
Excuse me...

279
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,240
The club.

280
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,860
Director-

281
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,750
Oh, the note!

282
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,570
You remember.

283
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,860
You're from this school, huh?

284
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,560
Yesterday, on the stage, you were the best.

285
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,930
But, I think I made a mistake yesterday.

286
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,170
- What?
- I should've gotten your number.

287
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,580
I gave you mine instead.

288
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,060
But, it must be fate. We met again.

289
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,620
Can you give me your number this time?

290
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,440
Of course!

291
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,180
That stupid woman.

292
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,820
Here, you go. My number.

293
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,030
I'll contact you.

294
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,660
Okay! Then ...

295
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,750
She has to be hit in the back of her head to understand.

296
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,250
Who does he think he is?

297
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,370
Who?

298
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,920
What? It's nothing.

299
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,530
I don't know. It isn't my business.

300
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,350
Who is it?

301
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,370
It's nothing.

302
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,990
Hey, excuse me! Move aside!

303
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,450
Why does she keep appearing in front of me?

304
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,510
Are you really going to do it?

305
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,730
I have to do something.

306
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,220
Please save me!

307
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,780
Please save me! Please save me!

308
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,650
After class, don't be late and come to the reference library.

309
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,910
It's an event for the freshman.

310
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,370
Everyone should attend.

311
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,260
- Got it?
- Yes.

312
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,070
Is he here to complain about something?

313
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,880
Wow, would you look at how thin his face got?

314
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,760
Still, he's already given false hope to someone who's already confessed to him, among others.

315
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,540
But... Did he really not marry for 18 years because he couldn't forget me?

316
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,030
Hey.

317
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,580
Hey?

318
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,350
I'm asking because I want to make sure.

319
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,550
You don't think I like you, right?

320
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,040
What?

321
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,030
Uh...  What is he saying?

322
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,150
It's true.

323
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,850
Wow. You really thought it was that.

324
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,000
I mean, you confessed to me.

325
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,820
I never confessed to you.

326
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,800
I mean, you asked me out.

327
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,900
I only asked you out, I didn't say I liked you.

328
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,300
What?

329
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,100
What is he doing? Is he getting revenge now because he was rejected?

330
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,560
Well, you normally have to like someone to date them.

331
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,760
- Then, why'd you ask me out?
- Because you were in front of me.

332
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,750
Because I was in front of you? What if someone else was?

333
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,610
I would've asked her out.

334
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,970
You understand now, right? So, don't flirt with me.

335
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,260
Like... this.

336
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,580
That kind of thing.

337
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,200
Don't do it.

338
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,820
I'm going.

339
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,570
So, you ask someone in front of you to date you?

340
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,620
What is that? Then..

341
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,860
In the past, he never liked me.

342
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,040
Why'd he tell me now after 18 years?

343
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,970
He shouldn't have told me.

344
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,770
He shouldn't have.

345
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,690
It's Yoon Bo Reum.

346
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,810
Tomorrow, come to room 201 in the Student's Building at 2 P.M.

347
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,100
Put strength into it!

348
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,140
With spirit!

349
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,130
Who are you?

350
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,000
Application for Asura Cheerleading.

351
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,770
Are you kidding me? My body isn't fit for that kind of thing.

352
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,150
But, I wrote this?

353
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,490
It's true. You wrote it.

354
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,740
It's your handwriting.

355
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,310
Yeah, that's true. This fingerprint... Is it mine?

356
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,210
Hey! I don't make drunk people do weird things like that.

357
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,580
- What's that?
- Oh, this?

358
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,470
It's the application for my club. I'm going to give it to people who want to join it.

359
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,330
You want to do it?

360
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,610
Me?

361
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,710
If you do it, you'll be practicing next to me every day.

362
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,780
Really?

363
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,660
Should I do it?

364
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,380
Ahn Jae Woo

365
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,020
Ahn Jae Woo

366
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,480
Asura

367
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,310
3, 4,

368
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,740
1, 2! Match the rhythm!

369
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,490
Hey! Did you go on a nationwide tour?

370
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,240
Why are you having so much trouble?

371
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,160
Do it again!

372
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,820
Oh wow

373
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,580
♬ Even in moments of breathtaking living ♬

374
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,850
♬ We will help out each other like this ♬

375
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,320
♬ There are still a lot of days left to me ♬

376
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,030
♬ I want to spend the rest with you ♬

377
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:07,740
♬ Even if I lose everything, I will love you.  ♬

378
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:17,000
♬ I can't give you up. ♬

379
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,390
♬ Even if it's anywhere in the world  ♬

380
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:28,580
♬ I can feel your breath  ♬

381
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,040
♬ Until the end of my life  ♬

382
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,950
♬ I will always be with you. ♬

383
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,620
What? What?

384
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,470
Min Seo Young! Come to your senses!

385
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,510
It's obvious when the main solo has a rough and heavy body.

386
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,260
Are you really going to control your weight like this?

387
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,200
I am... But I'm the type to not be able to gain or lose weight easily.

388
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,900
Is that an excuse?

389
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,480
You guys should drink these, too.

390
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,010
Here, here.

391
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,770
I'm on a diet, though.

392
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,870
I have to diet...

393
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,290
It's good!

394
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:47,720
Seo Young! Come here. He brought snacks for you.

395
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,010
Hi. You must've been somewhere just now.

396
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,910
Yeah... Hi.

397
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,700
Come, sit.

398
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,790
I thought your sugar levels dropped, so I brought these sugary things.

399
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,850
Wow, you have good sense!

400
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,500
When we practice a lot, we crave sugary things.

401
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,160
How'd you know?

402
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,590
I read about it.

403
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,090
Life is always bitter. Practice, too.

404
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,800
You have to eat sugary things from time to time so you can endure the bitter times to get to the sweet taste.

405
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,790
- You have a point.
- You're fun.

406
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,790
Here. It won't get on your fingers if you eat it like this.

407
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,310
No, I'm good.

408
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,010
I think I have an upset stomach.

409
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,420
Oh, really?

410
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,790
What is he doing?

411
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,960
He's not her boyfriend, right?

412
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,080
I've never been able to talk to Seo Young.

413
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,500
Hey, guys! Come here. Let's eat together.

414
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,440
Us?

415
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,070
Is he calling us?

416
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,220
Yeah, you guys.

417
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,990
So, I hope everyone can practice hard and well.

418
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,310
When you're about to forget me, I'll come again with sugary things.

419
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,150
Hey... I'm going.

420
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm going! Bye!

421
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,910
Bye! Come again!

422
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,710
I didn't know, but he's pretty alright!

423
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,630
It's so perfect! I've attacked her surroundings.

424
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,830
I think he likes you a lot, when we look at how he's been treating us.

425
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,920
Is that it?

426
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,760
Thanks for the food. You thought about us, too.

427
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,730
That was all planned out, too.

428
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,030
Midlife relaxation.

429
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,810
Yeah. Good luck!

430
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,070
Seo Young! Are you okay? Get up!

431
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,420
What do we do?

432
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,180
What is this? What happened?

433
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,490
Don't we have to call 119? (119 is like 911)

434
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,660
- Can you help me?
- Yeah.

435
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,330
- Where's the nurse's room?
- At the end after you take a right.

436
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,390
What do we do?

437
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,210
Is she a feather? Why is she so skinny?

438
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:23,280
Attention! Over there is the reference library.

439
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,000
You probably heard rumors. A long time ago

440
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,290
but inside, a freshman once hanged herself.

441
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:39,770
After that, people have been saying they saw the ghost.

442
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,270
If one person goes inside

443
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,530
and finds the designated reference data,

444
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,520
we will buy you all drinks.

445
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,280
No one has succeeded so far.

446
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,500
- We're going in there?
- I'm scared.

447
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,300
Don't Look Back!

448
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,910
How is that scary? They're overreacting.

449
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,260
Absolutely overreacting.

450
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,310
What is it?

451
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,090
Is it real?

452
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,540
It's real! A real ghost!

453
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,840
Gosh, this is so scary!

454
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,040
Who's going next?

455
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,100
What is this? No one?

456
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,090
At least one more person should go.

457
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,980
This year, too, no one will find it.

458
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,640
No one is going in.

459
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,110
Ma Jin Joo?

460
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,490
Did a ghost really appear or something?

461
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,590
Be brave.

462
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,070
Gosh, that scared me!

463
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,640
Mom, I'm so scared!

464
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,590
Geez, that scared me!

465
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,210
Ugh, what is this?

466
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,640
Don't come after me!

467
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,010
Don't come closer!

468
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,330
Senior...

469
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,270
Senior!

470
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,640
I remember you were hiding there. Did you think you would fool me twice?

471
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,640
One more of them left after being frightened.

472
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,590
Why did that freshman die here?

473
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,630
How scary.

474
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:16,150
Okay, I sent all of them out. Let's find the reference data now.

475
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,750
I saw it. OMG I saw it!

476
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,340
Did we end or what?

477
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,570
Red envelope..

478
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:55,770
Let's see. Red envelope..

479
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,560
I found it.

480
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,550
Oh, here.

481
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,560
Thanks to me, everyone will have a great meal today.

482
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,120
How is this fun?

483
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:20,600
Oh, kids.

484
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:44,160
♫  Baby, inside your clear eyes ♫

485
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,780
♫ I want to be in your eyes and I want to feel your heart forever ♫

486
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,310
♫ Your lovely voice ♫

487
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:02,830
♫ I want to be swept by you as if to throw myself at you ♫

488
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:11,440
♫ I'm lacking a lot now ♫

489
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,200
♫ In my heart, in my eyes ♫

490
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,430
♫ I wish you can see my genuine heart ♫

491
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,250
I woke up because of my stomach.

492
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,270
You must've heard it, too.

493
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,080
What?

494
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,870
If you're up, let's go.

495
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,070
Where?

496
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,600
You two should never be separated.

497
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,010
Oh, yes. This is it. It's so good!

498
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,220
What are you doing? I'm not eating.

499
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,730
- Yeah. Don't eat.
- What?

500
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,620
The nurse said you're watching your weight right now.

501
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,280
Don't eat it and then blame me. Just don't eat it.

502
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,780
Then why am I sitting here?

503
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,990
Hold on. It's so good!

504
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,830
Just watch me eat.

505
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,290
I wanted to eat pork belly so bad, but I didn't have any friends to eat it with.

506
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,790
We have each other's number. You could do this.

507
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,430
- Do you just want one? Just one.
- What?

508
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,180
Never mind. What am I doing to someone who's controlling her weight?

509
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,060
No, no. I'm sorry.

510
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,740
Hey!

511
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,690
Am I just a sidekick? Why should I just watch? I can eat just one.

512
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,420
You can't...

513
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,460
It's so good!

514
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,730
You. I thought you were only going to eat one.

515
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,220
I meant one... meal. I'm eating one meal.

516
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,620
I see. Yeah, eat up.

517
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,020
If you eat well, you don't gain weight. It's 0 calories.

518
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,530
What are you saying?

519
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,430
There's something like that.

520
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,530
How silly.

521
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,330
Why would I get nervous there? To a kid?

522
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,480
I mean... This is my first time coming this far in this event.

523
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,240
If you were hidden, you should've said so.

524
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,810
If I were to tell you, why would I be hiding?

525
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,410
That's true, but...

526
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,490
Gosh, he's sassy.

527
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:43,220
I told you not to flirt with me.

528
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,150
I don't think I did this time.

529
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,310
You were the one who saved me yourself.

530
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:54,450
I'm sure you saved me because I was right in front of you, but.. Thank you.

531
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,740
I think everything's finished. Are you not leaving?

532
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,880
I'm fine, you can go first.

533
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,950
Oh, my. Did you get hurt?

534
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,670
Let me see.

535
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,710
Hey, hey! Why are you touching a man's leg?

536
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,050
Oh, you!  He thinks he's a man.

537
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,270
Let me see.

538
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,300
Oh, it's swollen!

539
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,100
You should've saved me carefully! It looks painful.

540
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,720
If you sprain it, it lasts forever.

541
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,930
Just move it a little.

542
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,680
Leave me be.

543
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:51,030
Why do you keep talking informally to me?

544
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:04,550
Hey, what are you doing?

545
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,860
Just go. You can't walk anyway.

546
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,740
I told you not to do these things.

547
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,320
Walk carefully.

548
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:16,730
Thank you for the food!

549
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,480
I've lost my mind.

550
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,030
Miss, I'll have this.

551
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,880
Let's go. Because you ate with enjoyment, we have to make it zero calories.

552
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,290
What?

553
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,670
Instead of getting stressed from not being able to do what you want, isn't it better to just do it?

554
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,400
We're all just trying to eat and live.

555
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,230
Eating what you want isn't as harsh as I thought.

556
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,820
Life isn't always harsh and tough.

557
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,560
If you do what you want, everything ends up working out.

558
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,950
Instead of getting pregnant women stressed because they can't have coffee or alcohol,

559
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,720
the doctors say to have it once in a while if they want to so badly.

560
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,000
That doesn't make sense. To a pregnant woman?

561
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,010
It's true. My wife-

562
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,410
...When my sister was pregnant, she said it.

563
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,670
What's with you so suddenly?

564
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,460
Huh? What?

565
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,540
Well...

566
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:09,650
Before this, you used to not be able to talk to me. You ran away and hid.

567
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,500
What?

568
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,430
But, suddenly you've asked for my number and you come find me first.

569
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,660
You just seem like a different person.

570
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,720
You knew that I used to hide?

571
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah. It was the first time I saw someone who hid so badly.

572
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,240
Forget who I was in the past. He was like a fool, right?

573
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,360
What's the meaning behind that smile?

574
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,920
♫  I'm thinking I'm in love... ♫

575
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,010
♫  You woke up my heart that had stopped. ♫

576
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,560
♫  You are very sweet. ♫

577
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,890
This is so nice!

578
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh, right. The air in Seoul used to be like this.

579
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,220
Without all the fine dust, the sight is so clear!

580
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,250
What's that? Fine dust?

581
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,220
There's something like that. Air from China.

582
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,970
China sells air?

583
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,570
In the future, probably.

584
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,360
What are you saying?

585
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,500
♫  Let's go together! ♫

586
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,240
This is so nice. This is my first time coming somewhere like this.

587
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,940
♫  I'll walk one step closer. ♫

588
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,330
♫  Like that, I keep... ♫

589
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,560
How did you know my shoe size?
♫ ...smiling. ♫

590
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,950
Huh? Oh..

591
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,950
I eyeballed it.

592
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,410
What?

593
00:46:53,410 --> 00:47:00,300
♫ Knocking on my heart ♫

594
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,950
♫ Let me in your mind. ♫

595
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:19,070
To the people who forget history, there is no future for them!

596
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:29,250
I didn't think Ma Jin Joo would succeed. How amazing!

597
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:34,730
Ma Jin Joo! Ma Jin Joo!

598
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:39,240
Ghosts? What's so scary about them? People are scarier.

599
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,520
This.

600
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,000
You should use this. It looked swollen earlier.

601
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,530
You don't have to worry.

602
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:07,260
Wow, you're bad at listening to people.

603
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,410
Move. Here.

604
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,010
Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

605
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,410
You got hurt because of me. I have a duty. How could I not care?

606
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,520
It's not like you have 2nd year middle schooler disease.What kind of man is so prim.

607
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,700
Don't remove it. Keep it on until all the inflammation goes down. Got it?

608
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,880
Jin Joo, where'd you go?

609
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,570
Let's drink!

610
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,040
What is this? Is she a doctor?

611
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,650
Ah, so refreshing!

612
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,070
Cheers!

613
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,100
Why does she keep speaking informally?

614
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,630
It's so great!

615
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,170
Jin Joo, you need to drain it in one go!

616
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,320
No, no. Let it be. Never mind. Let's go for it. Who's gonna set it up?

617
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,890
One shot! One shot!

618
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,020
There!

619
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,790
It's so refreshing.

620
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,070
Cheon Seol. Why are you drinking juice?

621
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,660
You and I usually don't drink alcohol.

622
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,590
But, still. Let's drink.

623
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,510
When you get married later, you're not going to be able to drink because there's no time.

624
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,150
Married?

625
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:51,600
Still, I don't like looking at people get loose after drinking is a bit weird.

626
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:01,250
Seol, you know it's okay to kinda be a bit loose.

627
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,930
If you don't play when you need to play because of what others might think of you, you're the only one who loses.

628
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,300
You know there's a time for it all too!

629
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,870
When you do it when you get old, that's even more of an eyesore.

630
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,530
Right now, it's

631
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,780
the perfect time to drink and have fun.

632
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,090
Hey, guys. Today, drink what you want

633
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,770
without worrying about what others think.

634
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:29,800
For the people who don't know their history, there's no future.

635
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,010
There's no future! None!

636
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,370
To the people who forget their history, there is no future.

637
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,620
Hey. What's Cheon Seol doing over there?

638
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,730
I should take this with me.

639
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:00,120
This spicy one, too.

640
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,460
Fried and spicy, half half!

641
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,710
That hurt!

642
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,310
Hey, did the table not break?

643
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,940
I think the table's crushed.

644
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:42,000
Seniors, please take Cheon Seol back safely.

645
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,720
Please take me back safely!

646
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,640
Roll call! Cheon Seol can't miss roll call.

647
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,090
There's still a lot of time left until roll call.

648
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,700
Hey, you should just go.

649
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:03,950
Okay. I will go.
♬ When the years go by, will you know  ♬

650
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,860
♬ The reason the flowers fade?♬

651
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,120
Hey, do you want to take one?

652
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,410
♬ I will see again the other people who left me.  ♬

653
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:26,160
♬ Encountering other people ♬

654
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:32,160
She should take care of herself.
♬  in relationships and longing ♬

655
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,980
♬  Where does it lead? ♬

656
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:46,040
♬ With my small wisdom I can't know. ♬

657
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:52,840
♬ The only thing I know is how to live. ♬

658
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:59,850
♬ Moreover those failures and difficult times ♬

659
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:07,830
♬ cannot be avoided. That's what I realized. ♬

660
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:14,130
♬ Now that solution is love. ♬

661
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:21,540
♬ I'm going to love everything in this world.♬

662
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:42,400
♬ More over, the failures and difficulties. (Difficulties) ♬

663
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:50,120
♬ Cannot be avoided, is what we all realized.  ♬

664
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:56,730
♬ Now that solution is love.  ♬

665
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:03,640
♬ I am going to love everything in this world. ♬

666
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:11,410
♬ I am going to love everything in this world  ♬

667
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:20,350
♬ These things in the world, I will love them. ♬

668
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:50,680
Let me know if you want to let it out. I'll always help make your encore.

669
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,570
You're too young to hold things in. Right?

670
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:02,690
No... Thanks for today. But, don't do that again.

671
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,050
I've never not been first place in the youth competitions.

672
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:14,920
I got this far because I've stayed strong and endured it all.

673
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,230
Not just luck.

674
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,420
Thanks, though.

675
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,110
I want to get to know you better.

676
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,720
Oh, the bus is coming.

677
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,240
I'm going.

678
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,660
Okay, bye!

679
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,150
Bye!

680
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,870
Yes!! Yes!! Yes!! Yes!!

681
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:03,050
I did good. I did good.

682
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,090
It's hot at this time, too.

683
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,300
Summer is summer.

684
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,900
Honey.

685
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,080
I said it's hot! It's hot!

686
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,420
Hey. It's hot!

687
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,900
I didn't go back.

688
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,100
Oh?

689
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,730
What is this? Why are you doing the dishes?

690
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,830
Are you going to get married?

691
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,730
Do you have to marry to do the dishes? You can rest, Mom.

692
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:51,530
Move away. You're going to do it for the rest of your life when you marry, anyway. Why start already?

693
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,190
Mom, you're going to do it until you die.

694
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,140
Did you get mature?

695
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,490
I don't know when that immaturity will return, so when that happens just think that's how it is.

696
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,620
What are you saying?

697
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,530
Just rest.

698
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,780
Sit, Mom. Rest!

699
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,700
Look at this.

700
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,660
How much is this?

701
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,810
₩5,000.

702
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,730
This is ₩5,000.

703
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,300
Mom, you like grapes.

704
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,500
Oh, you're right. They look good.

705
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,290
It's okay. I'm the only one who would eat it, anyway.

706
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:33,410
You and your dad go crazy over watermelon.

707
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:39,390
Just buy it. I'm just wild about wanting to eat grapes today.

708
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,620
Grapes? You don't even eat them.

709
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:45,650
I love grapes! Because I take after you.

710
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,430
Oh, right. I forgot to get the pictures.

711
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,510
Gosh, look at my state of mind.

712
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:05,470
The photographer next to the market? - yeah.

713
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,850
Mom, you can go. I'll get it.

714
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,330
Sorry.

715
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,220
To Ms. Go Eun Sook.

716
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,960
Oh, who left this here?

717
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,850
Young man

718
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,120
If you bump into someone, you should apologize.

719
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,670
Because of you, don't you see what you did!

720
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:59,770
Then, you should be holding onto them properly!

721
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,200
What?

722
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,720
I'm right in front of my house. You bumped into me.

723
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,720
What's up with this ajumma! From the morning, how unlucky.

724
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,340
So, what. What do you want me to do?

725
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,690
This person..

726
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,000
What's with you! You tiny thing to an adult!

727
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,920
What?

728
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,500
Wow, what's with today? What's with this neighborhood?

729
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,990
If you bump an adult you need to sincerely apologize

730
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,400
or compensate. You young thing!

731
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,360
Yeah! You little bastard.

732
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,270
Wow. You must both be crazy.

733
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,290
What's with you? Who are you to interfere!

734
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,760
Me?

735
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,820
I'm her son. Why?

736
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:54,610
Son? No wonder.

737
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,430
You two better consider yourselves lucky.

738
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,980
What?

739
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,060
Has no manners that kid.

740
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,230
Are you okay?

741
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,980
Oh, yes.

742
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,890
Thank you.

743
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,710
Your mom must be so proud. I only have two daughters.

744
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,640
You're sending your daughter off, what's with your expression?

745
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,320
Your expression is so happy.

746
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:45,360
Of course it's a celebration! In a son-less household, I got a son like this for free!

747
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,120
You must be so happy.

748
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,830
Hey!

749
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,910
Oh, my!

750
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,740
Mom, go inside.

751
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,960
Hey, what's with you? This student...

752
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,590
Mom, just go inside first.

753
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,660
Just go.

754
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:27,280
I was just passing by.

755
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,900
Why did you come here?

756
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,340
Did you come to see Mom?

757
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:58,320
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry Mother-in-Law.

758
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,300
I'm so sorry!

759
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,590
Go Back Couple

760
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:49,350
You're weird these days. Not only do you dream I'm dead.

761
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:52,490
- Are you dating Yoon Bo Reum?
- Dating?

762
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,760
It wasn't even a kiss, it was a slight peck.

763
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,780
It's not as good if you eat by yourself.

764
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:59,160
It's here right?

765
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,520
Did I do something wrong?

766
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,900
It's not like I'm cheating!

767
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,080
Why is she here?

768
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,040
You said we'd go to the hospital. Why are we here?

769
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,660
You told me not to flirt and that you didn't confess.

770
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,600
It's not a confession. I'm in the process of seducing.
