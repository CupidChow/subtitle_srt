00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,720
Seo Jin, Mom's clothes came in!

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,460
I haven't bought a dress in years. Right?

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,500
To: Ma Jin Joo

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,550
Oh, geez! Why is this so short?

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,840
If I wear this and hold Seo Jin,

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,390
my underwear will be revealed to everyone. Right, Seo Jin?

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,690
I have to return this.

8
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,010
It's pretty, though.

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,240
When I was young, I used to think age was just a number.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,460
I, Ma Jin Joo, is in this world and...

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,440
my age was just a number that was seeping into me.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm a mother in her late thirties.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,930
Would it be okay to wear a dress that comes above my knees?

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,820
Do people wear short dresses after having children?

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,710
I couldn't wear those dresses after I reached mid-thirties.

16
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,910
I thought people would think I was an ajumma desperate to look young?

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,650
Me, too. After I had a child, I've only been wearing long dresses or pants.

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,980
Yeah, but if you look good in it, isn't that the only thing that matters?

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,720
Yeah, that's true. If it looks good on me, I'm wearing it.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,110
- Tada!
- Gosh, that scared me.

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,610
How is it? It's pretty, right?

22
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:50,560
Are you a kid? Why's an old woman showing her legs like that? Act like your age.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,450
Seo Jin, where are you? Dad's here.

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,460
Seo Jin, where are you? Dad is here. Where are you, our Seo Jin?

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,510
- He's sleeping.
- Oh, really?

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,250
But I knew one year after another as that number got bigger.

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,180
The age doesn't seep into me.

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,520
I'm learning to act according to that number.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,590
That's how I adjusted myself to my age.

His shoulders aren't even broad enough for them to be wet like that.

My shoulders are pretty much the same width.

No, geez.

Quiet! Be quiet! Now that the rain has stopped and it's festival season.

- Yes.

75
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm in the mood. Class canceled today!

Fine. You and your first love. Go ahead and enjoy the love you couldn't fulfill.

Do you think I wanted to go? It just ended up that way.

81
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,820
Besides, he doesn't even know who I am.

82
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,440
So, you almost told him in person. "Hello, Father-in-law..." Geez.

83
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,820
I lived like that for the past 18 years. Of course it would come out automatically!

84
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,120
You don't even know when you're going back in time. You already seduced a boy?

85
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,340
You're sticking by his side like gum.

86
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,550

Min Seo Young had an umbrella this morning!

90
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,980
- An umbrella? She had one?
- Yeah.

91

You have no idea how sly kids are these days.

92
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,970
Is it true?

93
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,770
What's with you? Are you crazy?

94
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,060
That's cute. That means she wanted to share an umbrella with me. What fire fox?

95
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,330
That kind of thing is a teenage drama.

96
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,360
Your head is full of provocative storylines, Ahjumma...

97
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,260
What? Provocative storyline? What teenage drama? It's a bitter meltdown of an old ahjussi!

98
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,970
- Love and war!
- Bitter meltdown melodrama?

99
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,540
Love and War?

100
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,420
Can you let me borrow that video?

101
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,430
What genre do you like? Western? Japanese?

102
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,610
Oh, my Jin Joo...

103
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,350
There are about a thousand videos according to genres in his secret folder. Ask him for them.

You're healthy.

Is this your best? Are you sure?

Let go!

137
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,200
With this one decision, in the future,

138
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,660
You'll only think of shredding, dry him out, or burn him to death until you turn 40...

139
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,590
You'll die an old spinster. I won't care about you anymore then.

140
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,250
Why jump to conclusions? You have no idea whether you'll die today or tomorrow in life.

141
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,990
Why would I think about it for 18 years? That'd give me a headache.

If it's all good right now, that's what matters.

Isn't it so cute?

Oh, of course, Seol, you're sensible.

149
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,700
What do you mean start dating when? Why put a date on it?

150
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,590
This is frustrating.

151
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,700
Two days since we started dating!

152
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,680

Gosh, that scared me!

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,220
You remember? We've waiting for this ever since school started.

157
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,470
Go to the campus video! (KBS Program c. 1998-2003)

158
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,970
Of course, I remember. The black history label that would only end when I die.

159
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,020
The culprit!

160
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,890
Nurse Mi Gyeong

161
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,460
- Right? That's him, right?
- That's right.

162
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,210
- Team Leader Choi.
- Hi!

163
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,270
Isn't this you?

164
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,060
You had this in you?

165
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,690
Hey, I heard it's you. Where did you get this outfit? You look cool.

166
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,210
Well.. That time, I was a bit crazy, so...

167
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,150
Now I understand.

168
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,230
The future sent me back for this moment.

169
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,480
Okay. Great.

170
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,990
Look, friends. Whatever you're thinking of right now, forget it.

171
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:33,650
This? No. Don't do it. I'm not doing it, either.

172
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,680
Hey, what are you saying?

173
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,520
You said you wanted to come out on TV in the beginning of the semester. You're the one who planned this!

174
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,720
But it looks like he found hard to find materials. Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

175
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,590
- But I think this will make for a very memorable event for our college years.
- Right?

176
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:54,860
Yeah, sure. Guys, that memory will haunt you until the die.

177
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,460
In any case, I'm leaving. Good luck!

178
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,550
Hey, where are you going, Ban Do?

179
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,480
You're really going to the library and not the school festival?

180
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,340
If the old seniors like us are sitting around at booths, the hoobaes will talk bad about us.

181
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,420
Right, you never really cared about these things.

182
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,080
It's been forever since I came to the school festival!

183
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,790
I thought you weren't interested in school festivals. I guess not?

184
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,200
School festivals and parties are good things.

185
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
You have to attend these things while you can. Later on, you're going to have to pay.

186
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,690
Paying to go to a school festival?

187
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,640
Festivals and carnivals... there's no place in Korea that doesn't have celebrations like that.

188
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,890
If you have time and money to go to those things, that's good.

189
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,230
It's our department's booth.

190
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,190
Oh, that looks so heavy. I'll help.

191
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,110
- Should I put it over there?
- Yeah.

192
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,910
Young girls don't have a lot of strength.

193
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,770
Here, here.

194
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,730
Thank you, thank you!

195
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,520
Hey! Be careful of the water.

196
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,260
If you get oil in water, that's bad!

197
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,620
You'll cause so much trouble.

198
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:24,210
Today, you know... I think the sun rose from the east, right?

199
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,470
Hi, Oppa!

200
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,790
He's never showed up at school's festival for the last three years. What's going on?

201
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,970
It's his last festival. He's in graduating class.

202
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,770
If he's a senior, and everyone's setting things up, why is he just sitting there?

203
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,720
You're throwing away all the precious meaty parts.

204
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,180
Hold the body of the knife and peel the skin only.

205
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,250
Oh... you spoke casually?

206
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,920
I mean please.

207
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,010
Okay, hold on, Mom.

208
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:19,460
So... Just a little sugar and a lot of red chili paste. Got it.

209
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:26,710
A little sugar.. Little? A little.

210
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,250
Little... Yeah.

211
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,870
Oh, hey!

212
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,430
- Hey!
-This much would be "little."

213
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,450
With that amount, you won't even taste it.

214
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,610
You.. You know how to do this?

215
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,760
Hey, I could make spicy stir-fried pork with my eyes closed.

216
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,300
You didn't just throw everything together, right?

217
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,720
That doubt of yours.

218
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,080
Oh, it's so good! Wow, Jin Joo!

219
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,200
Here, Cheon Seol.

220
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,720
- Me, too.
- It's good.

221
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,790
Hey, Jin Joo. This is going to be our main dish.

222
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,270
That's a good idea, right?

223
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,290
Hey, it isn't even that great.

224
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,620
You guys will make an even bigger deal if I try making the other dishes, then.

225
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,810
Then... How many servings do I make?

226
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:18,850
I don't think we'll have a lot of customers, so we won't make too much. About... a hundred servings?

227
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,680
A hundred servings?

228
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,380
The delivery arrived!

229
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,660
Straighten out your face. We won't make you do all this by yourself.

230
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,640
It's about time they came..

231
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:03,020
♫  When I look at you, everything stops. ♫

232
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:10,050
♫  I don't even know when it started. ♫

233
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:16,250
♫ You came to me like a dream, you shook my heart ♫

234
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,870
The special forces take care of our country and as for our food stand every year...

235
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,240
cooks in the reserve army take care of us.

236
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,610
♫ I love you ♫

237
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,660
We did such a tough job.

238
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,000
Good job. It's our festival. Enjoy yourselves.

239
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,950
Okay!

240
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,800
- Oh, Min Seo Young.
- Yes?

241
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,430
These days, you're in good shape. Keep it up. And keep going with your weight management.

242
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,520
Okay!

243
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,640
What's with you? You're always smiling these days and there's no stopping.

244
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,440
You're in good shape, too. Is it a boy?

245
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,520
You shouldn't be practicing so hard. Look for a place to release your stress.

246
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,480
Seeing a man would be a good strategy.

247
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,270
I'm glad the rain stopped.

248
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,080
You didn't even have an umbrella. What were you going to do if you hadn't bumped into me?

249
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,750
Huh? Oh... Right. I didn't even have an umbrella. What a relief I saw you.

250
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,270
Ah... Campus music video pop. Are you going to enter?

251
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,770
That? No, I'm not doing that.

252
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,660
I'm not a kid. Why would I try so hard to be on air?

253
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:03,740
Why? It looks fun, do it. It'll be cool to see you on TV.

254
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,880
Really? Nah, it's okay.

255
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,530
You shouldn't cross a river you can't return. It's best to lead a quiet life.

256
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:19,290
You always say to me, "Do what's fun for you! Do whatever you want!" But you're so careful yourself.

257
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,300
Really?

258
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,120
Hold on.

259
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,790
Hi, Mom.

260
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,840
I don't want to do it.

261
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,040
Why would I enter a competition I won't even win?

262
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,130
I don't want to!

263
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm hanging up.

264
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,380
Wow, that was scary. You know how to get annoyed.

265
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,190
How could a person only have good characteristics?

266
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,410
Who said you only have good characteristics?

267
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,470
Hey!

268
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,940
In the army, you can scoop rice and soup with this. You can do everything.

269
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,090
With this amount, we can think one spoonful of food is equal to one shovelful.

270
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,140
Hey, Jin Joo. If you were going to help out at food stands, you should've entered the May Queen competition.

271
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,980
May Queen?

272
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,910
Oh, yeah! I... I was one of the candidates in May Queen contest at the beginning of the semester, huh?

273
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,180
Right.

274
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,830
While I'm in the student body of humantities department...

275
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,960
I hoped our department would produce a May Queen candidate.

276
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,460
You insisted that you won't enter.

277
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:04,190
Wow, that's right. I must've really been that pretty.

278
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,640
Geez...

279
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:12,140
Done, it's all done! You can't even leave one speck of leftover.

280
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,490
Hey, what do we do with this?

281
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,630
What are you doing? I don't have any other clothes.

282
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm sorry, are you okay? It doesn't look that bad.

283
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,660
- What the heck?
- I knew this would happen when you were acting up.

284
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,610
Are you okay? You have the most on you. What do we do?

285
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,630
Hey, I can just put it in the laundry when I go home.

286
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,700
I'm so sorry!

287
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,130
Why are you doing that?

288
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,880
What's with you?

289
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,790
Hey, did someone put drugs in his?

290
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,990
Ugh, what do I do?

291
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,170
Hey, you're performing.

292
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,420
Just wipe it off quickly.

293
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,160
Wait, no! You can't do it like that.

294
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,810
What?

295
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,020
This is oily. If you add water, it will spread even more.

296
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,790
Just drop it like this and just that spot like this...

297
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:59,420
Rub, rub, rub, rub, rub. Wash it off.

298
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,780
Tada!

299
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:09,010
Wow, you're right! Aw, Jae Woo, where did you learn these things?

300
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:15,500
You're so meticulous. That's why I like you!

301
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,600
What the heck... so frustrating.

302
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh, Go Dok. Hi.

303
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,250
Hey! Don't you think you're being too much here?

304
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,340
- What?
-  What?

305
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,320
Ugh, you.

306
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,910
Miss, three glasses of beer, please!

307
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,210
Hi!

308
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,220
What is this? Kissing in the morning as a greeting, a "see you at lunch" kiss, and a goodnight kiss?

309
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,610
I can't even count how many times you guys kissed yesterday and today with all of my ten fingers.

310
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,460
What is she? A pervert? Is she dating you just to kiss you?

311
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,320
What kind of person would date just to kiss someone?

312
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,730
Where else? There are several types of people who date each other.

313
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,090
As for me, I want to date a real sexy woman.

314
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,990
But I also want to date a really cute woman when I see one.

315
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,620
I also want to date an older woman and also a younger woman.

316
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,350
What are you saying? You're crazy.

317
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,810
So, what I'm saying is... Everyone has a reason to date someone.

318
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:30,180
Just like how you're dating her because you like her, she has a reason for dating you, too.

319
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,340
A reason.

320
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,110
is your body.

321
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,960
- Body?
- is body.

322
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,340
Ow, hey... my stomach is getting twisted up.

323
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,460
- Oh, man, I have to poop.
- That bastard, how gross!

324
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,120
What about the body?

325
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,510
Hey! Of course! It's right that you'd think that.

326
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,410
There's so many people who date just for the physical aspect of it.

327
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,830
I mean, it's not that I don't like it, but...

328
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:14,080
But, I think about it from time to time. Are we just dating to do that kind of thing?

329
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,050
I wonder if I look that easy to him... And I wonder if he even likes me.

330
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,910
I wonder if he's just dating me to touch me.

331
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,790
That bastard! Is he a pervert?

332
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,250
Hey, is she a pervert?

333
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,890
Is she dating you just to kiss you?

334
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,450
Wow, it's really a school festival!

335
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,740
It's been so long since I came to one of these!

336
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,180
You worked hard, Ban Do. You lived well!

337
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,160
You're really skilled at making people laugh.

338
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,290
Hey, let's go here.

339
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,060
Soda drinks, Bang, Beer, Food Coupon, Ice Cream, Bang, 3000 won coupon

340
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,790
That's right!

341
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,670
Look at 'em... Give me a freaking break...

342
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,930
Oh, right. There was always one of these at university.

343
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,330
Do you wanna try it once?

344
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,900
Yeah! You should.

345
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,940
Oh, a date. How lucky.

346
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,750
Your classmates and seniors are trying so hard to earn our membership fee...

347
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,470
We're getting so wet in our youth!

348
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,390
And I can't find the underclassman anywhere and he's on a date?

349
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,450
You punk! You're so lax!

350
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,960
- No, that's not it...
- Oh!

351
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,570
Would you look at that? It's Jin Joo! Are you going to try it?

352
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,920
Yeah.

353
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,300
Great, it'll be ₩500 for one round.

354
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,470
I'll do it for ₩1000.

355
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,470
Let's go.

356
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,680
Instead, I want to hit him.

357
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,400
What are you doing just standing there?

358
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,410
No, no! Excuse me! Hyung!

359
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,410
- Thank you.
- No, that's not it.

360
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,440
One, two...

361
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,440
You, seriously! Hurry up and do it!

362
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,690
Hit the bull's eye!

363
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,880
Hey, Ma Jin Joo, you throw so well!

364
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,480
This is nothing.

365
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,190
Let's change your diaper.

Can't you switch the people?

371
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,060
Are you worried about Ban Do?

372
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,900
Of course!

373
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,780
Ooh... Choi Ban Do...

374
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,710
Wait.

375
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,440
Excuse me, uh.. I think we have to switch people. I think he's going to die.

376
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,560
Who's deciding that? I'm hitting one man only.

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:22,080
♫ Change, change everything ♫

382
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,750
Ma Jin Joo... You're dead.

383
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:37,110
She's strong. So strong. She really hit just one guy. She beat you up.

384
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,090
There's one thing I figured out for sure.

385
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,980
Love always comes with a worry.

386
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:55,130
Min Seo Young... I think she likes you!!

387
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,200
You little punk!! Hey, this is true. Just trust me.

388
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,060
After the fact...

389
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,380
You found out so quickly. Good job! You worked so hard to figure that out.

390
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh, you worked so hard.

391
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,520
What? You knew?

392
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,700
How did you... How could an ignorant and dense guy like you notice such a sensitive thing?

393
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,350
You'll make the ground sink with your sigh.

394
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,930
Let's just go.

395
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:28,290
What's wrong with him? You were happy as a donkey earlier. Did you get dumped in the meantime?

396
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,870
Oh, she didn't kiss you, right?

397
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,160
Don't start. I'm not in the mood.

398
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,690
Ah, yes, sir.

399
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,720
Ban Do, hurry and change into your uniform.

400
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,510
You used to wear the department uniform like it's a school uniform. What's wrong with you these days?

401
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,420
I told you not to do this, you guys.

402
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,310
You guys will be humiliated wearing this uniform and will be known as Bruce Lee nationally.

403
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,870
I'm not doing it, no. I can't.

404
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:58,660
Hey, Ban Do. You really won't regret not being on TV with us?

405
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:05,160
If you're not going to regret it, at least come and take pictures of us!

406
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
Okay, let's go.

407
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,640
Are you guys really going to take that path? Hey!

408
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,100
Don't use the blue water container, at least!

409
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,350
Kang Ho Dong's here!

410
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,010
Kang Ho Dong?

411
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,990
Kang Ho Dong came!!

412
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,110
- Let's go quickly!
- It's Kang Ho Dong!

413
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,180
I'm not going. What would I do by seeing Kang Ho Dong?

414
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,940
Besides Kang Ho Dong, Jae Woo and the others are making an appearance.

415
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,800
Yeah, they're probably just going to act stupid if they do.

416
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,780
You're really not going? We're going, then.

417
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,820
Okay. You can go.

418
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,560
Let's go!

419
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,120
I'll come back after watching Kang Ho Dong. Sorry!

420
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,170
All right.

421
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,060
Hurry up!

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:32,370
It's new. Did you buy it for me? Why?

429
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,940
Just laugh out loud. I'm more offended when you laugh like that.

430
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,060
Yeah, so I told you not to use the blue water container.

431
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,520
I tried to change your fate, and you wouldn't listen to me.

432
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,190
You guys, once this goes on TV, your dark history will begin until you die.

433
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:15,150
Why? It was cute! You did well.

434
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,270
Such pretty lips.

435
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,760
Isn't that Min Seo Young? Why's she wandering around?

436
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,550
Hey! Min Seo Young! Choi Ban Do's here! Choi Ban Do.

437
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,960
Oh, a mosquito.

438
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,610
Good luck.

439
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,620
Sunbae Nam Gil! Where are you coming from?

1999's May Queen Contest

441
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:05,310
The May Queen candidate for Humanities Department isn't here?

442
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,250
No.

443
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,060
Is there something wrong?

444
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,570
The May Queen candidate is a no show.

445
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,360
What? That Chinese Language Department Zhang Ziyi?

446
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,400
Yeah. Ugh, pretty people just...

447
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,520
The rain will end soon, right?

448
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,390
Probably, right?

449
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,810
Did you see it?

450
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,130
Look at this! Jae Woo, how can I go to school like this? It's so embarrassing!

451
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,030
No, it was fun!

452
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,260
Fun? That's BS.

453
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,720
Juvenile prostitution...

454
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,570
How could a young guy's gaze look like that?

455
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,030
That playboy.

456
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,450
What? I mean, yes?

457
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,190
Give me one. I didn't have it earlier.

458
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,130
Are you hungry? Here.

459
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,610
Ma Jin Joo!

460
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:23,170
Why are you so clumsy and have spots on your clothes? Like an ahjumma.

461
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,630
An old woman?

462
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,860
You be good. Don't meddle.

463
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,230
I heard juvenile prostitution is a big issue these days.

464
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,150
Oh-duk ahjussis are all over the place, huh?

465
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,460
Oh-duk ahjussi? What's that?

466
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,430
It exists. A pervert who goes for young ladies.

467
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,630
Oh, really? These days, older women are the problem.

468
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,250
Hostess bars! Women go to places like that and because young guys like them...

469
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,710
they think they got young for real and go crazy.

470
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:17,790
You have to be careful. What appears to the eye is not always true.

471
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,330
- Hey!
- What?

472
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,370
What kind of conversation are you two having right now?

473
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:29,810
What's with juvenile prostitution and hostess bar? Were they this close to begin with?

474
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,820
I know. They became close very rapidly.

475
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,970
We are  not  close!

476
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,790
Forget it. Hurry up and give us your pork fry. I heard your department food stand is the bomb.

477
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,020
We had a hidden cooking genius here.

478
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:46,970
Jin Joo!

479
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,630
Jin Joo, our humanities department can't be the only department without a May Queen.

480
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,380
The student body says you're registered in the preliminary. They'll let you enter.

481
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,590
Just do it!

482
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,240
What? She entered the May Queen preliminary?

483
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,920
She was chosen because she's pretty, but she didn't go to the preliminary.

484
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,820
Jin Joo, do it. You're the prettiest in the humanities department.

485
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,650
Just do it.

486
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,900
Ah, I'm not a May Queen.

487
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,050
I'm not the style to put myself out there just anywhere.

488
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,460
Can anyone be the May Queen?

489
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,320
Don't go out and get humiliated. Don't do it.

490
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,190
That little...

491
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,620
What's with him?

492
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:28,400
Humiliation? You're afraid I'd place first place, right?

493
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,060
What?

494
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,790
That's it! First place. Let's do it. You're doing it, okay?

495
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,180
What?

496
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,330
I.. Even my clothes are like this.

497
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,890
Maybe next time?

498
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,210
What's this? What's with this clothes, Sunbae?

499
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,430
It was in my car.

500
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,890
Car? A girl's clothes?

501
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,850
Yeah. For my younger sister.

502
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,400
Yeah, sure.

503
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,270
This shouldn't be... How could I be the May Queen?

504
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,720
How could you be the May Queen? It'll be a relief if you get last place.

505
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,630
What are you going to do if I get first place?

506
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,580
What? First place? Ha!

507
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,250
Let's go. Let's try it.

508
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,380
Really? Then, I'll prepare accessories in here.

509
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,800
Let's go, let's go. Hurry.

510
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,150
May Queen makeup waiting room

511
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,530
Humanities Department May Queen candidate.

512
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,410
Okay.

513
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,330
I got pissed off because of Choi Ban Do and got myself into this. But what May Queen?

514
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,550
Ugh, I can't do it!

515
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,420
Excuse me..

516
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,220
Please do well. Our History Major's Queen!

517
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,220
- Wait...
- It'd be nice if you place first.

518
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,660
Wait, Sunbae!

519
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,150
You're the fill-in for Humanities, right? History major, class of 99, Ma Jin Joo.

520
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,550
Yes.

521
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,950
- Please get ready fast.
- Okay.

522
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,990
Why is this so short?

523
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,400
May Queen Contest

524
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,250
It's starting!

525
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,950
Nice to meet you, everyone!

526
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,370
You have waited long enough.

527
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:49,410
Great Festival's highlight! We'll begin Hanguk University's May Queen Competition.

528
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,790
We'll begin now. Applause!

529
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,150
We don't even have to see the other contestants. Jin Joo's going to win.

530
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:59,320
Yeah, we don't have to see the others. Jin Joo's going to lose, anyway.

531
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,990
Geez, that scared me. Don't stare like that! It's scary.

532
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,810
How am I scary? Am I scary?

533
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,840
What?

534
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,760
Hanguk University, Queen of May!

535
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,960
What is this? Are you thinking about it right now?

536
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,820
Let's... not just your own major...

537
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,570
I'm joking. Joking! You got scared.

538
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,700
Let's applaud honestly, okay?

539
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,120
- Okay!
- Great.

540
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:33,290
Now, the first candidate, Law Department, Kim Yeong Joo, please come out!

541
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,110
Applause!

542
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,720
Pretty, pretty. So pretty. Say hello.

543
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,010
Great! Next, engineering major, Go Eun Seo!

544
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,990
Oh, nice...

545
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:56,170
Say hello. Thank you. Good.

546
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,320
Should I back out right now?

547
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,490
Should I just go? But, I told them I would do it.

548
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,020
Yes, our last candidate.

549
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,250
Humanities Department, Ma Jin Joo! Applause!

550
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,990
It's Jin Joo!

551
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,500
Applause please, everyone!

552
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,000
So beautiful. Right?

553
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,850
♫  I'm thinking I'm in love. ♫

554
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,250
She's so pretty!

555
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,780
♫ You wake up my heart ♫

556
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,750
Do all women look like that when they put themselves together?

557
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,190
No.

558
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,620
Okay, now with the introductions.

559
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,860
Excuse me?

560
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,360
Introducing yourself.

561
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,940
Ah, yes.

562
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:09,530
Hello. I'm Ma Jin Joo from History major in Humanities.

563
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,730
Ah, you're very nervous.

564
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:18,390
These beautiful women will have a talent show.

565
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:22,780
What will you show us, Jin Joo?

566
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,310
I didn't hear about this.

567
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,030
Isn't that her? The one you're going to seduce?

568
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,710
Yeah. You're right.

569
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,120
Hurry up. You'll lose her.

570
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,120
It's a talent show. So, why not do something you do very well? Anything.

571
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,800
I have this kind of talent (Janggi is stomach in Korean).

572
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,430
I don't have any talent to show off.

573
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,430
I'll give up.

574
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,950
Wait, wait. How can you give up after introducing yourself as a candidate? No way.

575
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,010
You can just choose whatever you're good at.

576
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:02,220
For example, dancing, singing, or doing impersonations.

577
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,190
I don't really have anything I'm good at.

578
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,750
Nothing..

579

582
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,270
That's why our daughters sing unbelievably well.

583
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:28,070
Jin Joo's the best at singing.

584
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,840
She was born with it! Should we have made her become a singer?

585
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,270
A singer?

586
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:40,910
♫ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♫

- What are the things you like?

624
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,980
- The things I like?
- I like ballet, hip hop, and dancing.

625
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,430
You know all of the things I like.

626
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:34,660
But, I don't really know about you.

627
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:42,400
You're right... The things I like...

628
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,030
I don't really have any, so isn't that why you don't know?

629
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,410
How could there be nothing that you like? Think about it deeply.

630
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,050
Things I like...

631
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,300
Drink up!

632
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,000
Liquor!

633
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,500
You thought about it and liquor was all that came out?

634
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,340
Ah, I really don't know.

635
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,510
As expected of you.

636
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,810
What a shame.

637
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,670
I know... Jin Joo was the prettiest.

638
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,210
Aren't you guys just saying this because you're friends with her? She was not the prettiest!

639
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,500
She was the prettiest! Is this a challenge?

640
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:27,430
What challenge? Who challenged you? Let's just say something was wrong with the judge's eyes.

641
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,670
Jae Woo, ugh! How many times has he gone to the bathroom?

642
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,870
Ah... Mister Bo Reum?

643
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:40,730
There's something I'm very curious about. Can I ask you cautiously?

644
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,900
Asking is your freedom. Answering you is also my freedom.

645
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,010
You don't ever let things just pass.

646
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,320
What is it?

647
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,700
The reason you're dating Jae Woo... It's to...

648
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,080
If I ask it like this, I'll probably get hit.

649
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,010
You... Why are you dating Jae Woo?

650
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:03,800
What?

651
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,290
I mean, there has to be reasons for dating someone. Why are you dating him?

652
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,240
Why are you curious about other people's love life?

653
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,740
Why? Tell me. It's not like it costs you something to tell me. Why are you dating him?

654
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,470
Because he's easy.

655
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,400
Ahn Jae Woo. He's easy.

656
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,700
Easy...?

657
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,870
Under construction. Please use Art Department restroom.

658
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,300
How can I go all the way to the art department?

659
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,810
Daebak...

660
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,050
I'm telling you the art major was my style.

661
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,890
- She was pretty.
- Huh?

662
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,300
What do I do?

663
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,600
But not her, but you know the history major from humanities?

664
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,170
She was so cute, she was my style!

665
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,030
Me, too.

666
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,980
Aw, those little punks. They know how to choose the right type of girl.

667
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,510
Hey... Hyeon Seok already called dibs on her at the nightclub.

668
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,930
Alright I called dibs on her. Don't be going after her.

669
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,420
Ah, Director Park? Ha, those little punks.

670
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:32,250
When I get bored after playing with her, I'll give her to you. Just wait.

671
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,120
What? That... those guys... you're all dead.

672
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,590
I'll...

673
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,280
Do they want to die?

674
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,120
Ugh, did I drink too much?

675
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,540
What are you doing?

676
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,040
What are  you  doing?

677
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,830

Oh, I heard Ho Dong came a while ago. Hey, Jin Joo, come out!

683
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,970
Why isn't she coming out?

684
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,200
Does she not want to see it? Ah, just leave her be.

Let's welcome the next guest with a huge applause.

Okay, great. We'll applaud a lot.

Why did you open the door?

717
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,700
If you're a medical student, don't you have something called a Medical Student's Night?

718
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,550
Do you want to go together?

Who are you going to take to the Medical Student's Night?

What the heck? She's gone completely crazy.
