Yerim Pediatric Clinic
Director Park Hyun Seok]/i>

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,570
Oh, Madam. Why are you here without any prior notice?

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,120
Where is Nurse Kim?

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,840
Oh, Honey. Why did you come so suddenly?

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,150
You've arrived, Madam?

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,580
You can leave. Ah, please bring out some hortensia tea that my wife likes so much.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,460
Yes.

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,040
Aiyoo, you came well, Honey.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,130
I was so tired, but we must've communicated telepathically.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,080
Oh! Ah, really?

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,470
Yeah. I was thinking that if I could see your face, then I could live.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,300
How did you come at such a perfect time?

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,140
Ah, I came well.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,780
I missed you, Honey.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,270
You should stay a while before you leave.

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,030
- No, it's okay. Go in now.
- Okay, bye.

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,670
If you are trying to trick someone,

19
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,060
and you get the feeling that the other person is completely tricked,

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,060
there is a big chance that person loves you.

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,740
Please bring out some hortensia tea that my wife likes so much.

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,860
Yes.

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,460
I missed you, Honey.

24
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,810
She was not tricked because she couldn't differentiate between the truth and the lies.

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,890
Instead, it might be because she was pretending not to know so she could love him.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,490
Episode 7: Truth lies in between the truth and the lie.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,970
Seoul, 1999

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,830
♬  How can I dream ♬

29
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,320
♬  about what will be at the end of the world  ♬

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,930
♬  I will be better  ♬

31
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,650

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,740
♬  for me  ♬

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,650
So who're you going to bring to the Medical Students' Night?

34
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,790
We'll see.

35
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,460
Ah, I might get attached. Why do we run into each other so often?

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,890
Whatever, I don't know.

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,030
What are you looking at, you bastard?

38
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,210
What are you guys doing?

39
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,700
What are you doing?

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,950
What?

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,640
Who are you to open the door so?

42
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,510
I asked, what are you?

43
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,450
Me?

44
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,420
I'm... her...

45
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,010
Friend. Yeah, friend.

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,070
What are you?

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,450
What nonsense.

48
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,220
Move. I have to change my clothes.

49
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,570
What? You have to change your clothes? Here? Together?

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,410
Are you crazy? What are you thinking about?

51
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:52,110
Hurry and leave. You're driving me mad.

52
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,610
She's gone properly crazy. Truly insane.

53
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,490
Does she really think she's 20 or what?

54
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,430
Hey.

55
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,480
"Hey"?

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,350
Did you just say "hey" to me?

57
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,670
Ma Jin Joo. You just heard him, right?

58
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,650
You young one who hasn't even come in contact with a dog tag yet...

59
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,670
He said "hey". "Hey".

60
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,650
You've really softened up over the years Choi Ban Do.

61
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,180
Aren't you a freshman? Have you taken the CSAT, oh say, five times?

62
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,910
That's not it.

63
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,300
You know even in poop, I've pooped at least 10 million times more than you have.

64
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,590
You're so dirty.

65
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,630
Don't pay attention to him. Here. Take it.

66
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,590
You should put it back nicely in your car so that your younger sister doesn't find out.

67
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,340
The tag wasn't even cut off.

68
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,660
Nonsense. Younger sister?

69
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,740
Hey. What kind of brother carries his younger sister's clothes in his car?

70
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,000
I see right through you. You bought it for a girl.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,110
You're right.

72
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,450
I bought it for you.

73
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,380
What? Me?

74
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,940
Wear it well. I'm leaving.

75
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,390
What is that expression? Is he laughing at me?

76
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,680
That little punk...

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,310
- Hey.
- What?

78
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,680
You're much littler. Haven't you ever seen a mirror?

79
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,910
Right. Life is so good since you're trying to live a new life with a tall and sexy guy, right?

80
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,870
Wait--

81
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,130
Why are you crying even when you're eating something expensive?

82
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,970
Hm? I bought the most expensive one.

83
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,090
Don't cry now.

84
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,010
Choi Ban Do, this bastard-like bastard.

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,620
Choi Ban Do. You bad bastard. I ought to just! Just!

86
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,990
She truly has a drunk personality. It's one where she talks about others behind their back.

87
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,030
Seol. You should stop drinking.

88
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,380
Hey. I can't not drink this alcohol.

89
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,430
Why? Because our Jin Joo is so pitiful.

90
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,230
You have some sense.

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,910
This?

92
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,550
You know a bit. It's from Italy.

93
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,830
There's not a lot of this model in Korea.

94
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,740
But, girls usually don't know this.

95
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,410
I'm not usual. I probably have more guy things than you.

96
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,720
As expected, Bo Reum has a lot of men.

97
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,930
You're pretty well off, right?

98
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,620
Oh you can tell? I try to hide my upbringing, but you can tell?

99
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,030
Aigoo, I can't compliment you at all.

100
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,070
What? Where'd it go? Where'd my appetizers go?

101
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,600
The appetizers are in your stomach.

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,000
I did? Really?

103
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,270
Did An Jae Woo ditch or what? Why isn't he here?

104
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,930
♬  My love is leaving me.  ♬ (Kim Gun Mo -  Love is Gone)

105
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,070
♬  Again, she left my side. ♬

106
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,280
Why are you dating Ahn Jae Woo?

107
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,500
Because he's easy.

108
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,080
♬  Was I just expecting too much? ♬

109
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,050
Are you crying because of love?

110
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,930
The solution for you who has been crying and laughing because of love.

111
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,500
She did not fall for you. Again, today,

112
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,840
Here with us today to cleanly solve your problems, Bro's Leader,

113
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,980
Lee Sang Min. Please say hello.

114
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,860
Hello, Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Sang Min.

115
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,140
It's the end of May, but you've decided to wear fur?

116
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,740
Yes, since I've been trying to emulate the East Coast style.

117
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,350
- What? Where?
-The East Coast.
- Ah I see.

118
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,410
You look hot. It's a headache whether you're in or out of love.

119
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,490
I wonder who today's caller is. Let me connect. Hello?

120
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,580
Hello, I'm Tinkerbell from Seoul.

121
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,850
Oh, you're a fairy, Tinkerbell.

122
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,570
So shall we have a listen to what your concern is?

123
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:45,070
There's someone that I'm meeting. That person really likes physical intimacy.

124
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,350
Every time we meet we kiss,

125
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,850
touch, and kiss again.

126
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,110
I feel like oh maybe it's for that intimacy that we're meeting.

127
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,000
But you know a kiss is something that's shared because you like each other.

128
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,290
But does the person touch a particular place? That's important.

129
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,500
Mostly my buttocks.

130
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,260
Your behind? That's quite deep. So your bottom is being touched, I see.

131
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,960
How about talking it about it with your significant other? I'm sure that's not the reason why...

132
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,670
I did ask! That person's going out with me because I'm easy.

133
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,750
How can that person say that outright?

134
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,350
It wasn't said to me, directly per se.

135
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,910
So if we are to summarize, your significant other, Tinkerbell

136
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,210
touches you everyday on your behind.

137
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,270
And the reason that you guys are together is because you're easy. Is that correct?

138
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,650
Yes.

139
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,710
This is a bit much. I would almost hope you broke up immediately.

140
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,040
Wait. No, this isn't it.

141
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,920
It's a dangerous world right now. That boy's a jerk.

142
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,430
He said that so directly. The times have changed.

143
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,730
Even if he might seem charming now, this might end up being a huge problem in the future.

144
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,170
Does that person also like to drink?

145
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,750
How did you know?

146
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,980
That's the way it is. I like girls, no women.

147
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,700
They like everyone. They're like that.

148
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,600
Right. He's probably meeting a lot of girls.

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
Tinker Bell, you might also be one of them.

150
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
No way.

151
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,890
I'm an expert in that field, so just trust me. Break up with him.

152
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,990
Miss Tinker Bell, good luck!

153
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,580
Miss? I'm a mister.

154
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,510
Hello?

155
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,680
But, how could he say that outright to his girlfriend?

156
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,620
Hyung, I'm worried about you. As it is, you're old and live alone.

157
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,670
You have to marry someone quickly to have a kid. It's not like you're Superman.

158
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,900
I assure you, I will marry before you do.

159
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,110
- You?
- Of course.
- Want to bet?

160
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,750
Fine, deal. But I won't count it if you get married and then divorce.

161
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,150
- I think you have to count that.
- Why?

162
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,710
Once someone marries, you don't know what'll happen in the future. The beginning is the most important.

163
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,740
- The end result isn't important.
- You're talking like someone who has had a lot of experience. Fine, fine.

164
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,180
Anyway, Miss Tinker Bell can't meet a boy like that.

165
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,770
[Oppa ♥]

166
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,780
Oh, hi.

167
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,670
Next week?

168
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,690
Okay, let's meet up.

169
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,720
Hi, I'm Park Hyeon Seok, the medical major you saw at the nightclub.

170
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,780
Are you free today?

171
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,620
Let's meet again.

172
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,490
It seems like you're just happy and excited because a boy gave you his number.

173
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,240
Director Park is just playing with a girl like you.

174
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,650
I called dibs on her. Don't get involved.

175
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,050
I'll hand her over when I get bored with her. Just wait.

176
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,670
Other people ponder whether or not they should go to that concours once in a year.

177
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,410
This is already my third time this year, Mom.

178
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,230
I can also have a slump.

179
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,230
How can I always think about ballet and not rest?

180
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm exhausted!

181
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,740
It's not easy to live as a kid or as an adult.

182
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,010
Right?

183
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,910
Did you hear me?

184
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,680
Just leave your house.

185
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,250
"I'm going to to leave with the wind." And you just run away from home. How's that?

186
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,990
What? Am I a high schooler? I'm not a kid, why would I run away from home?

187
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,230
You are a kid. You still have to grow a lot.

188
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,260
Now you're smiling. I just said it for you to smile, that's all.

189
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,810
Yeah, thanks to you, I'm smiling.

190
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,130
Hold on.

191
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,980
Hello?

192
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,000
Hey, where are you?

193
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,380
Ma Jin Joo?

194
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,640
Where are you? Hey, who really is this Park Hyeon Seok boy?

195
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Did he do something to you?

196
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,990
Where are you? Stay where you are. I'll be right there.

197
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,910
Something urgent came up. I'll be going now.

198
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,410
What? Oh. Okay.

199
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,990
Where are you?

200
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,840
You're really not going?

201
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,110
- What?
- Medical Student's Night.

202
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,990
You're supposed to introduce your girlfriend there. I've noticed you don't go every year.

203
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,270
I have to study. Instead of showing our relationship to others,

204
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,710
I should graduate quickly. I want to be more fitting for your household.

205
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,420
How could I take you there? Have you not seen yourself in the mirror?

206
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,990
Don't be cautious of my household.

207
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,740
It only matters if I like you or not. Would my dad need a doctor as his son-in-law?

208
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,950
I need your dad.

209
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,700
I think I'll have to ask my dad to buy another car.

210
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,180
It's hard to go from place to place while having to study. It'll be tiring.

211
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,890
Don't do that.

212
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:30,300
I'm already selfish for accepting that free room from you, if you continue to do this, I can't date you.

213
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Do you think I'm dating you because I want a car?

214
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,870
How are you try to compensate me with a car.

215
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,780
You're too nice...

216
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,100
That trash-like bastard.

217
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,200
So, he got a hospital after seducing a rich woman,

218
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
and then he played around and cheated?

219
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,020
Played around?

220
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,450
- Hey, you should be careful of what you say with that face.
- Did I say something wrong?

221
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,920
Anyway, that future wife is his girlfriend now. Then what about his advances towards me?

222
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,950
If I get bored with her, I'll give her to you. Just wait.

223
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,450
- Am I second?
- Then would you be the first?

224
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,360
He approached you just so he could play with you one time.

225
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,730
He has so many more of those kinds of girls. That's why I told you not to get involved with him.

226
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,310
But how do you know this in so much detail? You only had a work relationship with him.

227
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,400
Well ... just ...

228
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,310
Perhaps... were you his errand boy?

229
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,330
Err-- Errand boy? Your words a bit harsh. What are you talking about?

230
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:45,900
Work relationships are usually like that. Take care of the client's personal matters so that he will--

231
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,190
You really did all sorts of things.

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,210
All sorts of them.

233
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,250
- Did you eat?
- No.

234
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,220
- You went this long without eating?
- I was busy.

235
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,410
Yes, Director. Three boxes by next morning?

236
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,350
Yes, sir. Have a good night!

237
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,380
What?

238
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,010
How much did I drink last night?

239
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,780
That bastard.

240
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,500
Hey. Hey. You left those two scary girls

241
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,820
alone with me! You ran away? Get up.

242
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,560
Wake up!

243
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,590
Turn around. Oh, geez!

244
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,170
A frozen corpse, a deep sea fish, what are you?

245
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,720
Appetizers.

246
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,030
I have to cut it up to eat it.

247
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,760
You can't have beef jerky in his house, really.

248
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,740
Cheon Seol!!

249
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,040
What is this? Gloves? Oh, no! Who did this?

250
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,090
Who? Do you not remember? Wow, she's saying she doesn't remember!

251
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,130
But where else can I resolve this unfairness?

252
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,450
Oh no. Yesterday.

253
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,890
Yeah, that's right. After you were drunk yesterday, you...

254
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,350
Look, Cheon Seol.

255
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,920
I'm not saying I'm going to do anything to you. But, when you get drunk...

256
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,970
Yeah, you have bad drinking habits too. You can fix those.

257
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,970
Good luck.

258
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,610
Hey, where are you going?

259
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,600
This is your drinking habit!

260
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,110
She knows. She knows and she's acting like that.

261
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,630
I'm the victim, I'm the victim!

262
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,130
I'm crazy!

263
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,240
That must've been really expensive.

264
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,150
Sorry, Dok Jae. I'll pay you back for sure in the future.

265
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,550
You're doing what? Revenge?

266
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,470
What, for me?

267
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,790
Never mind, I already got revenge on him.

268
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,470
I've already gotten a bit of revenge for your sake, too.

269
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,500
What?

270
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,530
Oh, I'm sorry. Please have some of this.

271
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,200
Oh, I thought you were my friend.

272
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,350
That is so like you. Petty revenge. You should punish him properly!

273
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,200
Only you don't have to get involved. Why would I go to such extents?

274
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,310
Also, even a minute and second of youth are so precious. Do you really have the time to waste all of it on him?

275
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,470
Don't you have feelings? You were so mistreated, don't you feel wronged?

276
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,560
Why are you like this suddenly? Are you like this because you're upset about how that guy mistreated me?

277
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,000
Right? That's why you want revenge, right?

278
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,250
Do you think that's the only reason?

279
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,090
He put a leash on a girl and led her on.

280
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,450
He hurt a girl's heart by cheating on her.

281
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,710
And, he saw me as a second. He deserves karma.

282
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,570
Okay. What do you want to do?

283
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,980
You looked down on me because I kept watching those melodrama like dramas, right?

284
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,440
I will show what a real melodrama plot is like.

285
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,960
Yes, I'll see you in the afternoon.

If you want to bite the tail of a rat-like bastard, you have to find a way into the rat's hole first.

287

- But, there's something you have to do before that.
- Let's just not get involved, okay?

You can't go into a rat's hole with nothing. You have to bring what the rat likes.

- Heard what?

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,560
- The granddaughter of Samsung Group attends our school.
- Samsung Group?

296
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,620
Hey, don't lie. Why would that rich person come to our school?

297
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,110
I'm telling the truth. She must be attending this school secretly to help out the company.

Who is it? Is it someone you know?

- I'll have one cup of espresso.

That should be really bitter.

Oh, I see. You travel to other countries a lot.

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,910
You bastard, you'll be leaving your house to cheat on your wife.

314
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,290
I wanted to contact you sooner but pre-med has a lot of homework.

315
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,310
Oh, if you're a medical student, there's something called a Medical Student's Night, right?

316
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,230
Yeah. How did you know?

317
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,090
My friend's boyfriend is a medical student. She was bragging about how she was going there.

318
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,440
Do you want to go together?

319
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,270
Really?

320
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,630
Ah, no. You have a girlfriend. How could I go?

321
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,920
I heard from other people. That Kim Ye Rim is your girlfriend.

322
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Darn, where did she hear this from?

323
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:37,610
No, she's not my girlfriend. We dated briefly in the past, but she kept following me around, so.

324
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,450
Well, you never know.

325
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,800
Anyway, since there's someone you have unfinished business with, I don't think I should go.

326
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,720
No, it'll be finished soon. Actually, it's already finished.

327
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,820
Don't worry about it.

328
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:00,670
Oh, Ma Jin Joo. You're going to get rid of his wife with your own hands I see.

329
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,500
I will cut off his tail.

330
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,630
What did you say right now?

331
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,720
I,

332
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,920
I really like you.

333
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,890
As it is he is sewage. He's done so much hard work.

334
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,780
Will that smart kid abandon her?

335
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,660
Naturally if there is anything fishy, it's going to sting more.

336
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,100
Whatever the gift, we should be on the offensive. We aim for the head, not the tail.

337
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,960
So, you're really going to Medical Student's Night with him?

338
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,270
As for any affairs that happen in the world, what must you catch?

339
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,190
I know this. The scene of the crime.

340
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,700
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

341
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,420
- Have you not seen Ahn Jae Woo?
- He didn't come today.

342
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,730
What is this? He hasn't even been answering my calls.

343
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,170
Did you drop something? Money? Do you want me to look for it with you?

344
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,130
No.

345
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,880
- Let's go.
- Where?

346
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,290
- Let's drink.
- No, but I don't really feel like drinking.

347
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,670
Just ask her directly.

348
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,280
Are you reciting a Buddhist chant? What is it? You're bumping your nose on the beer.

349
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,100
You have something worrying you, right? Tell me, this noona will listen.

350
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,560
Hey....

351
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,580
Hold on, I have to use the restroom.

352
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,320
Wait a little bit.

353
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,830
Yeah. Just let her know directly.

354
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,170
I won't know the truth until I hear it directly from her.

355
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,440
We're going on vacation next month, You know, right?

356
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,740
They're probably meeting a lot of people.

357
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,930
Tinker Bell, you might be one of them.

358
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,060
First one...
(Speed Dial 1: [Oppa ♥] Calling...)

359
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,370
Oppa?

360
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,540
Tinker Bell, you might be one of them.

361
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,430

364
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,510
You're one of those people, you idiot!

365
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
Sorry.

366
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,040
What's wrong? Are you crying?

367
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,780
Hey, which number boyfriend am I?

368
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,890
What are you saying? What's wrong?

369
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,650
Am I saved as your 200th Boyfriend?

370
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,260
What?

371
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,110
Ahn Jae Woo!

372
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,660
Also, am I a math problem? Why am I easy?

373
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,350
I am really really complicated!!

374
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,190
Oh, also, if something happens before the vacation, let me know. My little baby.

375
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,610
What is this? No way.

376
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,590
Did he see this?

377
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,610

I'll go with him, stick right by him and totally act like his girlfriend. So make sure to bring her to the scene.

380
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,880
Everything will end once she sees him at the scene of the crime with her own two eyes.

00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,940
Why do you keep intervening?

Yes?

Hi. Director Park...

390
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,710
Park Hyeon Seok wanted me to bring you somewhere.

391
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,900
Oh, really?

392
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,070
Oh, but, he said his phone was broken.

393
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,140
He wanted me to take you to Medical Student's Night.

394
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,230
Really? He said he wasn't going, but.

395
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,040
He had to attend suddenly. His sunbae asked him to.

396
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,190
Okay, let's go.

397
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,460
Let's go!

398
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,640
Hangook University's 19th Medical Student's Night

399
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,620
Hello.

400
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,500
Wow, look at this place.

401
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,310
Wow, what a big event.

402
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,600
All the professors are here, too.

403
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,770
Oh, look.

404
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,640
Is it wonderful?

405
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,510
Yes, of course.

406
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,760
This is your grave today.

407
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,640
Should we go in?

408
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,410
Wait a second. Let's go talk.

409
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,070
What?

410
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,170
Wait, hold up. You don't have anything like a weak heart, right?

411
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,140
What?

412
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,920
No, no. Let's go.

413
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,060
Should I have bought Cheongsimhwan? ( An herbal remedy to calm you.

414
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,750
Oh, are you not going in?

415
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,780
- Do you want to?
- What?

416
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,270
Of course I do, we agreed to go.

417
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,120
What are you? Why are you approaching me?

418
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,150
I don't know what you're talking about. You contacted me first.

419
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,310
At first, yeah.

420
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,800
Do you know the granddaughter of Samsung Group, by any chance?

421
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,280
They don't have a granddaughter. Only grandsons.

422
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,090
They came from the same preschool as me, so I know very well.

423
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,670
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

424
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,360
But why? Is it someone you know?

425
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,440
No, I was just wondering.

426
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,570
It seems someone's playing a trick on me.

427
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,980
Who? Who's doing that to you?

428
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,200
Samsung Group doesn't have a granddaughter. Are you a boy?

429
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,350
Do I have to check?

430
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,550
Samsung Group? Who said I'm the granddaughter?

431
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,410
Your friend.

432
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,740
I was pushed into the pool a while ago because of him.

433
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:30,310
I thought about it, and I realized that I'd talked about you before.

434
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,710
What are you two?

435
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,730
I think you were misinformed. It's not me. Oh, my!

436
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,490
What are you two?

437
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,780
How did you know I'm dating Kim Ye Rim?

438
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,230
Even if you look like this, I can hit women.

439
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,310
- What are you!
- Park Hyeon Seok!

440
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,170
You.

441
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,380
Why are you guys here?

442
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,630
Gather all of Park Hyeon Seok's seconds?

443
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,400
Yeah. You said he has a lot of girls.

444
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,000
If we're going to catch him in the act, we shouldn't leave any holes where he can escape through.

445
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,460
I don't want to leave you.

446
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,250
You have to leave?

447
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,600
Okay. Call me again.

448
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,260
That bastard.

449
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,850
You were hiding here?

450
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,530
I looked for you for a long time.

451
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,040
This rat-like bastard.

452
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,470
Let's have a talk.

453
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,800
Where are you running away?

454
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,910
With that innocent face. It's not even two-timing, but three-timing?

455
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,670
I guess medical students have a lot of free time.

456
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,270
You were meeting three girls at once.

457
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,480
You slyly smile in front of people.

458
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,260
And then you play around with this girl and that girl behind their backs?

459
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,430
No, it's a misunderstanding.

460
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,910
Misunderstanding? The three victims are here, but it's a misunderstanding?

461
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,440
What is this?

462
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,100
No, no.

463
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,480
This isn't true. Okay?

464
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,440
Why is he living like that?

465
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,530
It's a misunderstanding.

466
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,770
This really isn't true!

467
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,800
It seems true.

468
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,310
Ye Rim.

469
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,760
What kind of guy...

470
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,950
Ah. Nice timing.

471
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,760
Mop up Operation Rat Bastard Park Hyeon Seok

00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,300
Rat Bastard Park Hyeon Seok/First Victim Kim Ye Rim

473
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,050
Victim2 YeongHwa Gwan/ Victim 3 Coffeeshop

474
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,990
Ratcatcher Ma Jin Joo /Medical Night

475
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,230
The scene is there where he is caught and buried in a trap he can't escape from.

476
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,820
Wow, this is detailed.

477
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,880
This operation was designed from just a drama, right?

478
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,330
Then, don't put Korean drama down. Aren't they better than detective agencies?

479
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,340
Agreed.

480
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,030
This is a misunderstanding.

481
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,520
You have another girl? Four-timing?

482
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,700
The more we peel, the more layers there are. Are you an onion?

483
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,660
No, no, this really isn't true.

484
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,790
Don't listen to them. I was just playing with them.

485
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,970
You're my only one.

486
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,700
Bastard.

487
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,150
Ye Rim.

488
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,180
What are you?

489
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,830
Me?

490
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,710
Is this all because of you two? What are you guys?

491
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,100
I'm Ye Rim's boyfriend.

492
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,270
Honey. Is this the guy you were playing around with?

493
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,670
What?

494
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,700
He's not much.

495
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,870
Yeah...
♬  the cool wind which brushes me ♬

496
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:08,070
Yeah.
♬ gives me a moment of respite. Oh yeah. ♬

497
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:13,150
Hey.
♬  Breathing within me beyond the hill ♬

498
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,880
I think you're misunderstanding something. Don't get involved with these kinds of people.

499
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,540
These kinds of people are with you for your money, you idiot.

500
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,210
Because you're rich!

501
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,600
Why would people like him date you?

502
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,790
That's you.

503
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,240
The level of talking is really declining.

504
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,370
What did you say?

505
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,390
Are you not going to let go?

506
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,110
Where are you putting those hands?

507
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,890
♬  If I can give it to you  ♬

508
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:44,010
♬ If it feels like every day has no meaning ♬

509
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,090
♬  Now it's the start  ♬

510
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,370
♬  Find your dream, hey, hey, hey! ♬

511
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,260
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

512
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,450
That guy isn't worth crying over.

513
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,570
Just leave her.

514
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,770
Yeah, just cry a lot today and forget about him.

515
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,990
If today hadn't happened, you would've married him and cried forever.

516
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,000
How do I know? I saw it all.

517
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,550
Through life I've noticed that this world is large and there are many boys.

518
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:28,690
Women should meet a good guy for life.Not a successful guy but a good one.

519
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,770
Even though there are boys like me who aren't any of those.

520
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,130
Yeah, just cry now and brush it all off.

521
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,810
Even though you feel like dying now,

522
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:53,600
you have more days to live than the amount of days you've lived so far.

523
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,590
What are you guys?

524
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,730
I'm older than you guys!

525
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,130
That's true.

526
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,740
- That's right.
- Here.

527
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,070
You should rest well when you get home.

528
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,280
Don't cry.

529
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,770
Oh, and...

530
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,530
I knew he was meeting other girls.

531
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,100
I didn't know there would be that many, but.

532
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:34,050
I was scared to break up with him. So, I just cried every day.

533
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,430
I feel better now that it ended up this way.

534
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,970
Thank you for hitting him for me.

535
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,630
You're coming now, Student? I heard you were moving out.

536
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,140
Pardon? No, I'm not moving out.

537
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,830
That can't be. The female student who rented this place called

538
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,990
and asked for her security deposit back since she was moving out. Didn't you know?

539
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,570
I'll take care of the contract by this week.

540
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,870
Move out, okay? I'm going.

541
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,870
Excuse me. Ahjumma!

542
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,390
She's playing with me?

543
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,420
I wanted to

544
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,400
Aigoo, my stomach.

545
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,000
You, really, that's like attempted murder!

546
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,000
Where did you learn how to kick that place?

547
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,510
From Bo Reum.

548
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:13,370
Yoon Boo Ruem Aerobics? You went there to learn that? So you can beat me?

549
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,970
I didn't learn it to beat you up.

550
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,560
Yoon Bo Reum only teaches people how to hit their husband.

551
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,860
Like these kicks.

552
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,730
You girls are really scary.

553
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,990
I made use of it like this. I should give her an award.

554
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,570
You don't think he's dead, do you?

555
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,730
Oh, he didn't die, but he must've met his ancestors briefly for sure.

556
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,930
That's attempted murder. You Ahjumma with no fear.

557
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,470
You're calling me an Ahjumma again. I should just--

558
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,240
What happened here?

559
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,140
When Director Park pushed me earlier, I think I got a scratch.

560
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,810
This bastard.. I ought to just--

561
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,380
Why would you do such a dangerous--

562
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,130
I told you he isn't an ordinary guy.

563
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,380
So why are you interfering and following me there and what are you doing now?

564
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,700
Why are you saying that over this? You're not even a kid.

565
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,470
Really....

566
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,680
Why are you upset when I am the one who's hurt.

567
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,860
I am not upset.

568
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,210
Do you act like this to Min Seo Young?

569
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,830
Just to me, right?

570
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,730
Let me see.

571
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:41,800
♬  You aren't paying attention or listening  ♬

572
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:49,540
♬  Without meaning to your heart is passing by ♬

573
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,540
♬  If I had held you then as you were ♬

574
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,070
Are you feeling better?

575
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,160
About what?

576
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,710
Director Park.

577
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,260
♬  Have we stayed the same? ♬

578
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,420
I heard he even forces you to manage his affairs. You shouldn't let him bully you.

579
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:11,440
Are you an idiot. Why would you endure that, you're not that amazing.

580
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,330
♬  Understand my coldness  ♬

581
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:19,200
To live and eat everybody does it. It wasn't only me living that way.

582
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,220
During business you see all kinds this guy and that guy doing this.

583
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,330
♬  I'm on my way to find you  ♬

584
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,270
You know what I like?

585
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,920
Someone asked me. Suddenly I had no answer and I couldn't think of anything.

586
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,830
- Is there nothing that I like?
- Chicken soup.

587
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,090
Chicken soup. Ah, right.

588
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,270
I like chicken soup the most, that's right.

589
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,360
Tangerines. UFC. Collecting DVDs.

590
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:57,500
DVD, right. I was a movie mania.

591
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,770
Knowing that why did you throw all my DVDs after we got married?

592
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,930
What about you?

593
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,910
Did you sell all my jewels after our honeymoon because you thought I hated them?

594
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:15,800
That's because of our financial situation. We were stuck.

595
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,680
♬  That touch was wonderful. ♬

596
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,480
Is knowing what you like really that important?

597
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,400
It's a busy life just trying to live and eat.

598
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:34,920
- That's true.
- ♬  My hidden heart is now ♬

599
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,860
♬  Calling you. ♬

600
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:49,340
♬ Within the time that stopped, ♬

601
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:56,290
♬ I'm trying to find my way towards you. ♬

602
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:04,040
♬  I can't hide this longing in the end  ♬

603
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,170
♬ Come to me just as you are  ♬

604
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:19,380
♬  Our world has found us again. ♬

605
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,270
♬ Like the beginning, I will go towards you. ♬

606
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:36,380
♬  If I can go back in time ♬

607
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:43,440
♬ Even if I live again, it's always going to be you. ♬

608
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:51,250
♬  Like fate that never changes, I will ♬

609
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:57,450
♬ Always be by your side to protect you  ♬

610
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,380
♬  By your side. ♬

611
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,440
It's late.Let's go.

612
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,970
Okay.
♬  I'll always protect you  ♬

613
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:17,410
What kind of 20 year old goes travelling? With a man. So adept at it.

614
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,660
That wench.

615
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,010
What about you?

616
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,880
There were about... One,

617
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,670
Four people? Four people including you?

618
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:34,430
Including me... five people.

619
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,330
Five?!

620
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:38,690
There could be more.

621
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:42,870
What!? Wow, is that her talent?

622
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,750
And... She's the one that's easy. How am I easy?

623
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:51,260
You know that too. It's my first time dating!

624
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,430
But what about me... what is so easy?

625
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:57,110
W-Wait.

626
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,550
Did you hear us talking that time?

627
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:05,770
Yeah, I heard it all. I heard it all. She dated me because I'm easy.

628
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,720
What she meant was...

629
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,680
Don't talk about Yoon Bo Reum! Don't tell me I'm easy! Just don't talk at all...

630
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,120
Why are you whining at me?

631
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:21,600
I won't, I won't. Whatever, I don't know. I won't know forever. I won't know until I die.

632
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,730
If you like her, then that's what matters.

633
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,300
The remaining four people? Just toss them all out.

634
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,580
"Yoon Bo Reum is my girl." Get in there and steal her.

635
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,810
Just like that.

636
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,690
What is that?

637
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,740
Is that one of the four people?

638
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,130
If you had something to tell me, you could've called. How could you come find me all the way here?

639
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,110
That's what I'm saying. Why are you avoiding me?

640
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,930
We agreed to go on a trip together.

641
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:05,530
Perhaps, do you.. have a man?

642
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,940
No! Aish, really.

643
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,000
Where would I have a man?

644
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,470
Hey, why? You're gonna leave? Aren't you gonna watch some more?

645
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,240
It's interesting.

646
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,590
Ah.

647
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:24,990
- Don't do that.
- What's the matter?

648
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,670
Won't you take back that dirty hand?!

649
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:41,500
Ahn Jae Woo!

650
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,140
Hey, you bonehead. Can't you grasp the situation? Look at your opponent.

651
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,590
What is this image?

652
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:53,750
What is this? I asked, what is this?

653
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,200
Don't do it.

654
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,130
Hey, Ahn Jae Woo. Leave. Hurry up.

655
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,110
What, you rascal? What?

656
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,160
I'm... I'm her...

657
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,960
I'm her boyfriend, why?!

658
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,350
- What?
- Who? Is it you?

659
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,460
It's pretty late. Are you really going to go alone?

660
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,420
Well, my thoughts are complicated anyway, so I'll think while walking.

661
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,240
Who would take an ahjumma away?

662
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,620
Well, you're right. Your face makes you look like you're 20, but once they grab you, they'll be too scared to take you away.

663
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,850
Bye.

664
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,160
Wait, Jin Joo.

665
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,930
I saw the May Queen contest. It was nice.

666
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:25,950
I remember that I used to like it when you sang. I forgot.

667
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,340
What is this? this unexpected talk...

668
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:41,370
If I talk nicely, can't you just take it nicely.

669
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,680
You're changing the subject.

670
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,520
I spoke in vain.

671
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,450
I wonder if she got back okay.

672
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:57,650
What the heck? Who is she calling at this time?

673
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,020
Answer your phone, you punk.

674
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,770
Yes, hello?

675
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,970
Where are you?

676
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,040
You can't see anything in front of you, can you?

677
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,750
I can't see either.

678
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,190
What are you doing right now? Leave before I scream.

679
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,780
Scream. Scream to your heart's content.

680
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,540
I said, scream!

681
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,520
It's all ruined anyway. You.

682
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:52,200
Do you know how much I had to suffer by staying by that ugly Kim Ye Rim's side?

683
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,170
I didn't know that, but I do know that you're a pitiful excuse for a human being.

684
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:01,300
Does your mother know that you do these things?

685
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:08,760
Are you a teacher? Have you lost your mind?

686
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:17,110
I told you. I can beat up women.

687
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,270
I'll hit you, and then go to prison.

688
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,740
I said I'll go to prison!

689
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:39,250
Kim Ye Rim knew that Director Park was cheating. What a twist.

690
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,300
How much do you think she liked him that she kept that all in and even married him?

691
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,370
He lost that kind of girl. Aiyoo, what a pitiful bastard.

692
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,490
Were we seeing too much from one view?

693
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:56,300
A love that hurts too much isn't love.

694
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,020
That isn't love, it's violence.

695
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,530
It's the strongest, and the worst kind of violence.

696
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:11,060
Even through an affair blossoms, later it becomes dull and tiresome.

697
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,770
How does that make sense?

698
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,180
If that bastard cheats on her with a hundred people,

699
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,960
then that woman will remember the names of every one of those people.

700
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,090
Like the blade of a knife, it should not become dull.

701
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:31,140
The belief which I have lived with until now, affection, my values would hit rock bottom.

702
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,680
Bad bastard.

703
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,940
Why?

704
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:49,770
You said that for me to hear, right? I didn't cheat that time.

How can you do this to me? How?!

716
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,470
Let's get a divorce.

717

What?

718
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:47,510
We're too unhappy. I'm so unhappy!

719

722
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:08,880
I could barely finde the truth somewhere between truth and falsehood.

Go Back Couple Preview

726
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,040
Seol has disappeared.

727
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,440
Do I have to report this to the police?

728
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,510
She's very strange these days.

729
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,510
- Go Dok, where are you going?
- To study!

730
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:42,130
The fact that you kept that for 18 years means you were that much concerned about her. That Cheon Seol.

731
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,180
You seem like an adult.

732
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,080
You changed too much in a span of a few weeks.

733
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,840
I don't like men who make my daughter cry.

734
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,140
What does that...

735
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,690
Tell me truthfully. Who is Seo Jin?
