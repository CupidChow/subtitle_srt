1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,250
Yeah, the president we had for our major during freshman year.
 2017

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,980
He gave us a lot of disciplinary punishments.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,090
Why would that Hyung come find you?

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,820
Is he trying to sell you insurance?

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,360
No way. He used to run around and say that he was going to be an architect.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,380
He must've become something at least.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,740
Hey, hey. I'm here.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,170
I'll call you later.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,460
Hyung.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,040
What did I tell you?

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,220
When someone suddenly contacts you,

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,330
that's 100% going to be for selling insurance or multi-level distributorship.

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,680
Who could've predicted that he would turn out like that?

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,440
Hey, he used to be ridiculous and say that he was going to be an architect.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,230
That's right. He bragged so much.

16
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,330
Everyone's the same.

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,230
Did we never do that? We used to brag so much about becoming movie directors.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,070
Don't you remember?

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,900
Aigoo.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,000
I asked around a lot and managed to get you staff positions. Don't make mistakes.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,550
- Yes, Sunbaenim!
- Yes, Sunbaenim!

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,900
- We will do our best!
- We'll do well!

23
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,750
We'll work as if our lives depended on it!

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,470
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

25
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,500
Hello, managers. Take some water.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,420
Sir, here is your water.

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,400
Take some refreshing water.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,870
Put that there.

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,500
Hey, hey. This is confusing, clean this up!

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,800
I'll do it! I will!

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,180
Take that back there.

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,860
There was a time like that.

33
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,670
A time where we didn't have anything, so there was nothing to lose.

34
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,060
A time when shining eyes and many earnest dreams

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,100
were a powerful weapon against the world.

36
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,190
Be strong, you punk.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,790
I wish ₩100,000,000 fell from the sky. (T/N: $89,523)

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,080
What can you do with just ₩100,000,000. (T/N: $89,523)

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,410
We couldn't estimate how strong this world was.

40
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,270
There was a time like that.

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:28,090
Episode 8: Your Only Weapon to Stand Up to the World

42
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,730
How will Park Hyeon Seok come to school now?
Seoul, 1999

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,050
He tried to play with some girls, and drowned himself.

44
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,240
She was one of the candidates for the May Queen, right? History major Ma Jin Joo.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,930
With his personality, do you think he'll leave that girl alone?

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,270
I saw earlier that he left with his eyes flipped. He was furious. What if he causes trouble?

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,240
Hey, no way.

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,420
Ahem.

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,310
Did she get back okay?

50
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,340
Answer the phone.

51
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,290
What the heck?

52
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,460
Who is she calling at this time?

53
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,780
Yes, hello?

54
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,070
Where are you?

55
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,000
You can't see anything, can you?

56
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,920
I can't see anything.

57
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,100
What are you doing right now? Leave before I scream.

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,600
Scream. Scream to your heart's content.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,430
I said, scream!

60
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,830
Everything's all ruined. Do you know how much I suffered

61
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,430
while staying by ugly Kim Ye Rim's side?

62
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,140
I don't know about that, but

63
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,130
I do know that you're a pitiful excuse for a human being.

64
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,750
I told you, right?

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,320
I can hit women.

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,440
I'll hit you, and go to prison.

67
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,260
I said I'll go to prison!

68
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,990
Why would you go to prison?

69
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,280
I'll send you Up There.

70
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,580
What the heck? Where did she go?

71
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,410
Seriously.

72
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,540
Hi.

73
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,250
You really left home?

74
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,990
You're amazing.

75
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,670
Heh.

76
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,080
Why won't you answer your phone?

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,840
What are you? You bastards, you!

78
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,500
If you really want to leave the world, keep on doing what you're doing.

79
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,680
That's enough. Stop.

80
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,000
That's enough. He's someone else's precious child.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,590
Aiyoo, what good is it beating him up?

82
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,330
Why are you guys like this to me, really?!

83
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,740
It's because you're pathetic. Because you're pathetic.

84
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,170
You're tricking and acting in front of a girl you don't even like.

85
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,350
You're wasting such good time. Your youth is so pathetic.

86
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,450
Just know that it's a relief that this person came.

87
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,130
Otherwise you would've been dead because of me.

88
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,150
This bastard... only learning bad things.

89
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,770
Leave.

90
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,370
And, don't live your life like that.

91
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,240
Harassing a weak salesman.

92
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm scared that my child will turn out like that.

93
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,350
Why aren't you coming?

94
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,770
What?

95
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,320
I thought I was going to die. My heart dropped.

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,870
Why are kids so scary?

97
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,340
If it wasn't for you, something bad would've happened.

98
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,650
What the heck? You pretended to be strong just a while ago.

99
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,960
I can't be wishy-washy. I have to set the boundaries straight so that he doesn't bother me again.

100
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,860
Anyway, thank you.

101
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,340
But why are you here? It's my neighborhood.

102
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,640
I'm on a walk. The night air is good.

103
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,670
A walk? In this neighborhood? All the way out here?

104
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,910
Yeah. This neighborhood is perfect for walking.

105
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,430
Why?

106
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,710
Excuse me... I'm asking this just in case, but...

107
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,360
Do you really like me?

108
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,910
I've heard this before.

109
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,050
I told you last time. I think that I like you.

110
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,870
Since when?

111
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,360
You told me that you didn't like me when you asked me to date you.

112
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,100
It wasn't then.

113
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,990
It was after that.

114
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,660
So it's after I arrived here.

115
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,770
It's a mature style.

116
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,470
As expected, guys in their twenties like a lot of older women.

117
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,750
I like you. You.

118
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,100
What are you talking about?

119
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,170
There's something like that.

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,610
But... It'd be better not to like me.

121
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,530
Why?

122
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,210
Of course, I'm young and pretty now.

123
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,480
But in this body, there could be a mom.

124
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,430
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,030
♬  I'll approach you slowly  ♬

126
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,020
Perhaps...

127
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,790
Do you have a ghost following you? A mother ghost?

128
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,760
Aish, really.

129
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,900
Just... More than me...

130
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,190
How about chasing your dream?

131
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,540
The top star in the history of Korea.

132
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,890
How did you know my dream?

133
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,440
Huh?

134
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,290
Your physiognormy.

135
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,050
Your physiognomy is exactly that of a leader.

136
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,360
You can earn 60 trillion.

137
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,090
You can't pretend not to know me then. Okay?

138
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,700
What are you saying?

139
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,180
Oh, you should leave now. Thank you.

140
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,080
- Goodbye, I'm going.
- What is that?

141
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,130
Hey, how did you know?

142
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,370
How did she know?

143
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,490
No matter how young you are, you really don't have any thoughts.

144
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,580
Why? You told me to "be gone with the wind" and run away from home.

145
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,150
Hey, how could you take what I said as a joke so seriously?

146
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,320
It's a joke, a joke. A gag.

147
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,110
This is why they say to be careful around kids.

148
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,530
Hey, hey. You should take that call. You'll make them worry.

149
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,770
Our household doesn't worry.

150
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,530
They'll only yell at me.

151
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,920
You can talk to them. "I'm an adult now."

152
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,820
"Give me the right to decide if I should or should not compete in concours." Huh?

153
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,650
If talking worked, would I have run away from home?

154
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,230
Even so, how can you leave home like this?

155
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,230
Where are you going to stay for the night?

156
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,940
- Are you worried that I won't have a place to go?
- Aigoo.

157
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,820
You and I Motel

158
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,980
Ah, I don't want to!

159
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,230
You wench. Why would you go to a scary place like that?

160
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,790
You don't know how scary the world is.

161
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,460
If I don't do this, I'll have to live like my parents' puppet for the rest of my life.

162
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,770
Is there a puppet like you that doesn't listen to what people say?

163
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,340
- What?
- Anyway, this isn't right.

164
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,140
If you want to leave home, get permission.

165
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,280
Why would I get permission to run away from home? I don't want to.

166
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,250
This, this. Look at this girl!

167
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,730
I really didn't see you like this. You're so stubborn.

168
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,830
Hey!

169
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,880
Is there such thing as a parent that doesn't worry about their child?

170
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,620
Min Seo Young!

171
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey, you rascal!

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,750
Dad.

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,700
Excuse me. Nice to meet--

174
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,420
you.

175
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,500
Did you have dinner?

176
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,510
Well, we ate.

177
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,620
It wasn't a meal, but.

178
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,670
Follow me.

179
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,740
I don't want to. I'm not going back.

180
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,810
This girl.

181
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,450
I too, have times when I want to stand on the stage,

182
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,000
and when I don't even want to look at it.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,810
Why won't you even ask about how I feel?

184
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,930
I got it, so come back.

185
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,780
Let's talk when we get back.

186
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,390
Go.

187
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,270
Aigoo, they're still a problem at that age.

188
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,200
But how old is he?

189
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,640
It looks like the age difference isn't too much.

190
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,330
Aigoo.

191
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,650
Boyfriend?

192
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,360
You are?

193
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,100
With whose permission?

194
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,410
All, stop!

195
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,300
What are you doing right now? You're making him scared.

196
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,810
No, no. I'm okay.

197
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,540
Our youngest... Are you getting mad at your brothers?

198
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,760
- Because of a man?
- Really.

199
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,660
There's no use raising a younger sister.

200
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,410
- What are you doing? Take one.
- Pardon?

201
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,570
- Take one.
- Yes. Thank you.

202
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,610
Why did you gather here?

203
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,180
Because we couldn't contact our youngest.

204
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,990
We agreed to go on a family vacation, but there was no reply.

205
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,900
So why would you leave our perfectly good home and move into the dorms?

206
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,320
Are you asking that because you don't know?

207
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,220
Our youngest, eat well.

208
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,170
Little brother Jae Woo, I'm watching you.

209
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,500
What are you watching? Don't you dare contact him.

210
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,260
Hurry up and leave.

211
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,050
- Leave.
- We're going.

212
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,970
Goodbye. Please go carefully.

213
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,870
You had four brothers.

214
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,550
What a big family.

215
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,670
Hm?

216
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,880
Press the "0" button.

217
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,580
Smart Jae Woo ♥

218
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,840
Do numbers start from one? They start from zero.

219
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,390
You're #0.

220
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,430
I'm saying that you're unrivaled and you can't be ranked.

221
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,130
#0, wow. #0.

222
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,710
That's really nice.

223
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,290
But why?

224
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,090
Because I'm easy?

225
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,480
Yeah. Because you're easy.

226
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,540
I'm.. I'm not that easy.

227
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,310
I like easy people.

228
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,550
People who show their emotions. Whether they're irritated, mad, or happy.

229
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,440
People who are predictable, so I know what they're doing 24/7.

230
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,010
I like those kinds of people. Like you.

231
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,340
So that was the case.

232
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,510
Oh, it wasn't because I was easy to touch and kiss.

233
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,550
Kissing you is really hard for me.

234
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,110
Even though the number of kisses is a lot, I still think about it 10 times before doing it.

235
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,280
Ten times?

236
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,870
Look at you.

237
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,380
Sorry.

238
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,960
I only thought about it five times.

239
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,980
I did it. Ten times.

240
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,910
Aren't you going to school?

241
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,550
Mom, what's the matter?

242
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,780
About her. She's really strange these days.

243
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,300
She was strange to begin with.

244
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,450
Aigoo, you pay no attention to your younger sister.

245
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,760
Aigoo.

246
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,350
Why are you like this now, Honey? Do you have something you're thinking about?

247
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,840
Huh?

248
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,480
No, the thing is...

249
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,780
Nothing.

250
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,160
Ah, what is it?

251
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,980
Honey... What do you think about Jin Joo getting married into a rich household?

252
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,990
What about the son of the chairman of a university?

253
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,290
Aigoo. I should work harder to earn more money.

254
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,170
That household's mother-in-law will look down on us because we don't have money.

255
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,560
You're worrying about useless things again, this punk.

256
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,290
Do you think only mother-in-laws from a wealthy household would mistreat us?

257
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,620
A father-in-law from a penniless household is scarier.

258
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,420
Why do you turn on the water so high?

259
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,690
If you do this, there will be more spraying water than washing water! This is all money!

260
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,610
You're letting all the money flow down the drain!

261
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,690
Save water. This is how we can eat and live.

262
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,360
Really! Do you think I'll eat and live just because I save some water?

263
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,780
You tightwad!

264
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,420
What? Tightwad?!

265
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,780
Yeah, tightwad!

266
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,360
Tigh-- Aigoo! It's coming.

267
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,820
Mom. Those words are harsh towards Father. Why would you call him a tightwad?

268
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,860
Right. It's harsh in your eyes too, right?

269
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,860
How can you call the hardworking breadwinner of the family a tightwad?

270
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,630
How can you say that to the breadwinner?

271
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,210
Does someone earn little money because they want to? Is someone frugal because they want to be?

272
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,480
That's right. Huh?

273
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,080
Even if a person can't earn as much as a gum seller, you can't say words like that.

274
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,180
Do you know how hard Father works in order to earn that much? Am I right, Dad?

275
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,220
Mom, don't be like that. Really. It's so sad. I'm leaving.

276
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,010
You rascal! What? A gum seller?

277
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,840
That's right. You must be so happy that your Father earns as much as a gum seller, you punk.

278
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,060
Then go earn that much then!

279
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,410
Aigoo, I'm helping you right now, Father!

280
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,990
- This rascal!
- Ah, why are you like this?

281
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,720
Get out! Hey!

282
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,890
Tell me the truth. The way I see it, something's going on with you nowadays.

283
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,670
What? Nothing's wrong.

284
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,470
"Nothing's wrong." Try to fool a ghost.

285
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,750
Who is Seo Jin?

286
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,550
Mom, how do you--

287
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,520
Who is Seo Jin? You cry his name "Seo Jin, Seo Jin" every night.

288
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,370
Seo Jin...

289
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,600
Seo Jin... Seo Jin...

290
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:08,340
I was going to ignore it because I thought you got rejected by someone you like, but it's not even one day.

291
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,260
Who is this Seo Jin?

292
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,700
Look here. Look here.

293
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,730
How much did you like him that you're like this?

294
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,360
That is... Mom..

295
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,760
Yeah, tell me.

296
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,850
Let's go to the bathhouse. I'll wash your back.

297
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,450
What?

298
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,450
Let's go.

299
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,810
I was told not to tell you, but I thought that you should know, Noona.

300
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,160
She submitted a leave of absence?

301
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,420
Yeah. She didn't go into detail, but she said she had some family affairs and had to leave.

302
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,210
What the heck, Cheon Seol? I can't even reach you.

303
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,760
So? What happened?

304
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,830
I'm going to compete in this concours, and then they'll let me rest for a while.

305
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,720
That's a relief. See? I told you that you should talk it out.

306
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,280
How could they have known that you were struggling this much? It's not like they've raised a child before.

307
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,360
As expected, you're like an Ahjussi.

308
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,250
Hey, how can you call me an Ahjussi.

309
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,910
This face. This body. What about is like an Ahjussi's?

310
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,590
Things like this.

311
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,130
Things like this?

312
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,040
Aigoo, it really is a relief.

313
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,180
I was worried if I shouldn't have come to rile you up and turn you into a troubled girl.

314
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,490
Did you go somewhere?

315
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,020
No, I'm just saying. I worried a little bit.

316
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,570
You.

317
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,480
You don't like me, right?

318
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,970
What?

319
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,420
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

320
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,950
I thought you liked me.

321
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,050
But I felt something weird yesterday.

322
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,100
I was talking to my dad for a long time, but

323
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,870
I saw you in my dad's stare.

324
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,080
What does that mean?

325
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,440
Usually, when you like someone, you can see hearts coming out of their eyes.

326
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,030
But you. You had the same stare as my father's.

327
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,640
And you talk the same too.

328
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,340
Hey, that's just because you worried--

329
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,520
Anyway.

330
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,260
If you really liked me, you would've regretted that you sent me home yesterday.

331
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,010
She still hasn't come to her senses yet.

332
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,780
It's so cool.

333
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,730
Hey. Napoleon said this.

334
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,710
"If I fulfill my dream, I will become someone's dream."

335
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,300
Dreams don't exist just so you can have them. They exist so you can make them come true.

336
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,770
Sunbaenim! What is that?

337
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,220
This is a swimming pool.

338
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,450
Hey, what's happening for him to be acting like that?

339
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,430
I made this myself, you rascal!

340
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,470
Class President... He's showing off submitting his model to the architecture competition.

341
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,650
That, that.

342
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,370
If he was going to do all that, why didn't he go to the architecture department instead of civil engineering department?

343
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,830
Hey, did we come to Civil Engineerin just because we wanted to? We came based on our grades.

344
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,580
Hey, did someone loosen a screw in his head or something? What's wrong with him?

345
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,580
I don't know. Yesterday, he was calling Yoon Bo Reum a bad wench

346
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,210
but today he's biting and sucking on his phone. He's doing all sorts of things, aigoo.

347
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,930
I don't have anything else to say to you.

348
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,490
Don't fall too deep.

349
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,820
I'll give you back the report you wrote in the beginning of the semester about what you'll be doing in 20 years.

350
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,940
Hold onto it, and look back on it in twenty years.

351
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,250
Not to disappoint anyone, could a few of you present theirs?

352
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,640
In about 20 years, I'll have fulfilled my long range dream of becoming an architect and

353
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,810
something that Korea has never attempted to build...

354
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,470
I'll be working hard on building environment friendly architectures.

355
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,930
Aigoo, it feels like you're already an architect.

356
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,870
I will make sure to fulfill my dream!

357
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,360
This is all guaranteed, so if you don't get hurt in the future, you can get everything back.

358
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,690
It's a good deal. Let me ask this favor of you once.

359
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,360
Thank you!

360
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,700
Me in twenty years.

361
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,800
Me in Twenty Years

362
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,190
Planning for the future: In 20 years, I will be...

363
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,610
Korea's best movie director.

364
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:36,840
I'll receive Baeksang Arts Award. I'll enter the Cannes Movie Festival.

365
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,200
I have a nice dream.

366
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,210
This girl! Why are you in such a hurry that you won't dry your hair all the way through?

367
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,310
Aigoo, it's okay, you dry your hair.

368
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,240
If you go out like that, you'll catch a cold.

369
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,600
It's so nice to see such a nice family. Are you a college student?

370
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,590
Yes.

371
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,050
Our eldest daughter is a college student too. She goes to Hanguk University.

372
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,860
Oh my, really? She goes to Hanguk University too!

373
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,120
Really? Aigoo, you must've studied well.

374
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,560
You have to study well in order to get into that university.

375
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,440
Our eldest daughter studied so hard because her mother was suffering.

376
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,020
She said she wanted to get a scholarship.

377
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,450
Aigoo, your daughter is so diligent! You're so lucky.

378
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:06,240
I work for that. My daughter is the only thing I can be proud of.

379
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,310
Ahjumma! Give me the massage!

380
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,130
Yes, I'm going!

381
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,070
Goodbye.

382
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,360
Mom, please eat this.

383
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,210
Why did you want to take a bath with mom all of a sudden?

384
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,690
You used to say it was embarrassing and never was around bathhouses.

385
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,630
Just because.

386
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,490
When would I ever scrub your back again?

387
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,100
Why? You only went once and say you made up for it all?

388
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,690
No.

389
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,660
Oh, my goodness.

390
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,970
Aigoo...

391
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,980
Gun Yeong Mart

392
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,570
This is nice.

393
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,150
Just wait a little.

394
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,320
Aw, you're so pretty!

395
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,270
Aigoo, is mommy's milk that yummy?

396
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,870
He's chubby thanks to mommy's milk.

397
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,450
Aigoo, so happy, so happy.

398
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,740
Is he pretty?

399
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,600
Of course he is.

400
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,880
But, when you were that little, you were the prettiest.

401
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,750
Your cheeks were so chubby because of my milk.

402
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,380
Aigoo, so pretty. So pretty.

403
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,900
Oh, so pretty.

404
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,390
Bye, bye.

405
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,630
You'll really love my son when you see him.

406
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,930
Oh, you. You haven't even gotten married and you're thinking about having a son?

407
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,030
Oh, ha. Will a kid have a kid?

408
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,150
But still, he'll be so cute if he takes after you with small and distinct features.

409
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,830
Right?

410
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,710
What's wrong with you?

411
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,450
What's with you all of a sudden?

412
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,340
Aigoo!

413
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,830
Ma Jin Joo

414
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,660
He looks just like his father.

415
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,610
He looks just like you!

416
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,260
The nose and mouth are like Ban Do's.

417
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,980
His ears and eyes look just like Ban o when he was a baby.

418
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,830
So pale!

419
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,820
Right, honey?

420
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,210
That's Jin Joo, not him. He was dark from the time he was born.

421
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,070
What kind of baby would be so dark? When he was this small,

422
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,730
he was so pale. He's just like him.

423
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,280
So, cute!

424
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,750
Oh, Jin Joo, you went through a lot of hardships.

425
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,390
I heard you had a long labor.

426
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,270
Giving birth is no ordinary task. You went through so much, Jin Joo.

427
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,540
It's okay, everyone does it anyway.

428
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,770
Oh, look at how he's smiling, honey!

429
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,680
He looks just like Ban Do.

430
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,560
That's what I'm saying!

431
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,020
Hey, I'm your grandpa, boy!

432
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,070
He recognized you.

433
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,490
Mom. Mom.

434
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,290
Mom.

435
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,640
Mom.

436
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,720
What's wrong with you?

437
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,240
You went through a lot.

438
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,900
What?

439
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,790
You went through a lot giving birth to me, Mom.

440
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,060
What?

441
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,520
What's with you all of a sudden?

442
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,960
You went through a lot.

443
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,800
Okay.

444
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,120
Okay, stop crying. No more tears!

445
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,570
Cheon Seol disappeared.

446
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,980
Okay, I'll go.

447
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,870
Hey, Cheon Seol disappeared all of a sudden.

448
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,550
Oh, right.

449
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,430
She took a leave of absence right about this time.

450
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,750
- Are you psychic?
- Huh?

451
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,990
I didn't say anything about her taking time off from school.

452
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,620
Well, it's obvious, anyway.

453
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,720
Ma Jin Joo... she's so nosy.

454
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,460
Move aside!

455
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,860
Hey, Go Dok. Where are you going?

456
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,830
I'm getting money!

457
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,760
What?

458
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,780
Something about how his father's wallet has a rip or something?

459
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,060
He must be going to get some money, so he doesn't get beat up.

460
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,350
Where is he going to get money from?

461
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,770
Where else would he get money from?

462
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,860
His father's money bag.

463
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,630
Jin Joo

464
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,510
There were these 2 on top of the desk.

465
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,190
Yours and mine.

466
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,580
Hey, this is the thing in our home.

467
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,910
Why would that be in your home?

468
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,910
- What?
- It's handmade.

469
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,040
Geez, seriously.

470
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,480
Why'd he come along?

471
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,890
I didn't have much to do.

472
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,250
There might be a reason she couldn't tell us about.

473
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,170
Should we just wait for her to contact us?

474
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,790
No, she's not going to contact you.

475
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,360
Or, she could just come next semester.

476
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,690
She's not coming.

477
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,180
Hey! Really, you ...

478
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,930
Hey, what's wrong with you?

479
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,870
Right, so if we want to find her, we have to do it now.

480
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,880
She won't come back. Did you call her home?

481
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,170
Yeah, but her mom doesn't know, either.

482
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,450
I didn't tell her because I didn't want to worry her needlessly.

483
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,860
You have to.

484
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,870
It's not even a small thing. She's taking time off from school. Does it make sense that her parents wouldn't know?

485
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,730
Of course. You have to let her know.

486
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,710
You worry about your kids all the time anyway.

487
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,680
Yoon Bo Reum... how come she's still scary even after I'm much older?

488
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,720
The viciousness in her eyes...

489
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,450
She was so mean when she left Ahn Jae Woo, too.

490
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,410
Hey, careful with what you say.

491
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,160
Well, of course. I'm not a kid.

492
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,300
You know, right?

493
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,400
Know what?

494
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,990
Yoon Bo Reum... she dumped Ahn Jae Woo like she kicked an empty can. All of sudden at that.

495
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,330
She must've told you the reason why she broke up with Jae Woo.

496
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,320
Whatever, I don't know. Mind your own business.

497
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,550
Anyway, where did Cheon Seol really go?

498
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,900
She must've gone after someone who took her money or is staying with some pyramid scheme people.

499
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,150
Those are biggest reasons behind people's disappearance.

500
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,190
Hey!

501
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,160
I just said it so you could laugh.

502
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,010
Will worrying right now change anything?

503
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,530
Just try your best looking for her starting tomorrow.

504
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,800
Didn't you say not to find Cheon Seol in the past?

505
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,980
That was because I was young.

506
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,920
I thought I was being considerate of her then.

507
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,860
Besides, you're not going to look for her anyway just because I say so?

508
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,140
What?

509
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
That cup mat.

510
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,680
The one that's all faded. The one I told you to throw away. Isn't that the one?

511
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,990
Yeah, that's right.

512
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:47,120
The fact that you kept that for 18 years means you were that much concerned about her. That Cheon Seol.

513
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,040
Even if I didn't use it... how can I toss something a friend gave me?

514
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,340
Yeah, exactly. So, find her for sure this time.

515
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,690
Ahjumma... you're so affectionate.

516
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,070
Oh, and.

517
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,680
Did you get back home safely yesterday?

518
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,520
Why do you have a phone if you're not going to answer it?

519
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,430
You called me yesterday?

520
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,190
I didn't see anything. Why?

521
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,270
Director Park.

522
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,510
It was nothing. Never mind.

523
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,340
What about Director Park? Don't stop what you were going to say.

524
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,220
I called you because something came up, but.

525
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,700
I had high hopes for no reason.

526
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,250
What are you saying?

527
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,390
I'm saying you were never there for me when I needed you.

528
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,670
What?

529
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,960
Just go. I'm going in.

530
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,630
I'm saying you were never there for me when I needed you.

531
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,880
Choi Ban Do, please come quickly.

532
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,900
Ban Do, please come fast.

533
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,450
Because of you,

534
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,530
Because of you, my mom couldn't see my face before she passed.

535
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,200
It's you, right? The student.

536
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,840
The student who helped me there.

537
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,610
Hello.

538
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,200
Yes, that's right.

539
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,100
If he tries to help you again, kick him with your foot.

540
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,130
That jerk.

541
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,220
- I'll take that.
- Hold on.

542
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,830
Are you, by any chance,

543
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,130
Seo Jin?

544
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,840
Pardon?

545
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,090
It must be true.

546
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,700
Thanks for helping me that time,

547
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,590
but I don't like boys who make my daughter cry.

548
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,940
What are you saying?

549
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:03,120
I was wondering how great the boy was for her to be crying every single night.

550
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,490
Anyway, thanks for that time you helped me.

551
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,200
Goodbye.

552
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,780
He's not all that. Why would she like him so?

553
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,970
It's Choi Ban Do.

554
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,480
My name.

555
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,450
I'm Choi Ban Do.

556
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,560
You're not Seo Jin?

557
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,890
Yes.

558
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,660
Cheon Seol.

559
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,950
Oh, I see. So, you do have a bad drinking habit. You can fix bad habits like that.

560
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,570
Good luck.

561
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:56,180
Hey, where are you going?

562
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,220
Hey, this is yours!

563
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,100
Just let me run into you, seriously!

564
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,520
So detailed.

565
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,510
I've stole from you for many years. You don't think I made one of these?

566
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,690
My father thinks I'm so sloppy.

567
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,670
What are you doing?

568
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,470
Just go.

569
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,530
Be quiet. I told you to leave.

570
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,290
Just go!

571
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:57,110
Father!

572
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,400
Go Dok Jae!

573
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,610
Are you not going to stop?

574
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,640
- Stop right there!
- I'm sorry.

575
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,800
Guest!

576
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,350
Go in!

577
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,690
- No!
- Stop right there!

578
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,340
Come here!

579
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,830
Come!

580
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,930
This bastard!

581
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,480
Dad, I'm sorry!

582
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,320
Are you not coming out?

583
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,550
Why would I go out there and risk my funeral?

584
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,800
Go Dok Jae?

585
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,670
Gosh, that scared me.

586
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,600
Cheon Seol? Why are you here?

587
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,290
Why are you here?

588
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,210
I raised my child to be a thief!

589
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,030
You can starve in there and die, or come out and die in my hands.

590
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,030
Father, have you seen anyone die of starvation in a kitchen?

591
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,450
Are you not coming out, you bastard?

592
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,850
Oh, this is your shop. I didn't know.

593
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,850
Yeah, my place.

594
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,050
Then, work hard.

595
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,380
Yeah, you, too. Hey, where are you going?

596
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,130
I'm going.

597
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,700
Hey, if this door opens, I'm dead.

598
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,450
Oh, right. I'm doing all of this because of someone.

599
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,170
Give me money for the cost of the wallet.

600
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,700
- What?
-  What?

601
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,540
My wallet that you ripped up after you got drunk!

602
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,090
I mean, my dad's wallet.

603
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,550
Where are you running off to?

604
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,450
I won't fall for your tricks twice.

605
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,190
You bastard, are you not coming out?

606
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,910
Oh, Dad. I came here and found a hostage.

607
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:39,870
So... you know you have to pay overtime if she leaves after her work hours, right?

608
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,780
Just get in trouble and get past it.

609
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,620
It's okay. Long time ago, my chin broke after getting beat up by my dad.

610
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:54,330
Father, be ready to overpay your part-timer or give up and go home.

611
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,010
You're in a tough situation, Father.

612
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,950
- Hey, knock it off.
- It's okay.

613
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,160
You're taking time off from school? Why?

614
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,790
My major doesn't suit me and there's nothing else I want to do. I should just make some money.

615
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,490
You can just earn money later on.

616
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,700
If you start earning it early, you can get more money.

617
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,830
The world isn't like that. You can't catch up to the rich ones.

618
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,380
Don't tell anyone about me being here.

619
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,090
Even to your friends.

620
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,270
I got it. My mouth is very heavy.

621
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,080
- Follow me!
- Dad, it's going to rip!

622
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,620
Die?

623
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,690
My ear's going to rip!

624
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,550
Dad, I love you!

625
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,510
Dad!

626
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,430
Dad, I love you. Dad, I'll be good to you!

627
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,010
Dad, please! Your son's going to die. Dok Jae's going to die!

628
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:02,350
Times are hard in our family. Her father's back got injured so he's resting right now.

629
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,750
She matured fast. We were afraid of her doing something like this so we didn't tell her about her dad's injury.

630
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,010
It seems like her younger sibling told her about it recently.

631
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:25,320
Wow, this girl really didn't make it obvious. We didn't know for months.

632
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,220
I didn't know two times.

633
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,440
You were here.

634
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,270
Did you not find Cheon Seol?

635
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,080
What? Cheon Seol disappeared?

636
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,640
Yeah. You haven't seen her, right?

637
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,790
I've seen her.

638
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,810
- Really?
- Where?

639
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,530
Busan.

640
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,970
What?

641
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,510
Busan! That's where my dad's side of the family is from.  (T/N: For bon-jeok, the words sound the same, but have different meanings.)

642
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,020
Weren't you talking about that? It's Busan.

643
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,070
Gosh, you're crazy. Is this the right time to joke around?

644
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:05,300
She's not even a kid, why do you want to find her? She's probably doing well wherever she may be.

645
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,300
When you disappear and no one knows where you went, then I'll really pretend nothing happened.

646
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,560
Cheon Seol's mom already reported her disappearance. So, we'll just have to wait now.

647
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,100
What? She reported the disappearance?

648
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:29,040
Cheon Seol!

649
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,370
You girl, seriously!

650
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,610
What are you doing here?

651
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,710
Why are you doing this? It's making us sad.

652
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,040
Oh, you.

653
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,270
Are you doing okay?

654
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,420
All the big corporations filed bankruptcy during IMF...

655
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,520
Would my dad's Mom and Pop business survive?

656
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,060
It was too much for them to send me to college.

657
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,460
Dad works in a construction site; Mom works in a bathhouse.

658
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,130
They don't make much money per day. How can I go to college?

659
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:21,170
You know, even when I'm buying one textbook, I think to myself,

660
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,710
"This is the amount that my mom earns from scrubbing a stranger's back."

661
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:33,020
When I see my registration fee invoice, I think "My dad with a bad back can't take a day off this month."

662
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,770
That was how I always felt.

663
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,550
You should've told us. You were by yourself.

664
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,610
How could I tell you? You guys would be sad, too.

665
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,350
Even when I had fun with you guys,

666
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,250
I thought if it was really the time for me to be laughing and having fun.

667
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,380
It felt like I was floating in the air by myself.

668
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:00,990
No matter how I thought about it, those two were working hard day and night to earn money.

669
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,530
- I realized I couldn't just be happily studying.
- Hey!

670
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,400
It's supposed to be like that.

671
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,540
The parents are supposed to work hard to get money while their child happily studies.

672
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:17,880
If you do this, do you think your parents will like it and think, "Oh, our daughter's earning money?"

673
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:27,640
You're young. How did you grow up that fast?

674
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:34,800
Do you know how many times my mom scrubs people's backs?

675
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,220
It's more than twenty people.

676
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:44,440
My mom goes out to work again even though her wrist hurts so much that she can't even hold a spoon and chopsticks.

677
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,640
After seeing that, how could I...

678
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,650
I do it because I like it, why?

679
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,510
Mom.

680
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,250
I'm doing it so my child can study.

681
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:04,780
Why do you act like a kid without any parents? If you fail in business, you can't even be a parent to your own child?

682
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,910
Why do you act like an adult when you're only a kid?

683
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:13,270
We failed in business. We didn't fail in life.

684
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:19,350
Your father and I can build up many times over again until we marry you guys off.

685
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,620
Why is someone young like you acting like an adult? It's upsetting.

686
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,520
Mom.

687
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,100
Mom, I'm sorry.

688
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,110
Mom, I'm sorry.

689
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:49,300
I did good.

690
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:55,080
What a relief that it worked out well.

691
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,470
Wow, we were so close to never seeing her for the rest of our life.

692
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,450
I know.

693
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:05,070
Ma Jin Joo, how did you think of calling her mom?

694
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:09,740
Isn't that the person who should know about it first? The mom.

695
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,190
Yeah, she would've been more hurt if she found out about it later on.

696
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:20,100
You're sort of like an adult.

697
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,490
Wait, no. In three weeks, you've changed so much.

698
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,310
Am I like an old woman?

699
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:27,500
Yeah. A little?

700
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,340
Really? It must be obvious.

701
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,800
You must know.

702
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:25,990
Sorry. My daughter's been acting strangely lately that it's made me sensitive.

703
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,070
Jin Joo?

704
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,910
Oh, right. You know each other.

705
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,230
Anyway, I'm sorry.

706
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,300
Oh, this.

707
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:47,350
Jin Joo loves peaches so I buy them every day. You can have these.

708
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:56,200
Then you can bring everything except for the peaches.

709
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,730
My older sister's sending fruits.

710
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,670
Oh, really?

711
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,200
Yeah, everything's good besides the peaches.

712
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,620
Right. She was a huge fan of peaches.

713
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,480
Why are you just sitting there for, man?

714
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,600
Hey, you have a peach allergy. Why'd you get these and bring them here?

715
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,890
Gosh, you scared me.

716
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:33,020
That punk... Hey!

717
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,500
Children's Jurassic Dinosaur Museum

718
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,920
Seo Jin.

719
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,990
Do you like dinosaurs or your mom?

720
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,270
Mom? Oh, how cute you are!

721
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,120
Oh, yeah? Dad?

722
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,330
Kiss Dad dinosaur!

723
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:16,940
Good job. Oh, Seo Jin, it's as if you'll be sucked into the TV.

724
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,920
Do you really like dinosaurs that much?

725
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,140
Are you having fun?

726
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:28,270
♫ Your feelings which I carelessly passed by ♫

727
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:34,320

Are you Seo Jin?

731
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,530
She's been crying every night so I was wondering how great the boy was.

Choi Ban Do! Wake up!

00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,760
Ma Jin Joo.

749
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,190

Right?

756

I'm really thankful.

757
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,300
It's nothing big. I was going to get insurance anyway.

758
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,320
Eat up. This place is really good.

759
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,830
Thank you for the meal!

760
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,780
Do you contact people from school?

761
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,640
Of course. You cut off connections with everyone even though you were the president of our major.

762
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,410
Our civil engineering department... we're as good as dead without loyalty.

763
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,490
If you talked to them, they would listen.

764
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:36,820
That's true. I was embarrassed to see the underclassmen so I didn't really feel like attending any reunions.

765
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,660
I didn't contact them.

766
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,570
What's embarrassing?

767
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,120
You know how I went around showing off saying I'll become an architect?

768
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,800
It's embarrassing. And asking people for favors like this,

769
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,730
it sort of harms my pride.

770
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:54,350
Well, it's not like no one had dreams in college.

771
00:57:54,350 --> 00:58:02,980
That's true. You know, when you have a child, there's nothing you can't do.

772
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:09,430
♬  If the answer for that is love ♬

773
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:15,580
♬  I'm going to love everything in this world. ♬

774
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,650
Is it a boy or girl?

775
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,910
A boy!

776
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,910
Should I show you?

777
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,570
Yes, show me.

778
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,090
- Here.
- Oh, wow!

779
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:24,910
So handsome!

780
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,080
Do you have a kid?

781
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,070
Yeah, I have a son, too. He's three years old.

782
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,340
Huh?

783
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,830
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah, he is.

784
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,310
If the youth have strong weapons like dreams and passion,

Seo Jin, I'm your dad.

789
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,560
Dad.

790
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,330
It's our child.

791
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,940
This is so amazing.

792
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,950
Choi Ban Do, let's do this right.

793
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:12,560
Let's protect our kid forever.

00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,650
Yeah.

Seo Jin, your dad's going to protect you forever.

796
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,020
Aw, our baby. So this is what you look like.

797
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,740
Mom missed you a lot.

798
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:30,020
♬  I will love everything in this world ♬

799
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:51,390
♫ There would be more mistakes and times of distress ♫

800
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:59,310
♫ We realized we couldn't avoid it ♫

801
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:05,820
♫ If the answer for that is love ♫

802
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,200
♫ I will love everything in this world ♫
