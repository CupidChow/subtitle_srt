1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,700
Um...

2
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,850
Come quickly, Ban Do.

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,580
I have to go quickly!

4
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,310
Detective, I really have to go.

5
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,240
Let go!

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,820
Why are you like this?

7
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,850
Because of you... My mom

8
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,230
passed before she could look at my face.

9
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,910
Due to circumstances even beyond anyone's fault..

10
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,710
There are times when your heart is all tangled up.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,010
Eat.

12
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,480
Eat one more bite.

13
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,630
Should I not do that?

14
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,110
The wing?

15
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,010
What do we do?

16
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,920
Honey.

17
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
You're here?

18
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
- Yeah, I'm here. - What about dinner?

19
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,870
I didn't have dinner. I'm hungry.

20
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,050
Get washed up and come. I'll prepare dinner for you.

21
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,620
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,730
What are we going to do for your dad's birthday?

23
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,520
Oh, it's already his birthday? What should we do?

24
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,810
At that time, we were conceited enough to believe that time would heal.

25
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,550
We shouldn't have ignored it nor neglected it.

26
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:51,260
Perhaps we should've untangled our feelings one at a time..

27
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,850
Let's get a divorce.

28
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,700
We're too unhappy.

29
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm so unhappy!

30
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,770
Okay, let's get a divorce.

31
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,810
Let's get a divorce!

32
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,310
A tangled ball of yarn bloated up like a huge snow ball.

33
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,010
before it swallowed us.

34
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,000
Episode 11
Tangled feelings will grow bigger when we ignore and neglect them..

35
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,950
What's this?

36
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,690
Grapes.

37
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,630
Am I'm asking because I don't know?

38
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,940
Why am I like this?

39
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,730
Why does nothing

40
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,800
work out the way I want it to?

41
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,220
I have never been insincere. Not even once...

42
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,170
I tried and worked so hard.

43
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,950
Ten years ago, like today...

44
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,780
It's all a mess.

45
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,570
Why is everything...

46
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,110
I tried my best to live a good life.

47
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,510
Why am I always sorry and apologizing?

48
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,120
Like you,

49
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,850
I missed mother-in-law.

50
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,450
I missed mother-in-law like you!

51
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,990
What's all of this?

52
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,470
Mom.

53
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,540
Mother-in-law?

54
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,530
You look young. You've married already?

55
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,270
Why are you crying?

56
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,280
What about you?

57
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,650
No way. What's your relationship with him?

58
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,250
It's not that!

59
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,810
Mom, don't think weirdly about it.

60
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,290
It's not that.

61
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,220
It's not.

62
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,470
Mother-in-law, it really isn't like that.

63
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,910
Something bad happened to my friend from school.

64
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,870
So, that's why. Right?

65
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,090
Let's go in, Mom.

66
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,540
What about dinner?

67
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,620
Pardon?

68
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,210
Mom, why would you bring him inside?

69
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,690
You said he's your friend.

70
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,560
He helped me that one time before.

71
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,070
How can I just send a guest home who came to our home around meal time?

72
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,880
He says he's hungry, too.

73
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,840
Please give me Jin Joo.

74
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,670
No way! What kind of struggles would you put her through? She's still young!

75
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,080
Dad, let us marry.

76
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,210
We have to. There's a reason.

77
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,330
A reason?

78
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,470
You're young. Did you go and get pregnant-

79
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,370
You!

80
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,590
Are you crazy? You're crazy.

81
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,440
- You're crazy!
- No, it's not that!

82
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,660
Hey, you. Are you not coming out?

83
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,480
Why did you say such a thing ...

84
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,490
It's not that!

85
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,050
I don't want to be separated from him for even a day.

86
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,140
Hey, you...

87
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,680
Come out here!

88
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,980
You can't!

89
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,540
Mother!

90
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,640
Mother-in-law.

91
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,430
Mother-in-law, take this allowance.

92
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,310
Oh, why would you again? It's fine. You use it.

93
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,180
You worked hard to earn that. Why give it to me?

94
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm making money to enjoy doing this. To give you some spending money.

95
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,570
If you don't take this, your son-in-law will be disappointed.

96
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,540
Oh, you. Okay.

97
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,800
Thanks, Son-in-law Choi.. I'll use it well.

98
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,000
- You have to keep it a secret.
- Okay.
- Son-in-law Choi.

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,690
Yes, father-in-law, I'm going!

100
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,380
They say the heaven gets jealous and splits a married couple when they are too much in love.

101
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,910
If I'd known this, maybe I would've argued a bit more with her.

102
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,410
Still, it's nice to have a son-like son-in-law like you.

103
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,770
I couldn't even cry in front of my daughters.

104
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,660
Son-in-law Choi, thank you.

105
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,320
Name?

106
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,850
Choi Ban Do.

107
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,520
Age?

108
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,440
Twenty.

109
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,230
- Do you drink?
- Huh?

110
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,170
Look at you. Are you doing a population survey?

111
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,530
He helped me before and I misinterpreted things, so he's getting food.

112
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,910
It's okay.

113
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,790
Don't worry about it. Just eat up.

114
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,330
I only put an extra spoon on the meal we normally eat. I don't know if there's much to eat here.

115
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,810
Yes.

116
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,550
Mother-in-law, thank you for the food.

117
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,420
I went to the market to make fried chicken that you like so much, Ban Do.

118
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
They were out of chickens.

119
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,240
This is a feast.

120
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,800
If you keep setting food up like this as if the table will collapse,

121
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,920
I'll come every day.

122
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,980
Wow, your lip service is truly great.

123
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,460
It's not lip service. I'm being serious.

124
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,400
Okay, okay. Eat up.

125
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,330
Thank you for the food!

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,930
Jin Joo, you, too.

127
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,120
My kids don't eat this unless I clean it up for them.

128
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,740
I washed my hands. It's fine, right?

129
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,330
Yes.

130
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,080
All right. Eat up.

131
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,610
Like you, I missed mother-in-law.

132
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,590
I missed her, just like you.

133
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,250
- What are you doing instead of eating?
- Huh?

134
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,010
Eat slowly so you don't get an upset stomach.

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,310
Mom, stop giving me it and eat.

136
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,920
You can eat it. Have this. Oh, you.

137
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,880
Hurry and eat.

138
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll figure it out and eat by myself.

139
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,600
Here, here. I made this new. Try it.

140
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,700
Stop and eat.

141
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,890
You eat up.

142
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,760
I ate well, thank you.

143
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,950
I didn't really have anything to prepare tonight.

144
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,770
If you come next time, I'll make good food. What do you like?

145
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,260
Pardon?

146
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,350
Dak-bokkeum-tang. (T/N: Braised spicy chicken.)

147
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,440
Oh,  dak-bokkeum-tang? I'm good at making that.

148
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,210
Come again next time.

149
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,670
Yes, I will.

150
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,090
Why see him out? It's not like he's our son-in-law.

151
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,550
Just because. I haven't seen him that many times, but I feel for him whenever I see him.

152
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,860
The way he looks at me

153
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,430
it's just like how Jin Joo looks at me these days.

154
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,850
How strange.

155
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,080
Do you think both of them are seeing each other?

156
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,820
You know the guy who's dark like this? I don't like that guy.

157
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,870
Is there any boy that you  do  like?

158
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,050
Is he a long lost child of mine?

159
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,530
I can't even joke around.

160
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,960
What the heck...

161
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,300
Are you just using your body however you like because you got younger?

162
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,230
What's with that?

163
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,010
Why didn't you tell me?

164
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,880
About Director Park?

165
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,600
Something really bad could've happened.

166
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,890
Where'd you hear about it?

167
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,110
Since nothing too bad happened, it's fine.

168
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,680
It's really as you said.

169
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,480
When you needed me, I was never there for you.

170
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,180
It's true.

171
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,530
I always thought that I had taken care of you by your side.

172
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,280
Now I understand when you said you were unhappy.

173
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,000
Did I tell you to take care of me?

174
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,550
You didnt have to take care of me.

175
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,130
You should've just been by my side.

176
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,600
Instead of trying to make a living to feed me

177
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,450
you should've tried to eat  with  me.

178
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,340
If I cried, you should've cried and been sad with me.

179
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,690
I'm here.

180
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,540
Guess what I brought?

181
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,710
Tada, I brought you the steamed pork you like so much.

182
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,230
Stay where you are. I'm going to get changed and prepare this for you. Okay?

183
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,150
Don't move!

184
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,870
Even after time passed,

185
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,890
I can't forget it in here.

186
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,270
I know it wasn't your fault.

187
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,440
I also know that the situation was unavoidable.

188
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,250
That's why whenever I feel the blame coming up in my heart...

189
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,320
I held it down and kept it inside.

190
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,240
But to me like that...

191
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,060
why did you take it so lightly?

192
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,880
So that my sadness seems so small...

193
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,950
Why did you behave so lightly every time?

194
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,140
That's when it started. Our grating problem.

195
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,490
You should've looked into me.

196
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,960
You should've held me.

197
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,870
You should've cried with me.

198
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,610
What are you doing? Now that we have reached this point.

199
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,290
I wanted to make you laugh.

200
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,860
I was sorry to you and Mother-in-law.

201
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,730
I couldn't do anything.

202
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,820
That time,

203
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,920
I thought it was the only thing I could do.

204
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
I didn't want to make you cry more.

205
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,650
I wanted you make you laugh.

206
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,940
To just laugh.

207
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,300
We sure brought what I am talking about so soon.

208
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,980
Oh, I'm so hungry. So hungry.

209
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,910
Let's eat.

210
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,480
Thank you for the food.

211
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,350
Thank you for the food.

212
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,630
- Why is the soup so salty?
- Salty?

213
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,150
How is it salty? Mine's bland.

214
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,460
What are you saying? This is completely saltwater.

215
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,900
Why is the rice so salty?

216
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,980
Wait.

217
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,250
What's this? Why's mine the only one salty?

218
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,370
This woman...

219
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,520
Oh, what is it this time? Why are you angry? Why?

220
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,750
What's with your mom?

221
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,600
Would there be any other reason besides you?

222
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,210
Think about what you did wrong carefully.

223
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,610
I'm sure you can sense something. You lived together for 26 years.

224
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,210
Try living together for 100 years. See if you know her heart.

225
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,530
If someone's angry, say you're angry.

226
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,170
They should say it so I know.

227
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,780
She wanted to eat out for lunch so that's what we did.

228
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,900
Why is she angry?

229
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,710
Tell me! Tell me!

230
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,990
Do I have to tell you for you to know?

231
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,600
Of course, am I psychic or something?

232
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,400
How would I know how you feel?

233
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
You wanted to eat out so we did that.

234
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,730
I told you I wanted to eat out because I didn't want to eat the food in our house.

235
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,180
But you take me to eat home cooked style meal?

236
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,320
You cheapskate old man!

237
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,140
What is this? Then, you should've said that you didn't like it.

238
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,900
You've come this far without saying anything.

239
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,860
Must I teach you every single thing? Are you a stupid idiot?

240
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,890
Of course! If you don't say anything, how would I know?

241
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,240
How you feel! You know the taste of meat when you chew and know when you speak up.

242
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,910
What will you do with your mouth? Will you eat it up?

243
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,300
You really...

244
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,890
What's with Choi Ban Do these days?

245
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,710
Where did this Ahn Jae Woo bastard go?

246
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,170
This is why men are bad.

247
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,720
When they start dating, they throw away their friends like an empty can...

248
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,510
It's a can. Oh, were you abandoned, too?

249
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,760
My god.

250
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,990
What are you looking at?

251
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,140
Are you okay?

252
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,620
Who was that?

253
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,350
Go Dok Jae, you!

254
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,050
I'm so sorry, senior!

255
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,710
Just walk away, you fatty.

256
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,780
Are you out of your mind? You did it on purpose, right?

257
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,270
No, why would I do it on purpose to you?

258
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,560
I was in a bad mood to begin with...

259
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,790
I should just.

260
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,060
Be careful. You'll be dead.

261
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,870
I'm so sorry!

262
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,470
You, pig... Take this.

263
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,760
Take this!

264
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,110
You punk!

265
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,930
You're the best!

266
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,480
The best!

267
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,910
Go Dok Jae!

268
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,440
- You're home?
- Yeah.

269
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,090
You were walking him to the market. What took you so long?

270
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,840
Oh, did he leave that for us?

271
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,820
I thought he might've forgotten it and left it.

272
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,680
No, it's for you.

273
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,930
- For me?
- Yeah.

274
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,200
I was so sorry to you and Mother-in-law.

275
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,570
I couldn't do anything.

276
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,450
I didn't want to make you cry.

277
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,770
I wanted to make you laugh.

278
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,850
To just laugh.

279
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,000
You should've looked into me.

280
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,480
You should've held me.

281
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,900
You should've cried with me.

282
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,860
One, two, three, four.

283
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,290
Jae Woo, if you're not talented...

284
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,140
you have the option of quitting. Must you join the cheerleading squad?

285
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,270
How dare you criticize me? Your s*** sucks, man.

286
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,260
No, just look at yourself. This body won't do.

287
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,200
Looking at it, I can tell that you won't be able to do it in your whole life.

288
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,220
How about you? Go over there and do it. Why are you doing it next to me? You're embarrassing me. They can compare us.

289
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,860
Hey, attention.

290
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,250
The class of 99, come gather here.

291
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,870
Now, finally...
5th National College Cheerleading Competition

292
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,290
The schedule for the national cheerleading competition is out.

293
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,010
This is a competition of pride between universities.

294
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,270
Be sure to prepare well for the preliminary for the class of 99.

295
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,600
- Yes!
- That's all.

296
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,650
Yoon Bo Reum will be center anyway.

297
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,580
Look at you. Why say something so obvious so nicely?

298
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,310
Then, the competition for the center position who will partner up with you will be fierce.

299
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,320
Lee Byeong Gyu, he's good, too.

300
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,890
Oh, Yong Taek... he can be the center with his skill.

301
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,580
Thanks.

302
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,320
Hey, why don't you bring up my Jae Woo?

303
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,100
He can't even do the basic routine.

304
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,170
That's right. I think he will fail at the preliminary.

305
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,670
Let's separate work and personal things.

306
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,500
Hey! What will you do if he makes it?

307
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,110
Don't judge a person by his cover.

308
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,070
All right.

309
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,130
- The Director is coming for sure, right?
- I told you yes.

310
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,270
Anyway, let's totally shame her today.

311
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,070
She's dead.

312
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,470
Is school a playground? Director, resign!

313
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,020
Resign! Resign!

314
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,780
Director Jeong Gi Do must resign!

315
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,290
Resign! Resign!

316
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,760
What kind of school is this! The director should resign!

317
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,420
Resign! Resign!

318
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,040
Director who ignores student rights must resign!

319
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,080
Resign! Resign!

320
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,190
Come see me.

321
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,190
Of course I'll go.

322
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,540
It's tomorrow.

323
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,230
Director Park!

324
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,890
I'm really sorry. I was on my way, then something important came up.

325
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,450
I'm sorry.

326
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,450
It's fine, I was joking. Do you think I would've been waiting for you?

327
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,750
Oh, you didn't wait?

328
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,640
Am I stupid? To wait for someone so desperately who doesn't even like me?

329
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,230
You're not even denying it.

330
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,800
I just gave it to you.

331
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,060
Since I was able to find a new hobby with your help,

332
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,080
I was thankful.

333
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,270
I'm glad you didn't wait for me.

334
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,700
How was it? Did it go well? I was really curious.

335
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,620
Of course.

336
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,200
Ballerinas usually have a short career span.

337
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,930
When they're nearing their retirement, I heard they become very anxious and get depressed.

338
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,710
But, twenty years later? I want to do this.

339
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,680
I think it'll be more fun then.

340
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,180
No one is meant to die.

341
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,670
When you retire, you can look for something else to do.

342
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,080
Live simply. Take it easy.

343
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,270
You live simply.

344
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,930
A man who doesn't even know what he likes ...

345
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,860
Or is it denying it?

346
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,990
What are you saying?

347
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,250
You like that girl called Jin Joo.

348
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,660
I saw it all with my eyes.

349
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,890
You looked at me like you were my dad.

350
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,290
When you looked at her, you were all heart eyes.

351
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,960
Hey. You're the only one who doesn't know.

352
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,120
Does she not know, either?

353
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,310
Step down! Step down!

354
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,880
Director who ignores student rights must resign!

355
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,450
Step down! Step down!

356
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,200
They're protesting.

357
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,350
Step down! Step down!

358
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,280
The chief director?

359
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,810
Step down! Step down!

360
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,880
Step down!

361
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,870
Are you not feeling where?

362
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,250
No, it's not that.

363
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,140
You can leave first. I... excuse me.

364
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,930
What's the matter?

365
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,920
She won't give me a chance.

366
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,280
Resign! Resign!

367
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,090
Resign! Resign!

368
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,760
The director should step down!

369
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,740
Step down! Step down!

370
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,910
It's her!

371
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,180
Step down!

372
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,840
Resign!

373
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,750
What do I do?

374
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,850
Step down!

375
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,970
Just go!

376
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,790
Resign! Resign!

377
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,420
Don't come! Oh, just go!

378
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,170
Geez...

379
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,530
Why are they going that far...

380
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,990
The son is seeing all kinds of things...

381
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,100
What do I do... I feel so bad...

382
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,360
Resign! Step down!

383
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,090
Resign! Resign!

384
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,210
Resign!

385
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,880
Step down!

386
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,280
Resign!

387
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,300
Have you eaten already?

388
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,740
Let's eat together.

389
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,630
Resign! Resign!

390
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,190
Hiking food prices on campus! The director should explain!

391
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,630
How is such a young boy good at hiding his feelings?

392
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,400
Why aren't you eating?

393
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
Well, I'll eat all of it then.

394
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:17,280
Yes, okay. Eat up.

395
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,940
You don't really know how to express your feelings, right?

396
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,010
What?

397
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,910
If you're hurting, you don't show it. If you're sad, you don't show it. If you're angry, you don't show it.

398
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,730
It seems like you don't really express your feelings verbally.

399
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,760
Then, no one else can worry about you.

400
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,930
Why? You want to worry about me?

401
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,790
No one really worries about me.

402
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,430
So, it's fine.

403
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,490
I think they're over there...

404
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,180
What are you doing?

405
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,780
Stop it, it's hot!

406
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,380
Cover me.

407
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,440
If I get caught by those '94 liner brown bears, I'll be on my way to death.

408
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,310
I flipped him off to his face.

409
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:29,570
You crazy guy... you'll get it one of these days. Why are you so serious?

410
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,960
Isn't that Ma Jin Joo?

411
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,340
Where?

412
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,140
Go Dok Jae!

413
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,930
From my point of view, the only way left is to get on your knees and beg for forgiveness.

414
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,270
That's not the way. The way to heaven...

415
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:59,500
No, sit down. Save me. Don't go!

416
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,340
Hey, just tell them you got your draft notice.

417
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,250
You're crazy. "Draft notice?" That doesn't make sense. Hey!

418
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,380
Hi. We have something to talk about, right?

419
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,450
I'm so sorry. That time, I wasn't in my right mind.

420
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,170
Oh, you weren't? Well, you should've been in your right mind.

421
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,820
Why weren't you?

422
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,110
Oh, I... I got my draft notice.

423
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,540
Draft notice?

424
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,760
No, it wasn't a draft notice.

425
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,980
I did wrong, I... Ah!

426
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,600
Let's have a drink.

427
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,240
If you keep looking at me like that, I get excited.

428
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,010
This is called "Mom's smile," not "excited smile." Okay?

429
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,920
As expected, you're...

430
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,890
Nam Gil!

431
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,070
You're here?

432
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,090
After Secretary Kim contacted me, I came right away. What happened?

433
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,950
Is everything okay?

434
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,010
Yes, he's probably okay. You can contact him and leave.

435
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,630
Well, goodbye.

436
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:30,110
No, I wasn't talking about Dad. I was talking about you.

437
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,600
I was worried about you, so I came.

438
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,530
Are you okay?

439
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,400
So, he has two mothers.

440
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,670
Then, why would he say he had no one?

441
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,840

444
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,750
It's not here.

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,090
Is it out on loan?
[ Natural Science 647
Stephen Hawking

446
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,970
What are you looking for? Time slip?

447
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,540
I was just curious.

448
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,140
I don't think you'll need it. It didn't have much worthy content.

449
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,020
Oh, okay.

450
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,230
I was just curious, but I don't have to read it.

451
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,610
Well, I'll be going.

452
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,130
Okay.

453
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,340
What?

454
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,440
Oh, those young punks.

455
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,710
Just go. Why are we hiding?

456
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:25,130
If we leave now, it'll be weirder. And, they're cute.

457
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,460
Just wait. They'll end up leaving.

458
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,940
Hey! Why don't you bring up my Jae Woo?

459
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,460
He can't even get the basic moves down.

460
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,820
Yeah, that's true. I don't think we'll make it past the preliminaries.

461
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,400
Let's separate work and personal matters.

462
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,210
Listen to what I tell you to do!

463
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,060
I'm not doing it!

464
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm not doing it!

465
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,480
I'm not doing it!

466
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,960
The life of a soldier is in the angles.

467
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,040
- If you can have a good posture, you're halfway into the military life.
- Good posture.

468
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,310
I'll be sure to remember that.

469
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,530
Dok Jae. Every religion has different snacks they give you.

470
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,500
Some might give you two Choco Pies, but others might only give you one.

471
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,030
- So, you have to look at all of this before registering.
- Okay!

Punk, be sure to hang in there.

Being discharged might be like it's never going to happen, but it eventually does.

474
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,270
Of course. If I'm born as a Korean man...

475
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,780
It's just two years. You have to go and come back to be a man, right?

476
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,800
Go Dok Jae! You're manly. You're amazing.

477
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,840
Have a drink.

478
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,650
But, if I don't end up going, I'll be caught easily.

479
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,300
Do I have to cut my hair?

480
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,000
No, I can't.

481
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,120
Well, I survived today. I'll think about it tomorrow.

482
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,690
Hello? Oh, Mom.

483
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,980
Dok Jae. Your draft notice came in.

484
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,140
What are you saying? Draft notice? I'm only twenty.

485
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,000
Your birthday is early.

486
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,530
Are you being serious?

487
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,070
Go Dok Jae! Hurry up!

488
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,460
Come quickly.

489
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,740
Yes. Yes.

490
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,820
♫ Leaving home... ♫

491
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,720
It's my first time seeing a boy act so normal even after getting their draft notice. You haven't even cried.

492
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,500
That's true.

493
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,020
- That's true.
- Drink up.

494
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,480
♫ On the day to boot camp ♫
 Kim Kwang Seok's "The Private's Letter"

495
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,900
♫ I bowed to my parents ♫

496
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:14,870
♫ and stepped outside the door. ♫

497
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,360
I'll be going.

498
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,390
Ma Jin Joo!

499
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,260
Yeah?

500
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,590
That mark the ring made...

501
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,140
Since when was it there?

502
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,390
Since we came here.

503
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,370
Welcome.

504
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,700
I'm looking for a ring. It's a ring with a line on the inside of the finger.

505
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,670
Is this all?

506
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:08,000
♬  When I first saw you, we were awkward.  ♬

507
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,410
Inside the ring, there's a line...

508
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,090
Are these all the rings you have?

509
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,460
♫ It was enough to shake me up ♫

510
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,690
How about this?

511
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,660
It's a bit simple.

512
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,260
A neat one?

513
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
These are all the rings you have, right?

514
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,310
♫ It was like the white light of my heart ♫

515
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:36,250
I think it's here. Please...

516
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,910
Welcome.

517
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,510
I'm looking for a ring.
♫  I wanted to tell you.

518
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,340
♫  You're amazing.  ♫

519
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:49,130
♬  Baby, within your bright eyes,  ♬

520
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,310
This one's pretty. Let's do this one.

521
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,390
This one?

522
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,090
- Do you want me to show you this one?
- Yes.

523
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:00,040
♬  In that adorable voice of yours  ♬

524
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,150
♬  Like giving myself to the cold rain ♬

525
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,240
♬  I want to get soaking wet for you ♬

526
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,530
Seo Jin.

527
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Seo Jin.

528
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,770
Did you sleep?

529
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,230
I was going to go on a walk and was wondering if you wanted to go. Just sleep.

530
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,460
No, Mom. Go with me.

531
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,230
- Mom, being in your arms is the best.
- Oh, you.

532
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,670
Your acting adorable has been increasing lately.

533
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,880
Let's go.

534
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,910
What are you doing instead of eating?

535
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,000
- Huh?
- Eat slowly so you don't get an upset stomach.

536
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,010
Have this.

537
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,970
Oh, stop giving me these. You eat up, Mom.

538
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,460
I'll eat myself. Chew well and eat.

539
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,000
I'll figure it out and eat by myself.

540
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,770
Eat up.

541
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,900
It's good.

542
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,870
Where should we go?

543
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,170
The park?

544
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,250
- Should we?
- Yeah.

545
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:55,010
The stepmother seems like a good person to Nam Gil.

546
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,880
Yeah, it seems like that. But, I don't think he knows because he's too young.

547
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,280
It can be because of his biological mother.

548
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,150
You said he's an upperclassman.

549
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,010
Oh, yeah. He is.

550
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,070
Whether it's his real mom or whoever is holding him...

551
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:15,780
He doesn't see those next to him who truly look out and care for him.

552
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,880
But, that young boy has divorced parents. He must've gone through a lot.

553
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,570
What?

554
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:32,530
Mom. If I ever get married and get a divorce,

555
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,880
what would you say?

556
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,260
I wouldn't send you off to a boy who'd be so strange that you'd want a divorce with him.

557
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:46,570
Do you think I'm always happy with your dad?

558
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,310
But do you think your dad is always happy with me?

559
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:55,200
If you think like that, you take it as is.

560
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,200
How can you live picking on every detail?

561
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:04,840
True. There's probably a lot of things the other person wouldn't like about me.

562
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,650
You? You have a very unusual personality.

563
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,910
Even though it's gotten decent lately.

564
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:27,210
Would it have been easier to live if you were by my side?

565
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:33,880
Your mom's right by your side. Is there anything easy in life?

566
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,760
Everyone lives through trial and error.

567
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,770
What are you looking at?

568
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,570
What did you say?

569
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,070
Are you looking down on me, too? Huh?

570
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,640
Are you looking down on me?

571
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,420
Move aside.

572
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,710
Don't look down on me. I'm a human, too.

573
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,000
Mister!

574
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,700
Let go, let go! Just because I'm being weak trying to make a living...

575
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,580
You think I'm no better than a dog, huh?

576
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,350
I am

577
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:25,980
a human, too! I'm not a dog!

578
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:32,190
What more can I do?

579
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,590
I'm having a really tough time.

580
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,420
Don't look down on me!

581
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,910
I'm really trying!

582
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,170
He must have it so hard. So hard...

583
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,210
I'm really trying!

584
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:59,280
I'm trying my best!

585
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,660
How can I do more?

586
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,080
How can I?

587
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,120
How about me? Do you even know what I go through outside?

588
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:20,700
I'm worse off than a dog. I'm being treated less than a dog. You have no idea how I live...

589
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,500
Do you know?

590
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,870
Why am I like this?

591
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:32,720
I have never been insincere. Not even once...

592
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,570
I really tried so hard.

593
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,580
I worked so hard wanting to live well.

594
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,610
Why am I always sorry and apologizing?

595
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,510
Don't look down on me!

596
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,850
I'm really trying!

597
00:47:53,850 --> 00:48:00,540
I'm trying, too.

598
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,630
I am.

599
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,980
What are you doing instead of coming in?

600
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,500
Mom. You're not going to send me off to just anyone for marriage, right?

601
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,810
No matter how much I insist, you'll be choosy, right, Mom?

602
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,340
Why say something so obvious? Would I marry you off to just anyone just because you insist?

603
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:37,050
I'm going to choose the right boy for you to marry. A boy who won't make you cry.

604
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,600
Mom, go in first. I have to go see someone.

605
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,780
Hey, Jin Joo!

606
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,410
That girl..

607
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:05,330
♬  We can never turn around nor go back.  ♬

608

♬  We two who only have the same dream.  ♬

609
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:21,030
♬  The farther we're apart, the closer we become.  ♬

610
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,150
♬  Is it my  ♬

611
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,150
I didn't want to make you cry.

612
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,800
I just wanted you to laugh.

613
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:34,020
To just laugh.

614
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:42,570
Whether it's his real mother or whoever is holding onto him... he can't see the person who's really taking care of him by his side.

615
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:50,470
♬  When I dream of you in the days where my heart hurts.  ♬

616
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:57,770
♬  When I dream of you, you and I who lost our paths.  ♬

617

♬  You were so kind, we used to be so brilliant and bright.  ♬

618
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,370
Hello?

619
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,800
Where are you right now?

620
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,030
What?

621
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,610
I'm crying right now.

622
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,070
Am I going to cry by myself again?

623
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,650
Don't cry. I'll go to you.

624
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,780
I'll go. Stay where you are.

625
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:35,950
♬  I pray for the dream, which you are.  ♬

626
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,840
What is this, again?

627
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,860
Thank you.

628
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:58,280
Thank you for saving Jin Joo.

629
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,540
What is he saying?

630
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,640
What is this? Why is he thankful?

631
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,980

♬  Come to me the way you are.  ♬

♬  Even if time is turned back,  ♬

Get up!

Honey!
♫ which won't change ♫

Only if I knew then what I know now

657
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:00,770
We probably wouldn't have to be here

Epilogue

660
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,580
Why are you getting off? You can go.

661
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,320
Okay. Rest well.

662
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,570
You can go. Thank you.

663
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,630
What are you doing?

664
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,090
Why are you here?

665
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:57,240
Why'd you get here so late? You left earlier than I did.

666
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,900
We didn't even stop to rest while driving. That's weird.

667
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,100
You get in a man's car so easily like that.

668
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,320
He only recently got his driver's license. What if he gets into an accident? So dangerous...

669
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,480
You're worried for nothing.

670
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,780
Do you feel like breathing now that you got to see the ocean?

671
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:27,580
Yeah. It's been so long since we went on a vacation.

672
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,440
I can't even remember where we went for our last vacation.

673
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,490
Don't you think we're like that, too?

674
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,560
What is?

675
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,260
Maybe we're just here on a short vacation.

676
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,540
A break.

677
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,240
That makes sense.

678
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,970
God felt sorry for us and sent us on a trip.
