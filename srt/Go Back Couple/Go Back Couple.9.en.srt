[1999 In reality after the meeting between History & Civil Construction Majors]

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,020
Follow the arrows.

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,580
♫  When I first saw you, ♫

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,610
♫  We were a bit awkward. ♫

5
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,580
♫  A bit awkward. ♫

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,070
♬  The smile in your eyes  ♬

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,440
♬  was enough to shake me  ♬

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,020
There aren't any more arrows. Did someone try to joke around?

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,570
♬  It was like a pure white light. ♬

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,380
Hi.

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,780
It's Choi Ban Do, the civil construction major from the meeting. Do you want to watch a movie?

12
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,620
♬  I said you were wonderful.  ♬

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,260
At the time we did not figure it out

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,060
While being faithful to our heart's response

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,670
Our entire universe revolved around each other.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,510
- Why can't I see you off?
-  You can't. You also have to catch the last train right away.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,200
You should get going quickly today.

18
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,090
Hey! How'd you get here?

19
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,500
- I rode a taxi because I got something I wanted to give you.
- What?

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,160
I wanted to see you, so this worked out well. Right?

21
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,520
Let's see what your excuse is.

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,730
Choi Ban Do, are you okay?

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,050
Hey, what's this? Your skin's already having a reaction. Why would you buy these?

24
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,080
Hey, who's the one that likes them? My allergy doesn't matter.

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,150
I guess you'll end up picking the stars for me, too, then.

26
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,090
I can't because I can't reach them. But, if i could, I'd pick all the stars for you.

27
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,150
- Let's go.
- I really can't live.

28
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,040
- Do you have money for the taxi fare?
- No.
- Then, how are you going to go home?

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,260
Walking will be fine. My leg is okay to use anywhere.

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,810
The times we had when we wanted to pick stars and moons.

31
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,610
Where did those feelings end up disappearing to?
 Petition for Divorce

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,400
Where are we standing right now?

Episode 9: The Times We Loved

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Why am I here?

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,580
Choi Ban Do! Get up!

36
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,450
Ma Jin Joo.

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,720
Huh?

38
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,980
I'm back, right?

39
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,510
What about Seo Jin?

40
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,400
Are you really not going to get sober?

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm not drunk. The dream I had...

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,200
Jin Joo? Ma Jin Joo!

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,330
Honey!

44
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,590
Honey.

45
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,460
Hey, wake up! Are you not going to school?

46
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,350
The dude is just a baby.

47
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,900
- Mom. Take me with you to the mineral spring this weekend.
- Okay.

48
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,660
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,860
It seems like she's doing a lot of things with you lately. As if she's stuck to you like gum.

50
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,020
That's right. Tell me about it.

51
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,310
This weekend will be busy with climbing to the mineral spring.

52
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,480
Let's bring Eun Joo, too.

53
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,110
It's not you. She said she wanted to go with me.

54
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,440
- So, without me?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,870
Why are you leaving me out? Don't. I want to go!

56
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,160
If the needle goes, the thread has to go along with it, too.  (T/N: Meaning the dad and mom have to stick together like a pair.) 
Are you hers? You're mine!

57
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,280
Really.

58
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,210
After the IMF, the suicide rate for those in their 20s is increasing. "Mom, thank you for giving birth to me, but times are too hard."

59
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,800
You endured a lot while giving birth to me, Mom.

60
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,480
No way.

61
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,090
Mom, what are you doing?

62
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,300
Hey. Look at this.

63
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,700
-She's strange.
- What?

64
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,410
What? She wrote a letter to you.

65
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,400
You don't think it's a suicide note, right?

66
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,710
A suicide note? Are you crazy? Wow, your imagination.

67
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,670
Then, would she have written it only for you? It's almost your birthday, so she probably wrote it for you.

68
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,260
- Oh, my birthday.
- Mom, just give me food.

69
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,050
I know she's your daughter and all, but why are you searching her room like that?

70
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,960
So, what? This house is mine. What would I not be able to search?

71
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,790
Hi. Are you going to school?

72
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,450
Well, yes. It's not like I have anywhere else to go at this time.

73
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,630
Get in. I'm going to school, too.

74
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,040
Uhmm

75
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,950
She has her own driver?

76
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,660
Anyway, did that trash pay for it with nothing? Bad Jerk.

77
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,060
I'm thankful for what happened before.

78
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,290
Oh, it's nothing. I got my revenge, too.

79
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,360
Did Park Hyeon Seok cause you to suffer, too?

80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
I wonder if there is a person other than me. When I think of that bastard, even if I'm sleeping, I wake up.

81
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,920
Just trying to make a decent living ... The young kid that I was ...

82
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,990
Don't suffer because of him anymore.

83
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,150
No, that's not it. If I want to feed my family, I have to earn money.

84
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,130
I'll make it so that you don't suffer because of him.

85
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,640
I can make it so that you don't suffer.

86
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,060
Why is she like this? Why is she being coy? Don't do that.

87
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,070
So, have your feelings recovered?

88
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,230
Yes, thanks to you.

89
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,330
- I'm going to the bathroom. - Alright.

90
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,080
- I'll pay for it.
- Hey.

91
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,530
In celebration of your new life, I'll pay for it.
Auntie, I'll pay now.

92
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,350
Okay. Oh, my! What do I do?

93
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,410
Hey, hey. You'll get hurt.

94
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,350
Oh, who did this? This was from Thailand.

95
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,320
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, Auntie. I was going to touch it a little and then it fell over.

96
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,430
Thirteen years from now, I'll be traveling to Thailand for work. When that time comes, I'll buy you the same one. I promise.

97
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,820
Say it in plain language.

98
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,580
Better clean it up quickly.

99
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,980
Ah, this is a bit uncomfortable.

100
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,820
Sunbae says don't say it's too difficult.

101
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,640
I'm not a woman who''s biased against a so-called older woman-younger man relationship.

102
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,050
Pardon?

103
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,260
Ah, yes.

104
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,610
Do you, by any chance, have a girlfriend?

105
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,460
Pardon?

106
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,460
I don't have one.

107
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,940
Welcome, Hospital Director!

108
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,390
You worked hard. You put in a lot of effort.

109
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,070
Today somehow I want to eat the tropical fruit Durian.

110
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,290
- I'll buy it quickly!
- Ooh!

111
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,370
Are you not going already?

112
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,790
- Madam has arrived.
How are you, Madam.

113
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,930
Honey!

114
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,260
Oh, no, no.

115
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,020
Huh? What?

116
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,660
Oh, no, it's nothing. You can get going.

117
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,800
Come to your senses! Choi Ban Do, you can earn as much as you want. Of course!

118
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,810
Ma Jin Joo?

119
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,210
Did she see me? Wait, it's not like I did anything wrong.

120
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,210
Why am I avoiding her?

121
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,020
What was that?

122
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,690
You have to look where you're going! Gosh.

123
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,570
Are your eyes just there for decoration?

124
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,810
Oh, gosh! What do I do?

125
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,410
I'm so sorry! What do I do?

126
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,670
Where do you think you're touching?

127
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,270
You. Do you know how much this is?

128
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,500
You can't even buy it if you sell your body. Did you know?

129
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,610
Hey!

130
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,640
Hey?

131
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,390
How could you say things like that to a kid?

132
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,680
How much was it? Was it more expensive than a person? You don't even know what she'll be when she's older.

133
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,110
What are you? Glaring at me with those eyes.. You're younger than my son!

134
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,410
Between people who raise children,

135
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,340
if you think your son is precious, you have to know that others' children are precious, too.

136
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,150
Thanks too women like you, good moms in Korea are called "Mom Gangster"!

137
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,630
Mom... Mom Gangster?

138
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,620
Hey, ever since earlier, why have you continually been speaking informally to me? You!

139
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,180
No, this isn't it. Why are you doing this to your mom?

140
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,130
I didn't do it. She did!

141
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,120
Let go!

142
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,150
What's up with you? To your mom?

143
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,980
I didn't do it!

144
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,160
She did it first to me! To me, your mom!

145
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,700
I didn't do anything wrong!

146
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,440
Why are you doing this to me?

147
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,670
Uh, thank you.

148
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,400
Oh, it's nothing.

149
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,620
It's because I can't stand watching something like that happen but...

150
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,240
Anyone can love...
Humans and Philosophy

151
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,780
But not everyone can succeed in love."

152
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,100
An American psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich Fromm said, "Love

153
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,430
is not an emotion easily attached by anyone without

154
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,900
being mature."

155
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,280
If you want to fulfill your love, your entire being

156
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,780

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,580
The pigs will be sad if we don't eat pork belly while we're on a trip.

314
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,970
But, how many  geun  is all this?  (T/N: Geun = 1.3 lbs or 600g)

315
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,860
One  geun  per person. Since boys eat a lot, boys get two  geun  each. Nine  geun  in total.

316
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,130
- What?
- Nine  geun?

317
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,780
Did the ghost who died from not eating any meat get stuck on you guys?

318
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,740
There would still be leftovers with just three  geun.  Who's going to eat all of this?

319
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,630
Isn't one  geun  one serving?

320
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,860
You didn't just buy meat, did you?

321
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,170
Of course not. What do you see us as?

322
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,060
Soup.

323
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,260
Okay, let's just eat meat until our stomachs explode.

324
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,640
Our stomachs will be so surprised.

325
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,000
Let's eat!

326
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,550
Just wait a little more.

327
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,380
Okay. This is a time for you guys to eat a lot.

328
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,010
Done! Eat up!

329
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,170
It's hot!

330
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,410
Wow!

331
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,110
Wow, Choi Ban Do.

332
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,440
- Let's do cheers.
- Cheers!

333
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,250
We made a good decision coming here to have fun. I'm so happy.

334
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,570
Open wide.

335
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,800
♫ Now, wipe your tears away ♫

336
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,580
♫ The heaven is blessing us ♫

337
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,400
♫ Whoa, whoa, whoa, like this ♫

338
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,100
♬  With a bright smile, you're with me ♬

339
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,960

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:38,710
♬  A love that no one knows of. ♬

344
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,340
Wow, so cool!

345
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,110
Closing bow!

346
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,420
♬  When I look at you in the eyes, ♬

347

♬  everything seems like a dream. ♬

♬  Among all of the people in this world, ♬

349
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,490
♬  how did it end up being the two of us?

350
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,480
♬  I don't know, it could've been a miracle. ♬

351
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,300
♬  When I am in your arms, ♬

352
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,880
♬  You awaken a new side to me  ♬

353
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,970
♬  Before I knew you, ♬

354
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,870
♬  I don't know how I lived. ♬

355
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:41,160
♬  I don't know if I was dead before then. ♬

356
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,820
♫ How could we have missed each other like this ♫

357
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,760
♬  We were so close. ♬

358
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,410
♬  The time we have to love each other is not enough. ♬

359
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,250
♬  We can neither turn around nor go back. ♬

360
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:27,590
♬  We only have the same dream. ♬

361
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:36,740
♬  The farther apart we get, the closer we become. ♬

362
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,840
♬  Is it my feelings towards you? ♬

363
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:52,120
♬  Like the last dream I dreamt, ♬

364
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:59,440
♬  if I could turn back time ♬

365

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:29,920
♬  Like a short dream, very faintly, ♬

369
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:37,270
♬  You're far away like a small star. ♬

370
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,650
What a mess...

371
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,710
Hey, wake them up.

372
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,130
Hey, wake up!

373
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,500
Wake up, what are you doing?

374
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
How could they use our building materials...

375
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,340
Hurry, wake up.

376
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,450
What are you doing right now?

377
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,780
What are you doing here?

378
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,850
I'm very sorry.

379
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,500
What are you guys doing? Put all of this away quickly.

380
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,380
I'm very sorry!

381
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,180
What?

382
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,560
What the? Hey!

383
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,400
Jin Joo, wake up!

384
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,540
Hey, what's on your face?

385
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,230
What's up with you?

386
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,130
Wow, they're really childish.

387
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,340
Hey, what is this?

388
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,050
Choi Ban Do, you elementary school kid!

389
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,410
Wow, what a great piece of work.

390
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,660
Your portrait. That's exactly how you look when you get angry.

391
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,540
You begger-like rascal, I should just--

392
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,770
Hey, look at that. Is it the same?

393
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,130
Hey, why are you removing it?

394
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,540
Hey, but that's really funny.

395
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,910
Don't laugh!

396
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,100
Hey, just look at yourself in the mirror. Yours is funnier.

397
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,850
Hey! Why are you removing it?

398
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,280
Are you leaving now?

399
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,710
Yes.

400
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,950
You always look cool.

401
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,970
By the way, is school alright?

402
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,510
I heard there was talk about your father's resignation.

403
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,290
He fell into the rotting water he created.

404
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,780
What?

405
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,280
He'd stick around even if he becomes filthy. Don't worry.

406
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,840
It's not that, but.

407
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,740
What is this? Let go!

408
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,090
Hey, let go!

409
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,090
Are you not letting go?
Oh, my!

410
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,000
I should've yanked her hair. Because of you...

411
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,430
If that family tries to take even a penny out of my son's money...

412
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,610
I'll just! Ugh.

413
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,540
Get off.

414
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,000
Drive to Cheongdam-dong.

415
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,120
Is your hobby picking up trash you already threw away?

416
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,490
What are you saying?

417
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:36,240
Why am I your son? If you threw away trash already, don't pick it up again.

418
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,450
It's dirty.

419
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,060
What?

420
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,680
Gosh, seriously...

421
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,980
Do you think I just came here? I came with a present.

422
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,730
- Dok Jae.
- Yeah?

423
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,830
- Look next to you.
- Next to me?

424
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,560
The ocean!! The ocean!

425
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,320
Wow!!

426
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,020
It's so pretty!

427
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,390
Wow, it's so pretty.

428
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,840
Wow, those waves!

429
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,400
Wow, I love it!

430
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,990
Wow!

431
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,920
We're arriving soon!

432
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,870
Scream!

433
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:35,750
♬  It gives me a moment of respite ♬

434
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,750
♬ Breathing within me ♬

435
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,730
♬  Beyond the hill ♬

436
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:49,420
♬  to the place into the fantasy where you will welcome me ♬

437
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,110
Jin Joo, what are you doing there, not coming in?

438
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,020
I'm fine, you can just play!

439
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,910
♬  Deep in the heart of the young me who sleeps is the day's dream ♬

440
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:07,710
♬  If you can provide it as well as you see it ♬

441
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,140
Aw, they're so young.

442
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,660
♬  If it feels like every day has no meaning. ♬

443
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:19,390
♬  Find your dream and let it start now. Hey, hey, hey! ♬

444
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,440
The bathroom door's locked.

445
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,300
I didn't even wash up today.

446
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,270
You guys don't even get washed at home, but you do when you're out here.

447
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,930
Just wash yourself here.

448
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,530
Yeah, just wash yourself here. There's no other place to.

449
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,170
You're all dead!

450
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,850
Hey, don't do it!

451
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,920
Agh, don't do it!

452
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,140
Don't do it!

453
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,940
Don't do it.

454
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,900
Wow!

455
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,170
Sorry.

456
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,640
You guys are all dead!

457
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,040
Hey!!

458
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,570
Hey, what is this?

459
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,170
♫ I walked in the rain ♫

460
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,420
♬  The path I walked with you ♬

461
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,740
♫ The stories of the past that I remember ♫

462
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:44,540
♬  Is it a memory?♬

463
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,710
♬  Come back to me. ♬

464
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,960
♬  To me, who's waiting. ♬

465
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,520
♫ This cold rain, you're the only one ♫

466
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,330
♬  It can be stopped. ♬

467
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,880
Honey, here's water.

468
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:16,930
Are you not tired?

469
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,270
We come every day. Why do you ask if I'm tired every day?

470
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,820
I'm perfectly fine.

471
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,850
Anyway, is she having fun?

472
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:30,100
Since she's on a trip, she should play her heart out. Why come home tomorrow?

473
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,050
- She has to go to school.
- Oh, gosh.

474
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,820
No one's going to die from missing a day of school. Kids should have fun.

475
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,270
Ah, that's true.

476
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,380
- It's our turn now.
- Okay.

477
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,130
Sir? Do you not see the line here?

478
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,200
It's my turn now.

479
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,460
You should've gotten here faster! You came late, so that's why I'm here first.

480
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,920
It took me ten seconds to get from there to here.

481
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,270
Why are you saying I didn't come fast enough?

482
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,740
Ten seconds? 1 second, 2 second, 3 second.

483
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,270
If it's 10 seconds, it's long enough to fill up the can halfway.

484
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,550
You can have it first.

485
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,130
Honey, it won't even take long for us.

486
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,210
Honey, what are you doing? Did you cut in line again?

487
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,060
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

488
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,830
What do you mean cut in line?

489
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:22,930
Let go of me.

490
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,990
Look. There are rules and order even at the spring water site.

491
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,950
If you come out alone to get water, you should put out the bucket in a proper and orderly manner.

492
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,040
What kind of arrogant ahjussi are you?

493
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,390
What? Arrogant?

494
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,900
How dare you, woman! To a man?

495
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,150
What? What did you just say? A woman?

496
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,460
How dare you talk to her like that?

497
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,110
Oh, my! Why are you grabbing his neck, Ahjussi?

498
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,090
You punk!

499
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,940
Are you not letting go?

500
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,020
Let go, please!

501
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,650
I'm so sorry!

502
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,270
How dare you grab my neck?

503
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,850
I bet your child will be learning from those good actions of yours.

504
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,140
- Aigoo, my neck muscle!
- Hey!

505
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,880
Argh!

506
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,810
Raise your own kid right.

507
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,140
I'd be afraid to get a son-in-law like you, you old man!

508
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,820
You woman! How dare you throw water at me!

509
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,280
I'd be afraid to get a daughter-in-law like you.

510
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,190
- Honey, are you okay?
- Hey!

511
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,380
You!

512
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,160
♫  It rained that day too. ♫

513
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,380
♬  The day that left me. ♬

514
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,870
♫  With the rain that falls, if your heart ♫

515
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,570
♫  is crying ♫

516
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,970
♫ This cold rain, you're the only one ♫

517
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,990
♬  who can stop it. ♬

518
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,580
Is it here?

519
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,340
Isn't that Nam Gil there?

520
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,960
Why is he here?

521
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,970
Wow, this is too fate-like to be called a coincidence.

522
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,170
Did you call him?

523
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,970
Me? Why would I?

524
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,120
Oh, I called him.

525
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,010
What?

526
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,020
I'm sorry. Something important suddenly came up.

527
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,390
But still, how can you not show up at a sunbae's military wedding ceremony?

528
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,920
It was a mess trying to look for your stand-in.

529
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,190
I'll pay for the food. I'm really sorry.

530
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,680
Ilwon, Gangreung

531
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,560
Our town attraction
Firefly

532
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,800
I don't have a mom. Mind your own business.

533
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,350
Oh, it's all dried. It dried fast.

534
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,610
Your eyes will rip open.

535
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,950
It's nice if we all hang out together.

536
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,540
I know, right?

537
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:47,480
Why'd you suddenly call him? Don't tell me you like him?

538
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,730
You want me to get you two introduced?

539
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,510
Me? No, I don't like him.

540
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:56,440
He likes her.

541
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,180
He came as fast as he could after he knew Jin Joo was here.

542
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:06,020
- Oh, you! Why would you say that?
- Oh, you.

543
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,910
Would he want to come here looking like that?

544
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,040
Over there, there... shouldn't I take a picture of him and report him to the reserve officers training corp?

545
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,090
That he's going around muddying up the water.

546
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,890
He looks great. That's what you call a uniform fantasy.

547
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,870
What kind of genre is uniform fantasy?

548
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,370
Tada!

549
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,620
Wow, what's up with them? Are you guys going to kindergarten?

550
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,480
Do you not think of those who look at you? You guys are the ones wearing it, but we have to look at you.

551
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,930
Hey. Do you want to fight?

552
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,310
No.

553
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:48,950
- Hey, this was so hard to get. He's just jealous. Right?
- Yeah.

554
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,820
Hey. We still have two more left for tomorrow. Do you want it?

555
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,040
No.

556
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,280
It's cooked.

557
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,480
Wow, it looks good!

558
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,440
Ooh, it was cooked well.

559
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,330
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

560
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,420
Why did you come here in such an uncomfortable outfit?

561
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,530
It's uncomfortable for the people who look at you, too.

562
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,720
It's not uncomfortable at all.

563
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,190
Me, too.

564
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,670
I wanted to get some air. I felt stuffy.

565
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,290
You sure did come far just to get some air.

566
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:45,480
But why are you speaking so casually to someone much older than you? Call him hyungnim.

567
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,790
Are you crazy? I'm much more of a hyung than he is.

568
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,380
- He's gone crazy now.
- Crazy.

569
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,230
It's okay. I don't care much for those I don't have to care about.

570
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,550
You don't care much about me?

571
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,780
Why is that? You're in the spot to be caring a lot about me.

572
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,870
When you find out the truth, you're going to care so much that you'll go crazy.

573
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,540
Hey!

574
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,040
I mean.

575
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,710
You. You can't be like that to a guest I invited.

576
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,350
Yeah. I know, right?

577
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,580
But, your clothes do look like they're uncomfortable.

578
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,610
Yeah. Do you not have clothes to change into?

579
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,930
No, it's okay. I've worn it a lot, so I'm comfortable.

580
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,240
You know, when you wear it like that, you do look cool.

581
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,640
- You're handsome, too.
- Thanks.

582
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,010
Does a man live off of his looks? Give me that in front of you.

583
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,930
What? This?

584
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,610
Not that. The thing next to it.

585
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,110
What?

586
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,030
You know, this is really nice. It's my first time coming to Gangneung.

587
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,540
Really?

588
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,870
Then, it's the first time we came together to Gangneung.

589
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,690
Ow, it hurts.

590
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,210
Have you been to Gangneung before?

591
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,700
I don't know. I don't remember.

592
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,570
Hey, hey, so clumsy.

593
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,250
Gosh, I just dried these clothes. It's okay! It'll dry quickly.

594
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,880
Yeah, but it'll smell like beer.

595
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,840
Yeah, it'll smell. This isn't going to work out.

596
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,760
Tada! Wear this at least.

597
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,280
Yeah.

598
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,620
I'll have it washed for you tomorrow.

599
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,110
Oh, I'll wear that, too.

600
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,370
My uniform's really uncomfortable.

601
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,240
Right? That's what I thought.

602
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,650
Hey!

603
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,140
I want to wear it.

604
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,980
Why? Your clothes have dried.

605
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,110
My clothes must've shrunk in the water earlier. It's uncomfortable.

606
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,650
Let go.

607
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,090
Don't you see that I look more uncomfortable than you?

608
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:25,180
If you're that uncomfortable, you should loosen that tie of yours.

609
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,210
Are you not going to let go? Let go. Aren't you going to let go?

610
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,500
Then, you could just wear mine.

611
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,110
I'm wearing this.

612
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,340
I'm going to cry.

613
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,800
Wow, seriously...

614
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,300
Wow, this is the best.

615
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,560
Looks good...

616
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,220
My love

617
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,420
This is really great, right?

618
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,880
Yeah. It's great.

619
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,210
- Thanks.
- For what?

620
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:34,200
Just, everything. If you hadn't found me, I would've just taken time off from school and regretted it for the rest of my life.

621
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,790
I wouldn't even have any memory to think of later. All this will be my memory.

622
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,810
I think I made the right decision by coming to university.

623
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:44,740
Yeah, that's why I'm trying to make a lot of memories.

624
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:50,390
For when I get old later, I'll pack away a ton of memories so I can continue to take them out of my memory and not get bored.

625
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,860
- I'll be in there, too.
- Great.

626
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,660
What is this? Why are you leaving me out?

627
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,840
Include me! What is it?

628
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,280
You're already included.

629
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,930
Why are you putting yourself in here?

630
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,820
If you're done getting some air, you should go home.

631
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,210
The others said it was fine.

632
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,330
You're the only one opposing it. It's six to one.

633
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,730
Seriously...

634
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:22,400
♫  I get one step closer. ♫

635
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,610
♫  Like that, I keep smiling. ♫

636
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,320
Hey, come fast and stick by us!

637
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,380
Why? You're a fantastic couple. Can't you just give them the shirts?

638
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,750
It fits you guys so well. Just keep it.

639
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,190
You can just keep it.

640
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,420
I don't want it!

641
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,470
They like it.

642
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,470
They're still sticking together.

643
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,930
Hey, couple!

644
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,250
Eat up!

645
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,250
- You can have it first.
- Eat it.

646
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:12,240
How pitiful! It doesn't even have a head.

647
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,790
Or a tail. Shrimp, are you okay?

648
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,520
Let's eat all of the pitiful shrimps.

649
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:33,490
No, you can't take this one!

650
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:38,820
Oh, but there aren't any appetizers.

651
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,240
What do you mean? You have appetizers right in front of you! The shrimp snacks and the peanuts! Eat those.

652
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,070
Shrimp, you're so pitiful.

653
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,280
I'm the most pitiful! Me!

654
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,530
You always do this when someone else is washing up.

655
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:04,060
What are you saying? You're the one who comes in when I'm about to wash up.

656
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,080
You must be happy.

657
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,130
Kids like that have only their good looks to show for. There's no depth there.

658
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:17,420
Don't you remember millionaire celebrity instructor Jeong Nam Gil?

659
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,580
Jung Nam Gil?

660
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,270
Hey, would you look at that.

661
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,750
He reads history to you, Jeong Nam Gil!

662
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,210
Hey, hey. He used to like me.

663
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,230
Oh, really? You're free to be delusional.

664
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,080
I'm being serious!

665
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,600
60 billion won a year... Jeong Nam Gil!

666
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,780
Wow, I envy him.

667
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,670
It's true. Jung Nam Gil, the history major.

668
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:55,830
Wow, Ma Jin Joo. You're smart. Is that why you seduced him? Because he's rich?

669
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,440
He always liked me first.

670
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,870
He lacks nothing and even has good taste. Don't you think?

671
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:16,550
And what? Seduce him because he's rich? Speak for yourself.

672
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,280
You were talking crap about Director Park.

673
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,580
What are you saying?

674
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,800
You looked good together. A handsome couple.

675
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,150
Hey! It's not that!

676
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,920
I'm lining up, oh, my, oh, my!

677
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,750
Hey, why are you watching TV when we came here to have fun?

678
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:53,170
Hey, but of all places, why Gangreung?

679
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,310
There's a reason.

680
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:56,580
Hey, are you going somewhere?

681
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,630
Yeah. Oh, have you seen Ma Jin Joo anywhere?

682
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,710
No, I don't know.

683
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,890
Have you seen Jin Joo by any chance?

684
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,440
- She said she was going to take a walk around the neighborhood and left.
- Oh, I see.

685
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,220
What are you doing?

686
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,570
I was looking around the neighborhood.

687
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:38,750
Ah, I see. You should look a bit longer. I want to walk, too.

688
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,640
There were a lot of stars in the past.

689
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,010
Is it because this is the countryside?

690
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:54,720
Uh. In the past, I was a bit...

691
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,460
Oh, "I don't have a mom. Mind your own business." That?

692
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,220
Hey, when did I-? I didn't say it like that.

693
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,010
Since he's so tall, I thought he was all grown up. But he's still tumultuous at heart, this student.

694
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,390
I was being truthful when I said to mind your own business.

695
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,250
Wasn't it false when you said you didn't have a mom?

696
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,470
How could there be someone without a mom in this world?

697
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:18,630
Whether she's on the other side of the earth or in heaven, she's somewhere.

698
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,170
Are you Park Hyeokgeose or something? Were you born from an egg?

699
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,680
Everyone has their own story.

700
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,930
Yeah, that's true. Can there be a household without a story?

701
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:34,520
While you can see and touch them, you have to give them a lot of love.

702
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:39,710
(T/N Park Hyeogeose was the founding king of the Silla Dynasty)

703
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,110
You'll be the only one losing out later.

704
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:01,960
Hey, you've started to talk informally to me. Same with that kid.

705
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,910
Oh, this neighborhood is pretty.

706
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,150
Look over there, please.

707
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,320
It's pretty.

708
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,430
I think we came too far. There doesn't seem to be a path here.

709
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,020
That's true.

710
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,790
Let's go.

711
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,800
There's something there.

712
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,280
Why are you doing this? It's scary.

713
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,680

- Do it quickly.
- You do it.

Go Back Couple Episode 10 Preview

775
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,390
Jin Joo, you have to meet a good person this time and be happy.

776
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,610
You're still young.

777
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,470
Is Yoon Bo Reum a cultural heritage or something?
Why protect her?

778
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,460
I'm going to protect you!

779
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:03,020
Do you think there's a guarantee that Mom will be by our side all the time?

Don't regret it later on.

Are you okay?

This chronic disease won't go away.

It's what I heard from the kids in the medical major.

784
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,050
