=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,680
Naughty again.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Fresh tribute from the Western Regions.

23
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,239
Have a taste.

24
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,480
Is it sweet?

25
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,120
No grape could be sweeter than you.

26
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,680
Fine things

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,520
should be shared.

28
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,520
How's this degree?

29
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:28,800
Still bearable.

30
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,520
He's here.

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,439
What are you doing?

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,280
What are we doing?

33
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,159
Can't you see?

34
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,159
His Majesty has issued a decree.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
You'll soon be my woman.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,479
How could you be so shameless?

37
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,560
Regent,

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
don't you forget

39
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,120
what you promised me.

40
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,400
Submit to me obediently.

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,719
I'll let you keep this male consort.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,759
Cheng Ziru,

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
you're a scholar after all.

44
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,952
Have you no shame at all?

45
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,199
Since I'm a male consort,

46
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,919
what use is shame then?

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,400
Moreover,

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,280
romantic company and fair ladies

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,199
have always been refined pursuits.

50
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,039
Besides, Her Majesty hasn't

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
married you yet.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,280
Even if I marry him,

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
you'll still belong to me.

54
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
He formally granted you to me.

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,664
Don't even think of escaping.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,199
Just you wait.

58
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,522
=Episode 19=

59
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,560
(Xuanming Palace)

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,680
The border wars remain stalemated.

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,400
Since Your Majesty decreed the marriage
between the Regent

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680
and the Empress Dowager,

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,639
it's best to hold the ceremony swiftly

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,879
to bless the realm,

65
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,879
ensuring our dynasty's eternal peace.

66
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,319
Well said.

67
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,680
How could I neglect such importance?

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,720
Your Majesty,

69
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,480
regarding yesterday's
divine consultation,

70
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,240
should we inform the ministers?

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,800
What divine consultation?

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,319
About your wedding
to the Empress Dowager.

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,120
Ministers,

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,399
to dispel the ominous celestial signs,

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,959
I visited Astrological Bureau
with the Empress Dowager

76
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,000
to consult the oracle.

77
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,399
Unexpectedly,

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
all auspicious dates

79
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:51,920
showed Yin hexagram omens.

80
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,800
The Yin hexagram indicates misfortune.

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,279
It's ill-omened.

82
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,680
I asked Heaven for guidance.

83
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,480
Yet this time,

84
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,759
a Yang response emerged.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,519
Heaven told me

86
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,720
unclear circumstances exist,

87
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,600
thus requiring postponement.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,639
Ominous signs remained.

89
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,360
I couldn't just stop.

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,639
Thinking it over,

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,879
I consulted again,

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,600
asking whether border conflicts
had caused the delay

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
of the wedding.

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,240
This time,

95
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,279
heaven finally gave clear instructions

96
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,879
with a Yin-Yang sign.

97
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,319
I could finally breathe easier.

98
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
I intended to avert national calamity.

99
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:30,360
Yet unexpectedly,

100
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,120
Heaven has its design.

101
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,319
It seems the wedding

102
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,920
can only wait till the border wars cease

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,959
and then be decided.

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,759
Regent,

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,560
we must prioritize the greater good.

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,839
Since Heaven decrees it so,

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
I raise no objection.

108
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
Regarding the borders,

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,480
I believe the prolonged stalemate

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,480
stems from lacking capable personnel.

111
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,839
Though Marquis Jingyuan achieved merits,

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
he's advanced in years

113
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,160
without competent strategists.

114
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,759
I recommend someone

115
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,480
whose strategies
rival legendary advisors'.

116
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,040
If he assists Marquis Jingyuan,

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
the border wars will surely end swiftly,

118
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
resolving our crisis
and Your Majesty's worries.

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,759
Whom do you recommend?

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,120
Tell me promptly.

121
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,360
The very person is

122
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,680
Your Majesty
and the First Prince's tutor,

123
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,199
Cheng Ziru.

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,860
Regent,

125
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:48,800
are you trying to send him to his death?

126
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
Your Majesty is mistaken.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,759
In peril, duty calls every man.

128
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,720
Shouldn't a true man serve his country

129
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,720
and sovereign?

130
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,680
A true man dies for his nation.

131
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,040
Are the soldiers at the border
allowed to die,

132
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,120
but Cheng Ziru cannot die?

133
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,839
Your Majesty,

134
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
I'll go to the frontier

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,360
to assist Marquis Jingyuan.

136
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,199
Grant me this chance to prove my worth.

137
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,120
Cheng Ziru,

138
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
you're a civil official.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,800
Your Majesty, issue an edict

140
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,600
permitting me to go to the border

141
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,399
to fulfill my devotion

142
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,040
to the country and Your Majesty.

143
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:31,839
Well said.

144
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,720
You're worthy of being my tutor.

145
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,600
I shall personally see you off.

146
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,928
(Yixiang Palace)

147
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,352
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,759
Yu Feng,

149
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,199
I...

150
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,120
I need to ask a favor of you.

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,279
As Ziru journeys to the border,

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,080
I want you to protect him in secret.

153
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,279
I refuse.

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
Fine.

155
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,679
But

156
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
if you want me to go,

157
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
I'll go.

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,679
I never imagined

159
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,159
you'd go this far for Cheng Ziru.

160
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,279
Yes.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,919
I love him.

162
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,600
- Then I...
- Yu Feng.

163
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,960
Whether in the past, present,

164
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,039
or future,

165
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
you've always held

166
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,559
a familial place in my heart.

167
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,000
Therefore,

168
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,000
if you're unwilling,

169
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,919
I won't force you.

170
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,559
I'll go.

171
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,759
Protect yourself and the First Prince.

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,440
Didn't His Majesty say

173
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,559
he'd see you off?

174
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,840
I didn't let him come.

175
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,639
By the way,

176
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,840
you asked Yu Feng to protect me.

177
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,600
What about your safety?

178
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't I have the Regent...

179
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,840
No.

180
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,960
The Emperor Emeritus can protect me.

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,879
This journey is long.

182
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,440
With Yu Feng by your side, I'm at ease.

183
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,639
Then...

184
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,120
What if...

185
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,799
What if I don't return?

186
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,480
Don't speak nonsense.

187
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
Stop that talk.

188
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
The border's miasma-filled lands

189
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,399
are damp and sweltering.

190
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,120
You must protect yourself.

191
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,159
You must understand

192
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,960
