=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,218
(Half a day earlier)

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,920
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,359
The Empress Dowager deceived me.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,616
This matter

25
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:32,959
reached your ears so soon?

26
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:34,200
It appears

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
the one behind it
orchestrated this deliberately.

28
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,519
To let me know
about the prince's lineage.

29
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,400
What's wrong with it?

30
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,760
The truth of his lineage is important.

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,359
But if his true aim

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,959
is to make you have no heir?

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,920
You harbor doubts

34
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,439
about Noble Lady Zhu
being the prince's mother,

35
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,120
but once officially acknowledged,

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
no one may question it.

37
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,879
Now, they challenge
the prince's lineage.

38
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,840
In the future,

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,000
they'll challenge your lineage.

40
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,000
That is the true danger.

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,919
Found the rumor's origin?

42
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:11,800
Your Majesty,

43
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:14,599
it originated
from Noble Lady Zhu's palace.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,199
They planted agents

45
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,199
in her chambers!

46
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,759
How thorough of my uncle.

47
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:20,960
The solution is simple.

48
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,800
Explain.

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
Rather than let others verify it,

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,319
we should strike first.

51
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,159
You should personally verify it.

52
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,800
If Noble Lady Zhu remains a virgin,

53
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,800
it proves treasonous deception.

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
Concealing the prince's true parentage

55
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,759
would then become impossible.

56
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,520
But favoring her...

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,159
Since they crave a spectacle,

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,599
we'll give them a performance.

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,360
An excellent strategy.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,240
(Xuanming Palace)

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,319
The Office of Imperial Affairs
awaits your selection.

62
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,199
Noble Lady Zhu serves me well.

63
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,639
She entered my harem,

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,919
but I've yet to visit her.

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,199
Perhaps

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,560
I shall visit Noble Lady Zhu tonight.

67
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,919
Your Majesty.

68
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,560
The wine is finished.

69
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Let me help you change.

70
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:41,825
=Episode 7=

71
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,759
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,080
After examination,

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,439
I can tell Noble Lady Zhu
isn't currently menstruating.

74
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,719
She has never borne children

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,240
and remains a virgin.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,719
Noble Lady Zhu is the prince's mother.

77
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,919
How could she retain her virginity?

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,439
If others ask this,

79
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,240
how will you respond?

80
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,240
We'll respond exactly

81
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,520
as you instruct, Your Majesty.

82
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,399
We follow
your command, Your Majesty.

83
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,040
Your Ladyship,

84
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,720
you impersonated the prince's mother

85
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,160
and deceived the Emperor.

86
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,480
You've committed
multiple capital offenses.

87
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,079
It's...

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,439
The Empress Dowager
ordered me to pose as his mother.

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,680
I fully confess my crime.

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,920
I beg Your Majesty's mercy.

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,959
Her Majesty arranged this deception.

92
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,439
So you know

93
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,800
the child's mother, right?

94
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
Her Majesty

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
never told me about that.

96
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
I truly have no knowledge.

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,839
Someone!

98
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,480
Take her out and execute her.

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,240
Yes.

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,879
Alright!

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,199
I'll tell you!

102
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:55,959
Your Majesty!

103
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
I'll confess!

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,120
I'll confess!

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,839
I knew you wouldn't be asleep

106
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
on such a beautiful night.

107
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,920
What brings you here at this hour?

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
Our last moon-viewing was cut short.

109
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,879
Tonight's moon shines brilliantly.

110
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,279
I invite you to share
this spectacle with me

111
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
lest we waste such perfect beauty.

112
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,920
Regent,

113
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,519
moonlight doesn't reach
shadowed corners.

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,519
I heard interesting news

115
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,879
today.

116
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,240
Rumor has it that the prince
is of unknown origin.

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,079
Tell me.

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,519
Whose bloodline
does this child truly carry?

119
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,040
The prince was born
by the Empress Dowager?

120
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,680
This is grave. Are you certain?

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,120
I've earned execution.

122
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,279
How dare I lie further to Your Majesty?

123
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,639
Master.

124
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,399
The Empress Dowager.

125
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,079
Impossible.

126
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,199
I misspoke.

127
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,879
But Your Majesty,

128
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
given Her Majesty's impeccable manners,

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
this must be malicious slander
from schemers.

130
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,959
What's your opinion?

131
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,000
This is of grave importance.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
We must investigate thoroughly.

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,639
Fuji.

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,319
We're going to Yixiang Palace.

135
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,600
Watch Noble Lady Zhu.

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,959
No one shall enter

137
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,240
without my permission.

138
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,240
Yes.

139
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,480
As you said, these are just rumors.

140
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
The prince is undoubtedly
His Majesty's flesh and blood.

141
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,759
Since when

142
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,920
can a virgin bear children?

143
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,600
A v-v-virgin?

144
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,639
W-W-What does this mean?

145
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,816
Don't you know his Majesty knows

146
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:08,519
that Noble Lady Zhu remains chaste?

147
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,000
This baby was discovered in your palace.

148
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,560
Now, his officially recognized mother

149
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,759
is suddenly revealed to be a virgin.

150
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,120
Don't you think

151
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,560
things grow more interesting?

152
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,519
Zhao Chengtian!

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,639
What are you doing?

154
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
I shall eliminate him

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
to protect the purity
of the royal bloodline.

156
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,839
Didn't you come to watch the moon?

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
To watch the moon

158
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,759
and certain people.

159
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,519
His Majesty arrives!

160
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Why are you here at this hour?

161
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Is anything wrong?

162
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Recent rumors in the palace

163
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,600
doubt the prince's origins.

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,040
I fear such gossip spreading

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,240
would tarnish our reputation,

166
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,519
so I came to discuss with Her Majesty

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,480
and, additionally, to verify

168
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,560
whether this child
is truly yours, Your Majesty.

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,079
Uncle, you're kidding.

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
Xiao Hu is unquestionably my son.

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,959
As you noted earlier,

172
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,399
rumors proliferate.

173
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,639
Since they're rumors,

174
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,960
why care about them?

175
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,639
For our family's reputation,

176
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,399
could you please trace

177
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,240
the source of these falsehoods?

178
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,120
That such slander spreads
unchecked through the palace

179
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,519
reveals treacherous scheming
behind the scenes.

180
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,039
Since you handle
state affairs for His Majesty,

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,919
you should swiftly
investigate these rumors

182
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,879
to restore order to the court.

183
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,039
Precisely.

184
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,200
Such defamatory talk

185
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,399
brings shame to the imperial family.

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,159
No smoke without fire.

187
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,360
Your firstborn son's arrival

188
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,919
should be celebrated nationwide.

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,799
But months have passed

190
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
with only a harem decree recognizing

191
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Noble Lady Zhu.

192
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
No official announcement
has been made in public.

193
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,679
This irregular conduct

194
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
naturally breeds public suspicion.

195
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Unless the child's origins
are indeed dubious.

196
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,639
I must act prudently.

197
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,240
We intended to wait for a good date

198
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,480
before making the announcement.

199
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,360
Why such impatience, Uncle?

200
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,440
An official proclamation

201
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,120
would silence the gossips

202
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,320
and dispel these rumors.

203
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,399
If there's nothing else,

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,320
we shouldn't disturb her rest further.

205
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,960
My apologies for disturbing

206
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,559
you this late.

207
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
At tomorrow's court session,

208
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,519
I request your presence in governance.

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
I'll take my leave.

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
Thank you

211
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,960
for your care for the prince.

212
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,879
Please go to bed early tonight.

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,279
I'll take my leave.

214
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
What do I do?

215
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,320
Zhao Chengtian...

216
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,919
Do you remain anxious
about the prince's situation?

217
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,440
Right now,

218
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,080
just turn their scheme against them.

219
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,279
My uncle already has

220
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,279
suspicions about the prince matter.

221
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,200
If he obtains concrete evidence,

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,960
he'll surely challenge
the prince's lineage

223
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,080
during court proceedings.

224
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,399
Whether Noble Lady Zhu is a virgin

225
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,840
is not up to His Grace.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
With a physician's testimony,

227
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,799
deceiving the throne

228
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,960
could be dismissed
as a simple misunderstanding.

229
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,919
Then

230
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,720
the prince could exist openly.

231
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,200
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

232
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,879
Physician Zhou, Matron Wang.

233
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,879
Last night, I ordered you two

234
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,279
to verify Noble Lady Zhu's virtue.

235
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,759
Report the findings

236
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,360
to the Regent truthfully.

237
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,679
Your Grace,

238
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,240
through my examination,

239
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,399
Noble Lady Zhu showed
maiden's blood last night

240
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,440
and showed no signs of childbirth.

241
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Nonsense!

242
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,159
Matron Wang, you tell him.

243
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,840
I examined her alongside Physician Zhou

244
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,399
and concur

245
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,759
with his conclusion.
