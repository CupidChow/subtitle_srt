=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,696
Though Xiao Hu isn't the Regent's,

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,936
he's not yours either.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,959
You... you...

24
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,344
There's another man?

25
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:26,464
You...

26
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,959
(Let's see how you'll react.)

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,959
I've decided.

28
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,976
No matter who you have

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,704
or who Xiao Hu's father is,

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,280
I will

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,959
treat him as my own.

32
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,144
I know.

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,159
But this time,

34
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,920
you truly can't treat him as your own.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,672
Because he is His Majesty's son.

36
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,688
Swallow that thought right now.

37
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,952
I'm not his mother.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,256
You are not?

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
Of course not.

40
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,840
You are not. Cuizhu is not.

41
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,840
Then who is?

42
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,120
Is there someone else?

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,599
My maid Rong gave birth to him.

44
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:51,136
=Episode 18=

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,216
Where is the palace?

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Why are we at my home?

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,896
I go wherever I wish.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,650
So this is

49
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:18,208
what it feels like to live

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,000
an ordinary life with you.

51
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,400
I won't let you marry Zhao Chengtian.

52
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,319
I want him dead.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
What do you mean?

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,728
Xiao Hu is in his grasp now.

55
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:43,264
We've endured him enough.

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,599
It's time to end this.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,879
How do we end it?

58
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,639
Lure him into rebellion,

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
bringing his own doom.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,240
But won't

61
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,360
the plan's risk be too great?

62
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,320
Can't we just eliminate him

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,599
physically?

64
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,639
He'd be seen as a victim.

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,439
His crimes

66
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,840
couldn't be exposed to the world.

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,479
Even His Majesty

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,160
would bear the charge
of murdering his uncle.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
It's too merciful for him.

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,808
I understand.

71
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,399
He can't die easily.

72
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,959
He must be condemned for eternity.

73
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,040
But

74
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,079
I don't want you risking yourself.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
You nearly died for me.

76
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:39,399
A little risk is nothing.

77
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,480
Tell me.

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,279
What do you need me to do?

79
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,040
To stage a performance.

80
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,488
As long as I can be with you

81
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,240
and Xiao Hu grows up healthy,

82
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll do anything.

83
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,016
(Xuanming Palace)

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,639
Your Majesty.

85
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,688
Calm your anger.

86
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,360
What more is there to say?

87
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,399
You've been utterly bewitched by her.

88
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,360
You're on her side now.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,199
An Empress Dowager remarrying?

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,560
A huge laughingstock.

91
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,319
How dare you speak of it?

92
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,000
Not just remarrying.

93
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
You'd honor him as Emperor Emeritus?

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Your family of three

95
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
is taking my entire empire.

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,480
For causing Your Majesty anguish,

97
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,240
I deserve death ten thousand times.

98
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,560
Your Majesty, calm yourself.

99
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,496
Hear me out.

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,759
What's left to say?

101
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,639
Xiao Hu is not the Regent's child.

102
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,519
You went to the Regent's Manor
for a blood test,

103
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,800
and now you lie to me?

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,664
Do you think I'd believe...

105
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:03,360
The blood paternity test was faked.

106
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,199
Your Majesty,

107
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,680
I can prove

108
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
the blood test was Her Majesty's ploy

109
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,040
to free me.

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,600
Master,

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,120
how can you still trust her?

112
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,360
This woman even faked a blood test.

113
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,839
What else can be real?

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,744
This

115
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
is ironclad proof
that Xiao Hu is Your Majesty's son.

116
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,384
Does Your Majesty recall

117
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,120
being drunk two years ago

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,184
and storming my palace at night?

119
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,839
Empress Dowager.

120
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,240
How could you...

121
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,048
How could you do such a thing?

122
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,952
You actually... with my uncle?

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,000
How am I supposed to face the world now?

124
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,959
Escort His Majesty
to the side hall to rest.

125
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:01,040
Take good care of him.

126
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,639
Your Majesty.

128
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,720
Your Majesty.

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,199
What?

130
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,839
Xiao Hu is my son?

131
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,360
Since you took the throne,

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,879
the Regent has monopolized power.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Many children in the palace
died by his hands.

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
We kept it secret from you

135
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,839
to deceive the Regent as well

136
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,440
and preserve

137
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:35,519
a bloodline for you.

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,984
So I agreed to marry the Regent

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,224
to buy us crucial time

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,208
to ultimately overthrow him.

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,639
But why should I believe you?

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,399
By now,

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,584
do you still believe

144
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,432
I murdered your mother?

145
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:55,744
Isn't it true?

146
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:56,800
No.

147
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,000
Mr. Cheng,

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
following your clues,

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,560
we found the late Empress's
personal maid.

150
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,040
She gave me her mistress's letter
to Her Majesty.

151
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,920
The late Empress
was watched by the Regent.

152
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,519
She secretly told her maid

153
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,879
to deliver this letter.

154
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,920
Give this letter

155
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,920
to Rong before you leave.

156
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,399
Tell her

157
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,360
His Majesty

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,864
(Late Empress)

159
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:34,112
is entrusted to her care now.

160
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Yes.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
(After she passed,)

162
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,432
(the Regent spread rumors
of their discord.)

163
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,480
- (The maid wouldn't lie)
- Pleas stop.

164
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:49,568
(or dare fight.)

165
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,000
Rong, listen to me.

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,159
(Eventually, she fled
to her hometown with the letter.)

167
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,328
Due to the Regent,

168
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,952
Her Majesty couldn't see
the late Empress

169
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,039
and has regretted it.

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,799
After the late Emperor died,

171
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,679
to placate the Regent

172
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,200
and keep the throne,

173
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,879
(Her Majesty yielded to him.)

174
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
(Later, she tarnished
her own name to protect)

175
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,320
(your heir)

176
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,480
(and forbade us from telling anyone.)

177
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,440
Today I defy Her Majesty's decree

178
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,399
because I can't

179
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,879
bear watching her
suffer slander and betrayal.

180
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,799
I await punishment.

181
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,696
How could I be so blind?

182
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,720
I've let you endure such injustice.

183
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,480
I beg forgiveness.

184
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,200
Empress Dowager...

185
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,039
Mother,

186
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,000
punish your unworthy son.

187
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,679
Let the past

188
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,159
be forgotten.

189
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,000
Since

190
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,759
I promised the late Empress,

191
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,992
I shall

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,336
defend

193
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,759
Your Majesty's throne.

194
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,120
Instead of skimming the surface,

195
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:28,576
we'll strike at the root.

196
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,600
Her Majesty and I have devised a plan,

197
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,960
seeking Your Majesty's aid.

198
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,640
I will help.

199
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,759
You fool.

200
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,960
The late Empress's maid...

201
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,320
I've been protecting her in secret.

202
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,120
With her limited skills,

203
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,120
how could she evade
the Regent's assassins?

204
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,559
So you mean

205
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,240
you've had proof
of my innocence all along?

206
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,399
Why didn't you reveal it earlier?

207
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,960
Forgive me.

208
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,279
I lacked the power
to confront the Regent then.

209
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,696
Only by making him believe

210
00:11:13,888 --> 00:11:14,919
his lies were accepted

211
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,039
and the world convinced

212
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
could I truly protect you

213
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,480
and His Majesty.

214
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,080
By Heaven's mandate,

215
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,320
the Emperor decrees.

216
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,639
To dispel celestial omens

217
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,039
and pray for national prosperity,

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,736
I hereby approve

219
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,808
Empress Dowager Zhaohui's marriage
to the Regent

220
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
as an auspicious union

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,279
to bless the realm.

222
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
The Regent shall be honored
as Emperor Emeritus.

223
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,360
The wedding and enthronement date

224
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,960
shall be divined by His Majesty

225
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,912
to seek Heaven's will,

226
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,639
demonstrating
the devout prayers for the nation.

227
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,720
So it is decreed.

228
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,440
I obey the decree.

229
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,279
Congratulations, Your Grace.

230
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,159
Congratulations.

231
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,080
No.

232
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,720
I misspoke.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,056
Congratulations,
Your Majesty, the Emperor Emeritus.
