=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,392
That day,

22
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,760
when Mr. Cheng entered
the southwest border region,

23
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,519
he and his horse were ambushed
by a group of bandits.

24
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,040
How did you know this?

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,599
During Mr. Cheng's abduction,

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,920
a guard went to relieve himself.

27
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:21,920
Upon returning,

28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,079
he witnessed the bandits
taking Mr. Cheng away.

29
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,719
That guard reported
to Marquis Jingyuan at once.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,959
The Marquis
dispatched troops for rescue.

31
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,239
But those bandits

32
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,519
set fire to the mountain.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,359
What?

34
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,680
By the time we arrived,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,544
the stronghold holding Mr. Cheng

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,400
had been reduced to ashes.

37
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,496
Audacious criminals.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,319
I'll wipe out their clans.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
Calm your rage, Your Majesty.

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,584
This is nonsense.

41
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,336
I beg forgiveness.

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,519
I failed my duty

43
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,704
of protecting Mr. Cheng.

44
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,616
What's going on?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,752
I secretly sent Yu Feng to protect Ziru.

46
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,240
Yu Feng,

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,199
tell us.

48
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,360
What exactly happened?

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,768
Mr. Cheng was indeed
captured by bandits.

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
They outnumbered us.

51
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,552
Without a sure win,

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,360
I avoided reckless action.

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
So I sought Marquis Jingyuan's aid.

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,360
The Marquis sent Captain Fang with me

55
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,240
for the rescue.

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,992
But upon arrival,

57
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:28,000
we were merely
to confirm Mr. Cheng's death.

58
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,176
What?

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,384
Captain Fang said

60
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:33,800
the entire thing

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,872
was orchestrated
by the Regent and the Marquis,

62
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:37,664
and we were to follow orders.

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
I attempted rescue alone,

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,560
only to find

65
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,200
Mr. Cheng's body reduced to ashes.

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,919
Silence.

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,944
Impudent wretch.

68
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,319
How dare you slander me
before the court?

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,240
Guards.

70
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,120
Arrest this deceiver of the throne.

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,640
Stop.

72
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,240
Why the haste to apprehend him?

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
To eliminate a witness perhaps?

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,000
This man spews lies

75
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,144
and slanders me before His Majesty.

76
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
He has brazen insolence.

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,168
Whether it's slander

78
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,120
needs further investigation.

79
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,392
Yu Feng accuses you
and the Marquis of colluding.

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,869
For now,

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,496
you should step back.

82
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,056
Alright.

83
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll observe what evidence emerges.

84
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:22,912
Yu Feng.

85
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:23,968
Yu Feng.

86
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:25,360
Yu Feng.

87
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,360
Yu Feng,

88
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,640
tell me.

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,039
Is Ziru truly dead?

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,400
Your Majesty.

91
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,639
Tell me.

92
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,919
Did you witness it personally?

93
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,512
Did you witness it personally?

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,719
This man has opposed me repeatedly.

95
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,680
This could be malicious framing.

96
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,352
I demand his imprisonment

97
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,120
and thorough interrogations.

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,879
Uncle,

99
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,608
this matter is important,

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,112
needing full investigation.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,224
Yu Feng is a key witness.

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,816
Holding him before the truth emerges

103
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:11,744
violates protocols.

104
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,304
Let Imperial Guards
detain him temporarily

105
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,792
until facts come to light.

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,672
Does this satisfy you?

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,704
So be it by imperial decree.

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,328
Your Majesty must personally oversee it

109
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
to swiftly clear my name.

110
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:44,256
=Episode 20=

111
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,279
Your Majesty, please have some soup.

112
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,560
You've eaten nothing all day.

113
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,920
This will ruin your health.

114
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,944
His Majesty arrives.

115
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,120
Mother,

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
what are you doing?

117
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,024
Since returning from court,

118
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,560
she hasn't eaten, drunk, or spoken.

119
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,680
Your Majesty, please console her.

120
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:17,959
Mother,

121
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,920
I share your grief.

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,079
But you must preserve your health.

123
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,319
I won't

124
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,879
let this matter rest.

125
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,319
We must find her alive or dead.

126
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,959
Without finding Master's body now,

127
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,360
perhaps...

128
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,319
Perhaps he is still alive.

129
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Yu Feng would never lie to me.

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,319
Even if it's true,

131
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,040
you must stay strong.

132
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,264
Otherwise, Master's soul

133
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,279
won't rest in peace.

134
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,319
Now that Master's gone,

135
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,560
if anything happens to you,

136
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,720
I won't remain emperor.

137
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,232
He An.

138
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,736
He An,

139
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,199
there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

140
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,792
You're the emperor,

141
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,079
the rightful ruler of this nation.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,279
You follow heaven's will above

143
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
and the people's will below.

144
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,168
None of us can walk with you forever.

145
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,480
One day,

146
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,160
you'll have to rely on yourself

147
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,680
to uphold this nation.

148
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,824
Do you understand?

149
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,056
I'll remember

150
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,488
what you said.

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,416
Then I ask you

152
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,176
to preserve your health

153
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,512
for the nation.

154
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,472
I'll take my leave.

155
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,304
Okay.

156
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,800
Your Majesty.

157
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,832
(Regent's Manor)

158
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,856
Seeing your distracted state in court,

159
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,480
I thought you'd mourn
that male consort for days.

160
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Yet you invited me for moonlit drinks.

161
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,336
Had a change of heart?

162
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
You jest.

163
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,560
Our marriage is decreed.

164
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,960
I'll be yours eventually.

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
Now,

166
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,640
after recognizing the situation,

167
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,079
I'm simply following the current.

168
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,384
To you.

169
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,392
Good.

170
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,664
'Following the current' indeed.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,319
Your power eclipses all,

172
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,439
second only to the throne.

173
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,920
Besides,

174
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,300
haven't I

175
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,800
long been your person?

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,279
Had you been so sensible earlier,

177
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,480
I wouldn't have labored so hard,

178
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,328
and that male consort
might've been alive.

179
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,799
Now I've realized it.

180
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,808
It's not too late.

181
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,960
So you enjoy dangerous games?

182
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,400
Quite perilous,

183
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,400
but I enjoy them too.

184
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,296
I knew your kindness was fake.

185
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,496
You'd assassinate me
for that male consort?

186
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,920
Such touching devotion.

187
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,616
You monster.

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,879
You killed Ziru.

189
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
If I can't kill you today,

190
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,720
I'll join him in death.

191
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,039
Rest assured.

192
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,248
I swear

193
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,039
you won't die with him.

194
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,679
You...

195
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,856
You will live through this.

196
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,200
I intend to grandly welcome you

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,056
as my bride.

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,650
Zhao Chengtian.

199
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:52,919
Let me out, you scoundrel.

200
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,559
Save your strength.

201
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,279
Neither marriage nor death

202
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,879
is your choice.

203
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,519
You...

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,784
Someone! Help!

205
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Zhao Chengtian.

206
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:07,072
Outrageous.

207
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,824
The Empress Dowager
attempting assassination?

208
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:11,552
Playing heroine now?

209
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,152
Where's she now?

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,279
Your Majesty,

211
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,519
Her Majesty is confined

212
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,159
in the Regent's Manor's rear chamber.

213
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,752
Though guarded,

214
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,288
maids attend to her needs.

215
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,960
She's not mistreated.

216
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
If she comes to harm,

217
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll truly be alone.

218
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,480
Fuji,

219
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,928
to the Regent's Manor.

220
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,336
Yes.

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,399
Zhao Chengtian.

222
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,399
Her Majesty has killed herself!

223
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,639
No!

224
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,080
Someone, come quick!

225
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,679
Her Majesty has killed herself!

226
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,480
Want to die?

227
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,600
You won't die without my permission.

228
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,759
I have endless patience

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,879
for you to reconsider.

230
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,039
You'll yield eventually.

231
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,648
Despite all calculations,

232
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,408
I didn't expect

233
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,816
that I couldn't stand blood.

234
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
It hurts.

235
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,399
Blood.

236
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,879
I had the Board of Astronomy

237
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,679
calculate an auspicious wedding date.

238
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,816
Uncle, what do you think?

239
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,080
Without waiting for war's end?

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
After careful deliberation,

241
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,480
I think it's good

242
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,159
and shows my filial piety.

243
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:21,632
Thank you, nephew.

244
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,639
I'll accept this gesture
on the Empress Dowager's behalf.

245
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,000
Since you approve the date,

246
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,279
I'll take the Empress Dowager
to the palace.

247
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,136
She's been betrothed to me.

248
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,792
Residing here is proper.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,152
She should abandon
this Empress Dowager charade.

250
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,400
She embodies the nation.

251
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,800
Imperial weddings need solemnity.

252
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,688
Besides, I heard she tried suicide.

253
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,032
Aren't you worried she...

254
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,216
Should anything happen to her,

255
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:52,160
how would you become
the Emperor Emeritus?

256
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,680
The Emperor Emeritus?

257
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:01,984
He An,

258
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,648
do you think I still

259
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:05,920
care about such an empty title?

260
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:07,968
Cheng Ziru is dead.

261
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:09,824
If she dies too,

262
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,639
who will support you?

263
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,799
I warned you before.

264
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,832
I raised you to power

265
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,200
and can remove you just as easily.

266
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,679
But you should know

267
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,000
usurpers remain usurpers in history.

268
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,192
Don't you care

269
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,280
how history will judge you?

270
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,592
Hasn't Your Majesty heard

271
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,480
history belongs to the victors?

272
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,824
Records can be altered.

273
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,064
But you can't silence

274
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,472
the people's voices forever.

275
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,576
If history's written by winners,

276
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,200
how do we all know

277
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,808
that the former dynasty's

278
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:49,152
Emperor Zhixin got deposed

279
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,560
by his uncle?

280
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
If you scorn posthumous judgment,

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,656
I've nothing more to say.

282
00:14:00,544 --> 00:14:01,984
You want the nation, don't you?

283
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,416
Release the Empress Dowager,

284
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,976
and I'll proclaim
the First Prince as Crown Prince.
