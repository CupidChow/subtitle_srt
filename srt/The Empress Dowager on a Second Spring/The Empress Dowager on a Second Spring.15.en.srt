=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,480
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:20,400
One-year-old catch.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Let's just conduct

24
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,599
this ritual privately within our palace.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,599
Traditionally, yes.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
But I heard

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,250
the Regent personally told His Majesty

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,280
to hold a grand ceremony.

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,439
He says Xiao Hu
is His Majesty's firstborn,

30
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,079
(The One-Year-Old Catch Ceremony)
so it should be

31
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,159
a big celebration
involving the court and the harem.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,560
If that's the case,

33
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,879
this matter seems suspicious.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,239
He must be plotting something again.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,519
Since the decision's been made,

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,920
we must stay vigilant

37
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,424
during the ceremony.

38
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,959
Don't worry.

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Even if it costs my life,

40
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll guard Your Majesty
and the First Prince.

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,144
=Episode 15=

42
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,688
(Xuanming Palace)

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,520
The auspicious hour has come.

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,280
The one-year-old catch ceremony begins!

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,719
You may observe the rites at leisure.

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
First Prince.

47
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,120
Come, Your Highness.

48
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,560
The prince crying

49
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,159
during this ceremony

50
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,680
bodes ill.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,039
Lord Jiang,

52
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,400
I require your diplomatic maneuvering

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,439
during the ceremony.

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,080
Subtly stir dissent.

55
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,000
Ensure it shocks all witnesses.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,319
(I knew Zhao Chengtian would scheme.)

57
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,199
Nurse Liu.

58
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,560
The prince must be weary.

59
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,080
Take him to rest.

60
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,159
Yu Feng.

61
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,439
Guard the First Prince.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,360
This inauspicious sign

63
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,960
requires Lord Qi's analysis.

64
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,919
Where's Lord Qi?

65
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,120
I am here.

66
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,400
Mr. Qi,

67
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,400
you're our celestial expert.

68
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,960
Watch the sky

69
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,719
carefully,

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,319
and then interpret
unusual celestial patterns

71
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,199
as dire portents.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Your Grace.

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,879
Just now,

74
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,560
a solar halo suddenly appeared.

75
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,199
An ill omen.

76
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
The prince's tears
during the one-year-old catch ceremony

77
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,919
signify weak leadership
and a failing state.

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,680
With border conflicts intensifying,

79
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,919
we risk military collapse.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,159
Dire omens.

81
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,280
Everyone,

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,840
a solar halo merely foretells rain.

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,439
Thunder precedes rainfall.

84
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,120
If these ill omens hold,

85
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,800
can we counteract them?

86
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,839
Your Grace,

87
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,199
a nationally celebrated auspicious event

88
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,720
could neutralize this curse.

89
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,399
An auspicious event?

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,399
What qualifies?

91
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,560
Your Majesty,

92
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,959
advancing His Majesty's wedding

93
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,399
would suffice.

94
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,824
But His Majesty decreed

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,560
to wed after securing the borders.

96
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,439
Reversing this pledge

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,560
would damage imperial credibility.

98
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,936
If border defenses collapse

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,879
due to this change,

100
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,720
who'll bear

101
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,680
the responsibility?

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,360
If the imperial word

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,639
is retracted,

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
it'll bode ill.

105
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,519
Everyone,

106
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
what other auspicious events

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,720
could avert this disaster?

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,720
Not necessarily the Emperor's wedding.

109
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,879
If someone

110
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,600
of equal royal status weds,

111
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,040
it might suffice.

112
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,800
The Emperor is a true dragon.

113
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,839
The one of comparable stature

114
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,319
must be

115
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,800
a phoenix,

116
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,560
namely,

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,959
the Empress Dowager.

118
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,560
Preposterous!

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,839
You would even suggest

120
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,199
Her Majesty remarry?

121
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,240
This is ridiculous.

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Your Majesty,

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,959
if the Empress Dowager weds

124
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,920
to safeguard our nation,

125
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,079
this not only eases your burden

126
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,879
but also benefits the entire world.

127
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,360
You...

128
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,399
Resolving national crises
cannot be delayed.

129
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,360
But the Empress Dowager's remarriage

130
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,839
must not be hastily arranged.

131
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,279
As for the candidate,

132
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,199
I notice someone present

133
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,639
would be perfectly suitable.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,519
The only match for Her Majesty

135
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,120
is our Regent.

136
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,360
As everyone knows,

137
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,439
the Regent's consort passed years ago,

138
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,639
leaving her position vacant.

139
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,279
Their ages align perfectly,

140
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:17,040
making them a perfect pair.

141
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,720
Well...

142
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,600
If it serves the nation,

143
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,639
I would naturally oblige.

144
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:28,360
Absolutely not!

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,319
Her Majesty descending
to become a consort?

146
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,160
This violates all propriety.

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,199
Demoting the Empress Dowager

148
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,519
is improper.

149
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,560
But what if the Regent
becomes the Emperor Emeritus?

150
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,720
What did you say?

151
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,399
Our dynasty rules through filial piety.

152
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,319
The Regent guides His Majesty's reign

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
as a father to his son.

154
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,079
Enthroning him as the Emperor Emeritus

155
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:54,160
would create

156
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,680
a matching status
to pair with Her Majesty.

157
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:58,600
That's absurd!

158
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:00,720
Forcing Her Majesty to remarry

159
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,360
and creating a new Emperor Emeritus?

160
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:06,279
Do you even respect the Emperor?

161
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:07,959
Are you plotting rebellion?

162
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,759
We discuss Her Majesty's remarriage

163
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,319
to avert calamity and share

164
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,720
His Majesty's burden.

165
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:17,279
You useless man!

166
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,240
How dare you lecture here?

167
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,448
Fabricated charges

168
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:22,279
need no justification.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,279
If Her Majesty weds me,

170
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:29,199
it'll bless our nation and people.

171
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,720
Your Majesty, please
consider the greater good.

172
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,632
You can't escape this.

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
How about just yielding to me?

174
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:42,592
I'll keep this weakling alive.

175
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,136
You...

176
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,160
Zhao Chengtian, I'll kill you!

177
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
Rong.

178
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,040
Rong!

179
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,079
Rong.

180
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:18,720
(Yixiang Palace)

181
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,199
Your Majesty, are you okay?

182
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,199
Where's Ziru? Where did he go?

183
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:27,639
Mr. Cheng

184
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,199
was taken to the Regent's dungeon.

185
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,519
The Regent's dungeon?

186
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,679
Why was he captured?

187
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,960
The Regent accuses him
of attempted regicide

188
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
and rebellion.

189
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:40,960
He will interrogate him,

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,519
and then send him to Justice.

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,720
He wants Ziru dead.

192
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,039
Don't worry.

193
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,519
I'll gather more intelligence.

194
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,080
What exactly happened?

195
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:56,720
You were hit and fell unconscious,

196
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,360
causing complete chaos.

197
00:08:58,816 --> 00:08:59,919
Traitor!

198
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,320
Assassinating His Majesty!

199
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:01,919
Guards!

200
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:02,879
Seize him!

201
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:03,720
- Yes!
- Yes!

202
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:06,919
Captain Yu knocked Mr. Cheng unconscious

203
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:08,360
and saved Your Majesty.

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,639
Mr. Cheng is captured.

205
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,639
Lower your weapon!

206
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:16,200
Fortunately, Captain Yu acted swiftly.

207
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,399
Otherwise, Mr. Cheng

208
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:19,712
would've been executed
by the Imperial Guards.

209
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,720
Assassinating His Majesty.

210
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:27,759
The Regent's scheme is truly sinister.

211
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,600
Chain him!

212
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
How is Her Majesty?

213
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,240
Worry about yourself

214
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
and whether you'll see tomorrow's dawn.

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,399
Go!

216
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:51,960
Where's Her Majesty?

217
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,279
Your Grace, Her Majesty rests.

218
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:58,840
Biyu.

219
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:07,679
How is your injury?

220
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,279
I bear no grudge for your strike,

221
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,776
but I beg you to release Ziru.

222
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,240
What spell

223
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,759
has that paramour cast upon you?

224
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,360
He's a condemned regicide conspirator.

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
You want his pardon?

226
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,919
Unless you consent to marry me.

227
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,159
I need time to consider this.

228
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,519
But now,

229
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,919
I'm tired.

230
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,759
Once I make my decision,

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,279
I will naturally inform you.

232
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,399
Do not keep me waiting long.

233
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,432
The prisoner

234
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,600
in the death cell
can't endure that long.

235
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,799
Your Majesty,

236
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,919
are you truly going to marry the Regent?

237
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,799
As you've witnessed,

238
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,279
the Regent is relentless.

239
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,279
He won't be deterred.

240
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
If he desires it,

241
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:28,519
he can conjure 100 pretexts
to force this marriage.

242
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,720
Now, he threatens me with Ziru's life.

243
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,960
