=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,920
Did I wake you?

22
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:58,976
I was awake.

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,159
So

24
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,488
do you still regret it?

25
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,144
What would I regret?

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,888
So it means

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,832
that you've known from the very start

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,872
that Xiao Hu might be...

29
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,136
That's why you risked your life
to save him.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,912
I saved Xiao Hu

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
because he's your child.

32
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,528
Then...

33
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,639
Then...

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,944
But he could also be

35
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:40,896
the child of...

36
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,520
I don't care.

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,472
Whether Xiao Hu is Zhao Chengtian's son,

38
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,680
he remains my student.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,639
Protecting my student

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,784
is only natural.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,576
Rong, remember.

42
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,720
No matter whose child Xiao Hu is,

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,704
I'll keep both of you safe.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
For the grievances you've suffered,

45
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,488
I'll make sure justice is served.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,599
If one day,

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,112
His Majesty wants to kill me
to avenge his mother...

48
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,840
That won't happen.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,919
I'll clear up

50
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,704
all misunderstandings for you.

51
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,784
=Episode 14=

52
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,120
Tell me,

53
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,879
what happened last night?

54
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,960
You always stage this drama

55
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,456
of storming into my palace.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,599
Do you treat my palace

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
as your manor's private garden?

58
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,160
Good.

59
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,680
You still understand
your position clearly.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,240
Now explain last night.

61
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,120
Last night?

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,160
What's wrong?

63
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,920
After the family banquet,

64
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,600
someone saw Cheng Ziru
enter your chambers.

65
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,720
He stayed all night.

66
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,120
Explain it.

67
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,352
You seem exceptionally informed

68
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,079
about palace affairs.

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,199
Since you don't deny it,

70
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,519
you admit it.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,040
Yes.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
He was here last night.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,319
And he

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,199
didn't leave until dawn.

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,879
As the Empress Dowager, you had
a man overnight in your chambers?

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Why did you do that?

77
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,240
The First Prince fell ill last night.

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,439
You know this.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,439
He cried incessantly all night.

80
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,848
Neither I nor Nurse Liu could calm him.

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,720
Thanks to Master Ziru
tending to him all night.

82
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
He stayed awake till dawn,

83
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,399
only to be falsely accused.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,800
If you doubt this,

85
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,319
summon Nurse Liu for questioning.

86
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,079
Your wet nurse

87
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,560
would naturally speak in your favor.

88
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,879
In that case,

89
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,240
there's nothing more I can say.

90
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,279
When you two were leaning

91
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,839
against the window,
snuggling and drinking under the moon,

92
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,839
did you care for the First Prince?

93
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,199
You spied on me?

94
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,040
You basically told the whole world.

95
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,959
Did I need to spy on you?

96
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,040
Desperate for men, huh?

97
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,600
What are you doing?

98
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,920
Aren't you craving men?

99
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,040
Then I'll satisfy you today.

100
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,279
Zhao Chengtian.

101
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,399
Someone.

102
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,199
Keep shouting.

103
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,920
It's my guards outside.

104
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:55,712
Even your loyal servant Yu Feng

105
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,079
has been transferred by me.

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Let's see who can save you.

107
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,800
Regent.

108
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,959
Regent.

109
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,800
Can't we talk this out?

110
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,920
Let's talk this out.

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,824
Haven't I given you time?

112
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,120
You dared visit that male consort
behind my back.

113
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,360
Male consort?

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,279
Don't speak of Ziru that way.

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,432
You've grown so intimate with him.

116
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,576
Where does that leave me?

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,439
Regent. Regent.

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,192
I want to claim you properly.

119
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,760
Our family of three

120
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,279
- will never part.
- Regent, I beg you.

121
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,170
- No other man
- Zhao Chengtian.

122
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,304
can touch you ever again.

123
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,120
I want you to marry me.

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,800
Zhao Chengtian, let me go.

125
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:37,920
Help.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Zhao Chengtian.

127
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,560
Zhao Chengtian.

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,856
Cheng Ziru,

129
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,720
how dare you
show your face before me again?

130
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,104
Not only have you repeatedly defied me,

131
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,120
but you even dared to touch my woman.

132
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:55,168
I shall end you today,

133
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,344
sparing me the irritation of seeing you.

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Uncle, what are you doing?

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,232
Both of you

136
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:08,439
missed the morning court.

137
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,000
So you've been here all along.

138
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,279
Do I not exist to you?

139
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,680
Your Majesty,

140
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
Her Majesty endured
such humiliation today.

141
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,279
I implore you

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
to deliver justice for Her Majesty.

143
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,279
Are you defending the Empress Dowager?

144
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,639
Had she maintained her virtue,

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
she wouldn't have gone through it.

146
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,519
Such classic victim-blaming rhetoric.

147
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,399
In my own chambers,

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,319
how else could I 'maintain virtue'?

149
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,208
All of you, get out.

150
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,240
Out.

151
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,640
I'll let today's matter slide for now.

152
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,848
But I always keep my word.

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,720
You won't escape.

154
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,439
I'm fine.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,199
I need to be alone.

156
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,279
Leave.

157
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,399
I'm fine.

158
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Calm your wrath.

159
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,352
I wonder when
you had switched allegiances

160
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,656
to side with the Empress Dowager
and Regent.

161
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,600
I wouldn't dare.

162
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,280
I merely can't bear

163
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,600
seeing Her Majesty being wronged.

164
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,399
Master,

165
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,088
do you distrust Fuji

166
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,240
or doubt me?

167
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,440
Did I not tell you?

168
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,928
Those two are involved.

169
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,679
In that case,

170
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,720
the resistance might be

171
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,960
their pretense of reluctance.

172
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,608
Your Majesty,

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,879
I swear

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,960
Her Majesty and the Regent
never cheated.

175
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,879
They've produced a child already.

176
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
What worth your oath?

177
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,639
No concrete evidence proves

178
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,399
the First Prince
is the Regent's son, right?

179
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,279
If not the Regent's, then whose?

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Could he be ours?

181
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,919
Mind your words.

182
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,968
I misspoke.

183
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,519
No offense.

184
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,736
Your Majesty,

185
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,720
even assuming the worst,

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,320
if the boy were truly the Regent's son,

187
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,520
you could use him as a hostage.

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,919
A hostage?

189
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,399
It would give leverage over the Regent

190
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,200
and shift initiative to our side.

191
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
And Ding Yi?

192
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,639
The Regent persists.

193
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,799
What about her?

194
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,080
Be patient.

195
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,799
Our top priority now
is to placate the Regent.

196
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,600
When border matters stabilize

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
and Marquis arrives,

198
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,879
conduct the Empress's coronation then.

199
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
This grants time

200
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,519
to investigate Lady Ding's allegiance

201
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,879
while keeping both Regent and Marquis

202
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,279
from finding fault.

203
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
I see.

204
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,000
Let it be so.

205
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,679
I'll order it.

206
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:54,799
Your Grace.

207
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,399
Your Grace.

208
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,440
(Lord Jiang, Lord Qi)

209
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,960
Gentlemen,

210
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,399
I summoned you both today

211
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,000
for crucial matters

212
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,608
requiring your counsel.

213
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,592
Success would bring you

214
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:09,039
meteoric promotions,

215
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:10,519
titles of nobility,

216
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
and boundless wealth.

217
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,960
