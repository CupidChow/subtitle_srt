=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,719
(Yixiang Palace)

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,456
I beg Your Majesty to permit me
to take the prince from the palace.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Rise now.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,159
You can't act on every sudden impulse.

25
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,000
Moreover,

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,640
it's midnight.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
Where could you possibly take him?

28
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,439
I swore an oath

29
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,000
to protect him at all costs.

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,719
It's urgent now.

31
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,239
I can't hesitate.

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,560
No.

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,319
This matter

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,480
requires careful planning.

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,000
His Majesty already knows
about this child.

36
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:39,879
If

37
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,680
His Majesty asks,

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
how will we answer him?

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,879
Besides,

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
tonight you clashed with the Regent.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,439
By tomorrow,

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,120
it will reach His Majesty's ears.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,560
Therefore,

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
you and Xiao Hu

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,200
can't leave this place.

46
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,416
=Episode 5=

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
Yesterday Captain Yu mentioned

48
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,719
that the Regent once killed children
in the palace.

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,919
What's that about?

50
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,800
It's just a rumor.

51
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,152
No one dares speak of it openly.

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,840
There's no evidence,

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,039
or witnesses, either.

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,560
Well,

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
whether it's rumor or gossip,

56
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,520
tell me everything you know.

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,120
Though His Majesty hasn't yet married,

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
he has countless concubines.

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,159
Yet after years on the throne,

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,479
not a single heir was born.

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,520
Could it be His Majesty

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,719
is... infertile?

63
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,360
Your Majesty, mind your words.

64
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,319
I won't speak of it.

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:58,960
Actually,

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,080
some concubines
did conceive royal heirs.

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,879
But for unknown reasons,

68
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,599
they either died young
or were stillborn.

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,439
None survived.

70
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,879
Early last year,
a concubine carried the imperial heir

71
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,439
and nearly reached full term,

72
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,640
but then overnight,

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
both the mother
and the child disappeared.

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
When they went to look,

75
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,960
the inquiry went nowhere.

76
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,319
The palace whispers

77
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,560
that the Regent orchestrated it.

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Didn't we agree?

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
If He An wants to remain emperor,

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,639
he must have no heirs.

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,479
So that's what the Regent meant.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,599
Why was this agreement made through me?

83
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,879
Is

84
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,879
the empress dowager

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,280
an accomplice?

86
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,919
But

87
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,000
why would the Regent do that?

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,159
Your Majesty,

89
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,360
His Majesty has reigned for three years.

90
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,840
He's now of age,

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
yet remains unmarried.

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,719
Why do you think that is?

93
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,680
It seems

94
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,960
the Regent don't want
to return power to His Majesty.

95
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,439
If an heir existed,

96
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,719
the empress selection ceremony
would commence.

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Thus,

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,879
he couldn't

99
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,680
legitimately control the court anymore.

100
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,479
Right?

101
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,680
What else?

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,599
It's not just the Regent.

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
Both the court and the harem

104
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,399
believe you also resist
returning power to His Majesty.

105
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,040
Otherwise...

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,959
Otherwise what?

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,879
Why haven't you
arranged His Majesty's marriage

108
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,040
but rule behind the curtain?

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
(So this is the 'agreement.')

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,120
No.

111
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,279
This means

112
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,319
I've been conspiring with the Regent?

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,759
Therefore,

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,720
Xiao Hu is the first

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,112
imperial heir

116
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,240
successfully born
since His Majesty's accession.

117
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,399
And it's a boy.

118
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,920
But I personally

119
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,824
returned him to His Majesty.

120
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,560
And I even made Cuizhu
act as his mother.

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,399
They say even tigers
don't eat their young.

122
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,639
Yet I

123
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,120
pushed my own child
to certain doom personally.

124
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,240
Had I known,

125
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,800
I should've clenched my jaw

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
and sent him out of the palace.

127
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,319
Your Majesty?

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I refuse to believe

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,319
I can't outplay these NPCs.

130
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:18,752
Your Majesty?

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,520
Your Majesty?

132
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,360
It's nothing.

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,360
I stood up too fast.

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,959
Your Majesty, have some tea.

135
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Right.

136
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,279
Oh my, you scared me!

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,879
Still haven't gone to bed?

138
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,120
I heard your talk

139
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,800
with the wet nurse

140
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,560
in the hall today.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,720
Don't worry.

142
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,600
Even if it costs my life,

143
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,392
I'll guard Your Majesty
and the First Prince.

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,560
Your Majesty and the First Prince

145
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,240
won't face dangers as before.

146
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,519
What does he mean?

147
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,336
Is he hinting at something?

148
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
If you're the father,

149
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
blink your eyes.

150
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,399
Are your eyes alright?

151
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,319
I'm sleepy.

152
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,319
Then rest early.

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
And you?

154
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,399
Guarding Your Majesty
and the First Prince

155
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
is my sworn duty.

156
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,920
It's chilly.

157
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,480
Rest early, Your Majesty.

158
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,560
(Isn't he exactly the cold outside)

159
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,800
(but warm inside,
loyal tsundere man in the dramas?)

160
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,959
(If he's the father,)

161
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,272
(that wouldn't be bad.)

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Your Majesty,

163
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,040
being distracted during chess

164
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,519
makes you lose.

165
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
Your reminder is wise.

166
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,560
So

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,439
that child becomes
an excellent strategic move.

168
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,639
A prince's safety is paramount.

169
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,639
Now he's under Her Majesty's care,

170
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,879
but I remain uneasy.

171
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,016
Would you

172
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,759
be the First Prince's tutor

173
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
and watch over him for me?

174
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:16,720
Your Majesty,

175
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,399
you lost.

176
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:37,839
What...

177
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,639
Greetings, Your Majesty.

178
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,319
Greetings, Your Majesty.

179
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,640
What brings you today

180
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,952
to my Yixiang Palace?

181
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
Your Majesty,

182
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
by His Majesty's decree:

183
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,439
the First Prince's education is vital.

184
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,104
From today on,

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,184
the Imperial Tutor
will stay in Yixiang Palace

186
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,360
to be the First Prince's tutor

187
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,280
and direct his daily studies.

188
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,744
Please arrange suitable quarters

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,696
within the inner palace

190
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,536
for instructional purposes.

191
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:04,815
Very well...

192
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:05,895
You,

193
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:09,096
prepare the First Prince's wing chamber.

194
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,335
And check if he is awake.

195
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,575
Wake him
for his apprenticeship ceremony.

196
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:14,616
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,095
(Am I dreaming?)

198
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:42,735
(These days of constant fear)

199
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:44,800
(might finally see hope.)

200
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:47,495
Isn't this what I've dreamed of?

201
00:08:48,855 --> 00:08:49,776
A family of three

202
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,936
living happily?

203
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:54,336
Your Majesty.

204
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:55,735
Your Majesty.

205
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,016
I shall commence the lessons.

206
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:01,335
Proceed.

207
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:02,848
Please withdraw.

208
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:04,615
Why?

209
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,335
Teaching requires undivided focus.

210
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,896
No outsiders permitted.

211
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,256
Your presence

212
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:10,936
would distract.

213
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,615
The First Prince's education is vital.

214
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,936
I must remain here

215
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:17,215
to ensure proper teaching.

216
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:18,335
Else,

217
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,215
how could I face our imperial ancestors?

218
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:23,095
Cheng Ziru, heed my decree.

219
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,416
From this day forth,

220
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:30,855
I shall observe proceedings here.

221
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:33,615
No interference
from others will be permitted.

222
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,495
I obey the decree.

223
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,256
Let's begin.

224
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,335
Click, click, and click again.

225
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,455
Mulan weaves by the door.

226
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,095
No sound of the loom's shuttle.

227
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:50,335
Only a maiden's sigh is heard.

228
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,696
The sky is dark, the earth yellow.

229
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,104
The cosmos is vast and primal.

230
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:57,656
The sun and moon wax and wane.

231
00:09:58,368 --> 00:09:59,872
Stars arrange their course.

232
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,735
Cold arrives, heat departs.

233
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,576
Autumn harvests, winter stores.

234
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:06,575
The sage's teachings...

235
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:08,495
Well...

236
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,936
The First Prince is tired today.

237
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:12,176
Class is dismissed.

238
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:13,855
Your Majesty,

239
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,176
about my teaching methods,

240
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,256
am I the decision-maker?

241
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:16,936
You are.

242
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,056
You've put the First Prince to sleep.

243
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,896
Are you sure your teaching methods

244
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:22,855
are without flaws?

245
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:25,575
Very well.

246
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,335
Class dismissed.

247
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:29,376
Wait.

248
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:36,495
I have decided

249
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:38,656
that I shall teach you

250
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,296
about early childhood stimulation.

251
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:42,208
Come on.

252
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:47,376
Your Majesty?

253
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:50,016
Had your teaching not been so dreary,

254
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:53,056
would I have had to
demonstrate personally?

255
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:55,056
Your Majesty.

256
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,215
Would you

257
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,936
be the First Prince's tutor

258
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,975
and watch over him for me?

259
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:34,376
Looks great.

260
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:35,360
Don't wipe it off.

261
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,608
It's teaching preparation.

262
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:38,048
