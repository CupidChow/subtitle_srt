22
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:32,879
that man cast upon you,

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,519
you will belong to me!

24
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,072
Don't come.

25
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,560
Don't come.

26
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:38,688
Ziru.

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:40,959
Ziru!

28
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,319
Nurse Liu! Nurse!

29
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:46,959
Your Majesty,

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,416
what do you need?

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,408
The Regent!

32
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,680
No! The physician said
you're not recovered.

33
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,352
Don't move.

34
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:52,879
No.

35
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,959
I need to save him,

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,359
or it'll be too late.

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,879
Your Majesty!

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,984
Your Majesty!

=Episode 16=

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,560
All of you, leave us.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,439
I need to speak with him privately.

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,879
- Yes.
- Yes.

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,960
You haven't fully recovered.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,919
You should have summoned me,

45
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,360
and I'd come to you.

46
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,039
I accept your terms.

47
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,159
Do you agree to marry me?

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,159
Yes.

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Release him first.

50
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:42,759
No hurry.

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,639
Marry me first,

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,120
and then he goes free.

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,719
Release him first,

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,719
and I'll marry you.

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,000
Rong,

56
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,159
you're treating our marriage
as a mere transaction!

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,680
Regent,

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,520
isn't that precisely what it is?

59
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,759
Very well.

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,919
I'll order his release immediately.

61
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,919
Satisfied?

62
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,400
Not enough.

63
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,439
I must go to the prison

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,439
to see your order to release him.

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,400
The prison is damp and filthy.

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
You haven't fully recovered.

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
Then I'll refuse.

68
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,599
Wait!

69
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,039
Her Majesty visits the dungeon!

70
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,240
Ziru.

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,039
Ziru.

72
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,080
Ziru.

73
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,639
Ziru.

74
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,360
Your Majesty.

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,319
Release him.

76
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,240
Release him.

77
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,159
Rong,

78
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,000
does your promise hold true?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,639
It does.

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,840
What did you agree to?

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Did he threaten you with me?

82
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,719
Don't yield to him, Rong.

83
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,680
Silence!

84
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,319
How dare you call her Rong?

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,319
Just her paramour.

86
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,159
She'll soon marry me.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,719
I said, release him.

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,696
I won't leave.

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,319
I'd rather die

90
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,959
than let you sacrifice yourself for me.

91
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:22,277
I...

92
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,959
Rong,

93
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,279
you see?

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
It's not me breaking promises.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,279
He refuses freedom himself.

96
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,120
Shall we grant his wish?

97
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,160
My prison has ample space regardless.

98
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,399
Fine.

99
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,720
Cheng Ziru, listen.

100
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,439
Even if you stay,

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
I'll still marry him.

102
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,079
It's your choice.

103
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,399
Leave or not.

104
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,439
Zhao Chengtian!

105
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,272
For a woman who doesn't love you

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
and a child who is not your own,

107
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,680
is this truly worth it?

108
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,120
What did you say?

109
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm the Empress Dowager's paramour,

110
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,560
so that child

111
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,600
could very well be mine, right?

112
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,839
Ziru.

113
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,040
Kill me! Do it!

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,040
- Kill me!
- Cheng Ziru!

115
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:20,279
Unhand her.

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,519
Unhand her!

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Is what he said true?

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,639
I'll kill him!

119
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,112
I'll kill that child!

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,199
I can prove

121
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,040
the First Prince
is your flesh and blood.

122
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,759
Then as I promised earlier,

123
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:35,879
I'll release him.

124
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:36,839
Good.

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
Give me three days.

126
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,240
In three days, I'll prove it to you.

127
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:44,288
But during these days,

128
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:46,879
you can't lay a finger on him.

129
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
I promise you.

130
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
Within three days,

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
I won't touch him.

132
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,399
But if you can't produce evidence,

133
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
he and the First Prince...

134
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,079
I won't let them live.

135
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,639
How can I prove this?

136
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,519
In this era,

137
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,199
there's no birth certificate

138
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,360
or official document.

139
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,399
Nurse Liu,

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,959
where are the Court Diaries

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,920
I asked you to prepare?

142
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,648
Your Majesty, they're all here.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,904
His Majesty arrives!

144
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,344
I heard you went to save Master.

145
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:46,399
Where is he?

146
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,096
Not saved yet.

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,839
Aren't you conspiring with the Regent

148
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,720
to kill Master?

149
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,040
Can't Your Majesty see through this?

150
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,439
If not for saving him...

151
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,160
Currently,

152
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
I can't rescue him alone.

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,199
We must work together.

154
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,439
Do you still treat me as a child?

155
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,399
Your affair with my uncle.

156
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,279
I've known all along.

157
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,439
Xiao Hu isn't my son,

158
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,600
but yours.

159
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,079
Master said Xiao Hu

160
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,600
wasn't the Regent's child,

161
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,079
but now, I think

162
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,639
he was deceived by you two.

163
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,519
That's why he's imprisoned now.

164
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,680
They say women are poisonous.

165
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
I didn't believe it,

166
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:29,600
but now,

167
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,560
your ruthlessness exceeds even that.

168
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,128
Say what you will about me,

169
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,792
but the Regent

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,360
isn't the father.

171
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,079
You keep lying now!

172
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,399
What must I do

173
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
to gain your cooperation

174
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,120
to save Master Chen?

175
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
First, prove the child
isn't the Regent's.

176
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,279
Before that,

177
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,120
you'll remain confined here.

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,079
You're confining me?

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,279
The Regent's ambition is known to all.

180
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
If you and Xiao Hu
aren't under my control,

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,839
and he rebels,

182
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,920
how could I protect myself?

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,360
Nurse Liu.

184
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:11,968
Your Majesty.

185
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:12,920
Sit.

186
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,784
What should I do?

187
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,560
You were injured earlier

188
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,519
and then suffered emotional distress.

189
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,919
But you're fine now.

190
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,360
Physician,

191
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,952
do you have my menstrual cycle records?

192
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,799
Yes.

193
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,792
(Records of the Empress Dowager's Menstrual Cycle)
All the records are here.

194
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,840
(Not right.)

195
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,759
(Whether with Ziru or the Regent,)

196
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,799
(she wasn't ovulating
during those times!)

197
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,960
(Pregnancy was impossible.)

198
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,639
Safe periods aren't reliable,

199
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,399
but...

200
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,088
Unless...

201
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,919
N-N-Nurse Liu.

202
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm here.

203
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,840
Go outside the palace

204
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,600
to find a trustworthy midwife.

205
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:31,328
What did you say?

206
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:31,879
Your Majesty,

207
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:34,799
your body shows no signs of childbirth.

208
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,600
Having delivered many babies,

209
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,200
I swear on my life.

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,440
Okay.

211
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,039
Never speak of this to anyone.

212
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,559
I'll remember.

213
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,960
Leave the palace.

214
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,960
The midwife said I never gave birth.

215
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,519
Then Xiao Hu...

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,720
Whose child is this?

217
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,639
Yours.

218
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,200
(How could her attendants mistake this?)

219
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,752
Send Rong to fetch four sets
of spring garments from the department.

220
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:08,096
Rong?

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,279
Nurse Liu! Biyu!

222
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:13,440
Your Majesty.

223
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,039
Your Majesty.

224
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,552
Is anything wrong?

225
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,639
Nurse Liu, answer me.

226
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,519
Who is Rong?

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,912
- Rong.
- Your Majesty.

228
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,639
Have you forgotten about Rong?

229
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
She was your personal maidservant.

230
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:25,039
But later, she
developed a strange illness,

231
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,679
and you sent her away.

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Strange illness?

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,679
What illness?

234
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
I don't know.

235
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,184
But I remember her refusing food

236
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
and vomiting constantly.

237
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,159
She became completely unrecognizable.

238
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,720
Captain Yu said
she shouldn't work anymore,

239
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
so she was sent out.

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,879
Tell me.

241
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,639
Where did Rong go after leaving?

242
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,960
Did you keep in touch?

243
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,440
Captain Yu handled everything back then.

244
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,799
He said she was sent
to her brother's house.

245
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,120
Rong once told me

246
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,120
she had no parents, only a brother,

247
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,360
who started a small business

248
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,592
in the suburbs
after she entered the palace,

249
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:01,568
Yu Feng!

250
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,464
Your Majesty.

251
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,296
Your Majesty.

252
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
You can't mention Rong to Captain Yu.

253
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,279
Why?

254
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,679
Rong is Captain Yu's forbidden topic.

255
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,600
He snaps at anyone who mentions her.

256
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,919
Just a few months ago,

257
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,960
over this very matter,

258
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,159
he beat up a fellow townsman.

259
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,600
Seems Yu Feng
is involved with her matter.

260
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,840
Find an eunuch you trust.

261
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,544
Investigate her brother's household.

262
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,088
Go now.

263
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,639
Yes.

264
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,799
I'll prepare
your medicine, Your Majesty.

265
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,039
Thank you.

266
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:43,639
(The 3rd Year of Ansheng, the 7th day of the tenth month
in the lunar calendar, Rong left)

267
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,792
(The 24th day of the eight month, Emperor drunk at Yixiang Palace)
Rong was expelled

268
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,240
less than two months
after the Emperor's night intrusion

269
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,720
at Yixiang Palace.

270
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,240
Could it be...

271
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,399
