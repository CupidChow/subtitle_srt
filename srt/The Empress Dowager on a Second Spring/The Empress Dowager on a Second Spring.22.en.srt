21

Let's talk this out.

22
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,736
Let her go.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,799
Zhao Chengtian, put it down!

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,319
Calm down.

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,952
Whatever you want.

26
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,792
Even if I die today,

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,376
I'll take you with me.

28
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,200
We'll be lovers in the underworld.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,120
Uncle.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
Drop the blades.

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Drop them!

32
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,632
I've waited so long for this day

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,200
to finally wed you honorably.

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,848
But all of you

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,760
have ruined it!

36
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,519
The Empress Dowager has long been mine.

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,680
She even bore me a child.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,296
None of you shall take her from me!

39
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,728
She never bore your child.

40
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,120
The First Prince is His Majesty's son.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,424
His mother was my maid Rong.

42
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,800
To protect the prince,

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
Rong met a tragic end.

44
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,039
The Empress Dowager
sacrificed her reputation.

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,520
Zhao Chengtian.

46
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,759
How many people
and children have you killed

47
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,960
in this palace?

48
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,832
No.

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,792
No!

50
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,280
You're lying.

51
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,352
You're lying, right?

52
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,712
The First Prince is my flesh and blood!

53
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,680
Jiang Rong also belongs to me!

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,479
Why didn't I meet you first

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,656
in the imperial garden back then?

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,824
What?

57
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:15,960
Your Grace,

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,599
this is the concubine
the Crown Prince selected today.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
From our first meeting,

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,232
you imprinted on my heart.

61
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,039
I never regret

62
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,800
meeting you.

63
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,039
Don't!

64
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,272
Uncle.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,560
No.

66
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,680
Save him! Save...

67
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,599
Don't...

68
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,048
Don't save me.

69
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,879
I never wanted the throne.

70
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,304
I did this for you.

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,760
If we meet again

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,719
in our next life...

73
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,392
Zhao Chengtian.

74
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,096
Don't

75
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,656
let us miss each other,

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,504
okay?

77
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:46,263
=Episode 22=

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,720
Zhao Chengtian.

79
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,639
(Two years later)
Now, the war ends.

80
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,680
The world is at peace.

81
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,759
This is the prosperity we envisioned.

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,136
About your "next life" proposal,

83
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,928
I'll need time to think.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,688
But

85
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:01,504
let's save next-life discussions
for next life.

86
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,879
I want to live this life well,

87
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,560
live every single day well.

88
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,816
It's getting late.

89
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's depart.

90
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,560
Wait.

91
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:16,320
Zhao Chengtian.

92
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
(Tomb of the Regent)

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,616
His Majesty selected a royal clan child

94
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,079
to carry your lineage.

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,752
When he comes of age,

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,519
he'll come to visit you instead.

97
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,624
You have a descendant.

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,064
Go.

99
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,720
Why are you here?

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,279
As the Crown Prince's tutor,

101
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,519
shouldn't you be guarding him?

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,639
Why come here?

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,728
When will you be back?

104
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,079
I knew I couldn't hide it from you.

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,199
I didn't tell anyone

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
because I couldn't bear the goodbye.

107
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,680
When will you come back?

108
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,600
When I miss Xiao Hu,

109
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,800
I'll return.

110
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
You ran here earlier,

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,319
like when you were a child.

112
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,992
Child?

113
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,639
How so?

114
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,328
Clear-eyed, carefree.

115
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:28,160
Yu Feng.

116
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,519
Stop!

117
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,232
Put me down!

118
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,408
Seeing you this happy

119
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,000
makes me happy too.

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,856
Thank you

121
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
for protecting me.

122
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
You should leave now.

123
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,450
Before I change my mind

124
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,728
and kill Cheng Ziru.

125
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Come! Hurry!

126
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,520
Let's go.

127
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,176
Don't miss me too much.

128
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,680
Winter is almost here.

129
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,920
I wonder how He An and Xiao Hu

130
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,776
are doing.

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,480
If you want to return,

132
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,240
I'll accompany you.

133
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,160
I just miss Xiao Hu.

134
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,968
Besides,

135
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,792
everything in the palace

136
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,639
is no longer our concern.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,199
How can you say that?

138
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,839
Have you forgotten?

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,440
We swore before my sister.

140
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,176
As long as we are alive,

141
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,056
we'll protect He An and his reign.

142
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,919
Really?

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
I don't remember that.

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,224
You and she were like sisters,

145
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,792
and on her deathbed,

146
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,448
she summoned us
to entrust her son to us.

147
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:49,504
Did you forget?

148
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,679
I invited you here today

149
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,480
to ask a favor of you both.

150
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,320
Your Majesty,

151
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,320
there's nothing
we can't discuss between us.

152
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,368
Sister.

153
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,968
What are you doing?

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I know full well

155
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,559
my health.

156
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
It is already at its limit.

157
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,448
Your Majesty.

158
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,568
I want to request

159
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,168
that after my death,

160
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,144
you two take my son under your care,

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,039
so he may survive

162
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,960
in this merciless palace.

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,399
I know it's difficult,

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,016
especially with the Regent
watching closely.

165
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,864
I wonder if you two

166
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,159
would agree to this.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,520
Come.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,472
Sit.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,608
I promise you.

170
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,384
I swear

171
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,136
as long as I remain in the harem,

172
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,408
I'll keep him safe.

173
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,184
Sister,

174
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,352
I'll protect He An.

175
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,016
So

176
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,799
the Empress Dowager was remarkable.

177
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,080
A heroine!

178
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,279
Absolutely.

179
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,736
But

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,296
your memory is really bad now.

181
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,240
What do you mean?

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,320
You even forgot

183
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,200
our first time.

184
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,200
You...

185
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,008
But I remember
all the crucial things, don't I?

186
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,664
Rong,

187
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,039
you've suffered

188
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,039
a lot.

189
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,919
It was worth it.

190
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,360
If you want to return,

191
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,632
I'll go back with you.

192
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,504
Didn't you mention

193
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:14,560
migratory retirement?

194
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,279
We could stay in the palace

195
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,000
during winter to enjoy warm service

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,759
and go to the hills
in summer to cool off.

197
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,056
Like migrants.

198
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,759
That sounds good,

199
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,872
but

200
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,464
I'm the Empress Dowager.

201
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
My return is expected.

202
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,679
What identity would you use to return?

203
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,759
As the Emperor's uncle?

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
Yeah.

205
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,656
Wait,

206
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,120
don't I have another role?

207
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,648
Your male consort.

208
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,720
I knew you'd mention that.

209
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,128
Any regrets?

210
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,159
None whatsoever.

211
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,879
I regret nothing of all this.

212
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,000
We often can't distinguish
right from wrong.

213
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,840
All we can do

214
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,928
is let flowers be flowers,

215
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,880
trees be trees,

216
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,376
clouds be clouds,

217
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:15,776
and let us

218
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,039
be us.

219
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,559
Awake.

220
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,519
It went smoothly.

221
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,200
A boy, 3.35 kg.

222
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,159
Successful surgery.

223
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,799
I'm your attending physician,

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
Cheng Ziru.

225
00:13:13,472 --> 00:13:18,368
