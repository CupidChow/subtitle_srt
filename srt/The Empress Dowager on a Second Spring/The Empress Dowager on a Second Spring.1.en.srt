Abnormal position.

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,959
Prepare oxytocin.

Push.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,560
Baby delivered successfully.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,760
She is exhausted.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120

Jiang Rong.

00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,959
Jiang Rong.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
(Jiang Rong, Empress Dowager)

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,359
Who are you?

34
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,280
Your Majesty.

35
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,976
You're finally awake.

36
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,920
You've slept for too long.

37
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:49,959
Thank goodness.

38
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,239
- Thank goodness.
- Well,

39
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,640
who are you?

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,040
Your Majesty.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,239
How could you forget your own maid?

42
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,760
(Liu Meng, Wet Nurse)
I'm your childhood wet nurse!

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,000
Your personal attendants.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,224
(Biyu, Maid)

45
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:00,840
Biyu.

46
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,239
(Cuizhu, Maid)
Cuizhu.

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,879
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?

48
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,039
Don't tell me I...

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
died?

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,719
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,616
Your Majesty.

52
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,319
The baby's been eating more and more.

53
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,520
He must be hungry.

54
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,199
Whose baby?

55
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Yours.

56
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,960
Mine?

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,360
Boy or girl?

58
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,439
A boy.

59
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,319
My son?

60
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,400
Right.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,759
(So... that's childbirth?)

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,560
(It feels almost like nothing happened.)

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,439
(Unless...)

64
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,159
(ancient people's bodies
work differently from ours?)

65
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:52,320
Be careful, Your Majesty.

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,976
Though you've always been healthy,

67
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,560
caution is still wise.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,680
Did misfortune
turn into a blessing for me?

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,280
God is too kind to me.

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,639
(Consort)
I'm a consort

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,520
(Son)
with a son.

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
(Status Through Son)
A son elevates the mother.

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,080
Does this mean I will...

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
become the Empress?

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,759
Your Majesty.

76
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,319
Please go see the baby boy.

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
Consider it a farewell.

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,319
Farewell?

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,759
Why?

80
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Trust me, Your Majesty.

81
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
Leave everything to me.

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
The guard captain
will sneak him out from the back door.

83
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,599
Wait.

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,879
This isn't your decision to make.

85
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,800
Only the Emperor can decide.

86
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,280
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

87
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,199
The Emperor must never learn of this!

88
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,919
Why not?

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
In all dynastic history,

90
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,616
there's no precedent
for an empress dowager giving birth.

91
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:48,919
- None.
- None.

92
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,440
Hold on.

93
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,080
Who am I?

94
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,120
- Empress Dowager.
- Empress Dowager.

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,240
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

96
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,560
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

97
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:02,272
=Episode 1=

98
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,352
Empress Dowager.

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,000
Ma'am.

100
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,120
Ma'am.

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,599
I...

102
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,599
The childbirth left me

103
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,120
drained, so I lost my memory.

104
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,879
You'll answer whatever I ask now.

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,439
The Empress Dowager
means the Emperor's mother.

106
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

107
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,759
You're the Emperor's mother.

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,120
Technically, stepmother.

109
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,279
How old are we?

110
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,920
The Emperor's 18. You're 28.

111
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,560
Is the Retired Emperor still alive?

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,160
The Retired Emperor
passed three years ago.

113
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,240
In other words,

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm a widow.

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,759
An empress dowager with a child

116
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,720
of unknown parentage!

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

120
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:49,088
Your Majesty.

121
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:49,792
Your Majesty.

122
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:51,399
The priority now

123
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,088
is to send away this baby boy.

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,639
He must leave.

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,839
How?

126
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,120
- His Majesty is here!
- Quickly!

127
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,279
Your Majesty, hurry!

128
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,639
Quick!

129
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,480
This way.

130
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,879
This way, this way.

131
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:02,800
I...

132
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,304
Lie down.

133
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:07,120
Lie down.

134
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:07,839
I...

135
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,225
Your Majesty.

136
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,000
(He An, Emperor)

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How is my mother?

138
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:27,319
Why does she look so pale?

139
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,959
Wasn't it just a cold?

140
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,800
Why isn't she getting better?

141
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,279
What are those physicians doing?

142
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,279
Are they tired of living?

143
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,560
Someone!

144
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,560
Go summon them!

145
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,000
W-W-Wait!

146
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,600
Wait.

147
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,079
Your Majesty.

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,120
I've recovered already.

149
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,759
No need to trouble the physicians.

150
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,920
But you've been bedridden for days.

151
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,879
Without your presence in the court,

152
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,560
I cannot feel at ease.

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,680
(What?)

154
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,519
(I'm a widow, and I even have to work?)

155
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,439
Then rest and recuperate.

156
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,879
You can return to court

157
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,600
after you recover.

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
Alright.

159
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,040
I won't disturb your rest further.

160
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,352
Feed Xiao Hu something.

161
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,759
Don't let it keep crying like this.

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,360
May I ask

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,000
who Xiao Hu is?

164
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,240
Xiao Hu is...

165
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,199
He's...

166
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,040
One day, while I was bathing,

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,040
suddenly,

168
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,199
I saw this enormous tail...

169
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,360
As you know,

170
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,240
I've always feared...

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,199
Rats.

172
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,560
So I kept

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
- a big tabby cat
- A big tabby cat.

174
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,279
to help me

175
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,800
- Catch rats.
- Catch rats.

176
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,959
Your Majesty, your recent anxieties

177
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,944
must stem from these rat issues.

178
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,672
I will feed the cat.

179
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:01,000
Good.

180
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:01,839
Good.

181
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,439
I see.

182
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,160
My mistake

183
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,560
of being unaware of your distress.

184
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm unfilial.

185
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,279
Nothing.

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,519
You're the Emperor.

187
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,240
You're busy.

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,279
I understand.

189
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,199
I'm exhausted.

190
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,360
I need to rest now.

191
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,720
You may attend to your duties.

192
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,160
I'll take my leave.

193
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,839
Hurry!

194
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,160
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

195
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,000
Has he gone?

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,960
Long gone now.

197
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,959
- Long gone now.
- Good.

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,639
Your Majesty,

199
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,920
we can't keep this baby boy.

200
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,439
Right!

201
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,279
I've decided to send him out.

202
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:50,839
Good.

203
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,160
Have him sent away tonight.

204
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:52,920
No!

205
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,439
I meant,

206
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,759
send him to his biological father.

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,480
What?

208
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
You don't know who his father is?

209
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,560
Your Majesty,

210
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,199
you often wandered alone

211
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,439
without attendants.

212
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,040
Truly, we don't know

213
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,319
who fathered this child.

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,360
But you surely know

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,480
who I interacted with the most?

216
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
- Captain.
- Regent.

217
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,839
Guard captain.

218
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,600
Regent.

219
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,160
Captain.

220
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,839
- Captain!
- Regent!

221
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,759
- Captain!
- Regent!

222
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,679
Stop this nonsense.

223
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,679
Let them speak freely.

224
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,840
The guard captain

225
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,399
is the one stationed at our gate.

226
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,600
(Yu Feng, Guard Captain)
His name is Yu Feng.

227
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,440
He is your childhood sweetheart.

228
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,120
He could have become a general
after winning the military examination.

229
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,840
But he willingly chose
to serve as a palace guard,

230
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600
finally rising to become the captain.

231
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,279
The late Emperor trusted him implicitly.

232
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,720
After you became the Empress Dowager,

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
he volunteered

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,360
to guard our palace himself.

235
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,440
Even when promoted by His Majesty,
he refused to leave.

236
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,279
He's your most loyal devotee.

237
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,000
Regarding your childbirth,

238
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
not only was he aware,

239
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,000
but he even got a midwife for you.

240
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,480
To maintain secrecy,

241
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,679
during your delivery,

242
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,720
we were even barred from entering.

243
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,559
He knows such critical secrets.

244
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,559
Our relationship must be extraordinary.

245
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,240
What about that regent?

246
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,039
Regent?

247
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,559
That lecherous regent

248
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,399
isn't fit to be mentioned

249
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,000
alongside the guard captain.

250
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,840
Nonsense!

251
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,279
The regent is dashing

252
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,279
and handsome.

253
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,360
He's the most powerful statesman.

254
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:51,200
(Zhao Chengtian, Regent)

255
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,159
His presence

256
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,720
ensures your regency.

257
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Only through his influence

258
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,399
does the Emperor dare not oppose you.

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Why would the Emperor target me?

260
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,399
Because of my involvement in court?

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
I'll simply return my power to him...

262
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,919
Don't say that!

263
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Never relinquish
your power to the Emperor.

264
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,840
While presiding over court,

265
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,240
you hold absolute authority.

266
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,279
The Emperor cannot harm you.

267
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,320
Are you suggesting

268
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,480
there's unresolved enmity between us?

269
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,559
This matter

270
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:30,360
requires lengthy explanation.

271
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,704
Then summarize it concisely.

272
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:33,720
At double speed!

273
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,064
Yes.

274
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:35,680
His Majesty's birth mother

275
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,898
got a mysterious illness

276
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:37,536
and then died.

277
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,560
You became the Empress.

278
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Then

279
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,160
rumors linked you

280
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,312
to the late Empress's death.

281
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:42,879
How else would you have risen?

282
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,279
Yes.

283
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm responsible
for the Emperor's mother's death?

284
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,559
God!

285
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,576
Just take me now!

286
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,879
Your Majesty.

287
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,759
Your Majesty.

288
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,256
What are you thinking?

289
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,264
Then,

290
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,600
besides those two,

291
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
are there others?

292
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,648
(He's the Emperor's tutor.)

293
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:16,919
(Cheng Ziru.)

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,399
(This man)

295
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,960
(remains unmoved by worldly splendor,)

296
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,519
(and his gaze was only
fixed on noble ideals.)

297
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,039
(Untainted by mortal concerns.)

298
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,888
