=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,640
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,519
Her Majesty is right.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,736
Yixiang Palace's Court Diaries
have documented all daily activities.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,239
Your Majesty will see
upon reviewing them.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
(Court Diaries)

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,200
Well...

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,959
It's written clearly in black and white.

28
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,159
Would you disregard
my sincere intentions?

29
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:39,439
(Court Diaries)

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,840
Since you are unwell,

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,680
I won't burden you further.

32
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,760
We must carefully
deliberate today's matter.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,280
Until the truth is revealed,

34
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,400
the child shall remain under your care.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,120
Farewell, Your Majesty.

36
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:01,230
(Court Diaries)

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,599
What...

38
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:10,656
=Episode 4=

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,159
Cuizhu and I...

40
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,240
I know nothing.

41
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:25,728
That night...

42
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,840
I truly don't know.

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
When exactly did I ever...

44
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,039
Forget it.

45
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,280
You know nothing.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,520
Leave me.

47
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,719
Yes.

48
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,479
Wait.

49
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,560
Summon Master now.

50
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,759
Yes.

51
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,360
Are you certain
this document isn't forged?

52
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,680
Your Majesty jests again.

53
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,719
How could
such official records be forged?

54
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,639
Now I recall.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,544
His Majesty drank heavily that night.

56
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,240
Exactly.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,879
He embraced you
and wept bitterly upon entering.

58
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,479
Empress Dowager.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,680
Empress Dowager.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,199
How could you make such claims?

61
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,159
You've left me no dignity as Emperor.

62
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,000
And then?

63
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,879
Then...

64
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,919
I withdrew from the chamber.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,919
You...

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,960
I also withdrew.

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,120
Obviously. I needn't ask further.

68
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Aren't you the least bit curious?

69
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,520
No interest in gossip at all?

70
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,840
All of you...

71
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,240
You people!

72
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,072
(Court Diaries)

73
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
I don't know why

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,159
His Majesty came wailing
to me that night,

75
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,479
but the timing proves fortunate.

76
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,919
I'll temporarily claim the child as his.

77
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,599
This should

78
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,280
secure our survival for now.

79
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,159
Your Majesty?

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,800
Your Majesty?

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,319
The Court Diaries...

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,319
Okay.

83
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,120
Never mind.

84
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:05,632
First establish
His Majesty's status as the father

85
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:06,719
beyond dispute.

86
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:08,680
Leaving him
no immediate recourse for denial.

87
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,000
As for the true father,

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,439
he must be identified swiftly.

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Lest I face endless complications.

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Greetings, Your Majesty.

91
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,000
Master,

92
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,439
regarding the child,

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,759
what do you think?

94
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,920
An heir

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
blesses the throne.

96
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,000
But whether it's my son

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,839
remains uncertain.

98
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,680
Succession affects state affairs.

99
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,360
How could fraud exist?

100
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,079
In the Empress Dowager's place,

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,279
I got drunk.

102
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,879
No memory remains.

103
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,439
Her Majesty

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,920
would never deceive you.

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,399
Master, recall
how my birth mother perished.

106
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,480
You imply...

107
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,720
I imply nothing.

108
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,600
In the palace,

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
too many conspiracies and mysteries.

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,319
I trust none

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,959
but you.

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
For Your Majesty,

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
I'd die without hesitation.

114
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,920
The imperial bloodline
requires certainty.

115
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,879
Despite limitations,

116
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll not tolerate deception.

117
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,120
But my mind remains clouded.

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,879
I don't know how to handle it.

119
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
Advise me on this matter.

120
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,079
An imperial heir

121
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,240
is favorable.

122
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,079
Acknowledge the child first.

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,616
When the occasion permits,

124
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:29,279
I'll go to the Empress Dowager's palace

125
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,639
to uncover the truth.

126
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,879
As you advise.

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,480
The imperial decree has arrived!

128
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,120
Palace maid Cuizhu,
receive the imperial decree.

129
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Palace maid Cuizhu

130
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,600
is gracious, virtuous,

131
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,120
wise, and benevolent.

132
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,040
Having now borne an imperial heir,

133
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,439
she's been conferred the title
of Noble Lady Zhu

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
and granted residence
at Chunxi Hall in Jinxiu Palace.

135
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,920
So it is decreed.

136
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,439
Your Ladyship,

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,759
accept the decree now.

138
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,160
I thank His Majesty.

139
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,680
His Majesty has ennobled Cuizhu?

140
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,480
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,439
Cuizhu's great fortune
earns her imperial favor.

142
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:16,480
Now,

143
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,272
she's Noble Lady Zhu.

144
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,439
Well...

145
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,079
How could His Majesty ennoble you?

146
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,639
Haven't I ruined you?

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,120
Your Majesty,

148
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,400
to receive imperial favor

149
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,519
was always my goal
in entering the palace.

150
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,360
I can't thank Your Majesty enough.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,879
Good then.

152
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,560
But...

153
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,360
I didn't give birth to the child.

154
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,240
I am still a maiden.

155
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,279
If His Majesty discovers this,

156
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,120
it'd mean death
for deceiving the throne.

157
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,560
Cuizhu,

158
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,040
rest easy as a noble lady.

159
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,040
I'll handle the rest.

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,319
But Your Majesty,

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,279
if the truth comes out...

162
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,399
Don't worry.

163
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,279
His Majesty has countless concubines.

164
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,680
It won't be your turn anytime soon.

165
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,399
But what if...

166
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,160
if...

167
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,720
What if...

168
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,759
it's...

169
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,920
Your turn?

170
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,608
I...

171
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,360
Well...

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,920
I'll teach you prepared responses.

173
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,720
Will this work?

174
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,439
It will.

175
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,856
If it fails,

176
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,040
just expose my involvement.

177
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,959
This mess began with me anyway.

178
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,360
But

179
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,920
remember:

180
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,959
Stay humble and act cautiously daily.

181
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,040
Remain as unnoticed as air.

182
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,888
(Yixiang Palace)

183
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Your Grace, please return first.

184
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,279
Her Majesty has retired.

185
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,279
Your Grace!

186
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,680
Your Majesty!

187
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,992
His Grace insisted on coming in.

188
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,759
I couldn't stop him.

189
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,360
It's alright. Leave us.

190
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

191
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,399
What brings you here

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
at this hour?

193
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:38,639
Have you forgotten your promise to me?

194
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,360
(Are we going straight
to the final exam?)

195
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:44,080
(How would I know her promise?)

196
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,039
I promised...

197
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,399
I...

198
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,879
Didn't we agree?

199
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,200
If He An wants to remain emperor,

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
he must have no heirs.

201
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,519
Yet you

202
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,399
went behind my back to have him seduced

203
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,399
and produce an heir.

204
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,879
Your Grace,

205
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,559
regarding this matter,

206
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,399
you truly wrong me.

207
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,200
If I aimed to have him seduced,

208
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
I wouldn't use my own maid.

209
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,984
Right?

210
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,159
Moreover,

211
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,039
His Majesty is of age.

212
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,879
I can't control his...

213
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,879
Right?

214
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,559
So this child

215
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,519
is genuinely unexpected.

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,720
Unexpected?

217
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,320
You think 'unexpected' fools me?

218
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,080
Can you two even protect this child?

219
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,879
Your Grace,

220
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,679
you're hurting me.

221
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,679
What are you doing?

222
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,519
It's just a child.

223
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,159
Why vent on a child?

224
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:47,799
I've said it.

225
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,279
I can explain.

226
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,519
Explain?

227
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,360
Didn't you say 'unexpected'?

228
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,440
Then let me

229
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
dispose of this illegitimate

230
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,679
offspring.

231
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,960
Then you can explain.

232
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,279
No!

233
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,559
Are you alright?

234
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,879
It's you again.

235
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,080
You dare attempt assassination
against me?

236
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Are you a rebel?

237
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
It seems the true rebel here is you.

238
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,559
Me? Rebel?

239
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,440
You're defending

240
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,559
an assassin

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
and speaking nonsense.

242
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,240
It's unacceptable!

243
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
You've seen clearly.

244
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,399
This child is His Majesty's
newly born royal heir.

245
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,159
His birth mother is recognized.

246
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,200
You attempted to murder
an imperial heir late at night.

247
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Hadn't Yu Feng caught him

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,720
and this child had come to harm,

249
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,799
the charge of regicide

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,960
would be beyond your capacity to bear!

251
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,799
I won't let this matter slide so easily.

252
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,240
No more obsessing

253
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,639
over those real-life heartthrobs.

254
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,816
I was so scared.

255
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,760
Your Grace.

256
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,360
Yes.

257
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,072
Your Grace.

258
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,320
It's news from Yixiang Palace.

259
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,759
Keep a close watch on there.

260
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,399
Report

261
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
upon any activity.

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,600
Yes.

263
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,360
(Yixiang Palace)

264
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,279
This child cannot remain in the palace.

265
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,960
Previously, due to his unknown origins,

266
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,200
we hid him to conceal his existence.

267
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,080
But now that he's been
publicly acknowledged,

268
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,039
staying in the palace is safest for him.

269
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,159
The Regent's spies permeate the harem!

270
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,848
The First Prince narrowly escaped.

271
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,840
Who knows

272
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,960
what schemes he will use?

273
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,120
Moreover,

274
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,080
the children who've died by his hand

275
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,399
number more than a few.

276
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,360
What... what did you say?

277
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,559
What has the regent done in the harem?

278
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,464
I beg Your Majesty to permit me
to take the prince from the palace.
