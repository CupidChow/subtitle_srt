=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,319
What's wrong?

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,496
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,640
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Mr. Cheng is speaking to you.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,824
Are you here

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,552
to see His Majesty?

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,239
Yes...

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,799
No...

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,570
I...

30
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,239
I recently got some red ginseng.

31
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,280
You have court duties

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,992
and teaching obligations.

33
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:01,952
It's hard work.

34
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,359
I specially made this for you.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,040
Resolving His Majesty's queries

36
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,640
is my duty.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,159
I claim no credit.

38
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,719
Then

39
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,800
t-t-the soup...

40
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,439
I have excessive heat within.

41
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,039
Ginseng is not advisable.

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
But if you insist,

43
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll drink it.

44
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,560
No... No need to drink that then.

45
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,960
Thank you.

46
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,879
I shall take my leave now.

47
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,344
One, two, three, four, five, six...

48
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:41,920
Your Majesty.

49
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,719
You have feelings for him?

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
But he does not like you.

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,759
What a shame then.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,599
Then let's investigate
those closest first.

53
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:06,624
=Episode 2=

54
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,960
Captain Yu, Her Majesty
is tired and thirsty.

55
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,240
We are ordered

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,159
to fetch plum juice
and a cushioned stool.

57
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,960
Please watch over Her Majesty.

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,120
(How cold!)

59
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,439
Regarding Xiao Hu's parentage,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,840
what's your view?

61
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,680
I follow your view

62
00:03:59,136 --> 00:03:59,808
completely.

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
You startled me!

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,319
There are no outsiders here.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,232
Regarding this,

66
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:08,608
speak candidly.

67
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,479
Your Majesty!

68
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,519
My foot!

69
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,519
What happened?

70
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,839
Her ankle is sprained.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Go get the wet nurse for a cold compress

72
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:51,480
and a physician.

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,959
Yes.

74
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,199
How is your injury?

75
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,839
I failed to protect you.

76
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,879
Well...

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
Thank you, Captain.

78
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:01,120
Captain?

79
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,600
My duty.

80
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,839
Regarding the child,

81
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,120
what's your view?

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
You're acting strange.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,319
You formally addressed me.

84
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:17,088
You're bothered
by my way of calling you?

85
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,519
You never called me that before.

86
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:20,160
Such formality today...

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,680
Then what did I call you before?

88
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
Did you forget?

89
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,279
I...

90
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:30,912
I'm not her. How would I know?

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,639
Quick!

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,720
Carry her inside!

93
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,240
Captain! You can't enter!

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,264
What haven't I entered?

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,160
Tell me.

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Where have you been?

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,839
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,160
I-I-I acted rashly.

99
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,680
What's he doing?

100
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:14,839
He...

101
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,639
For the truth,

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,720
endure it.

103
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,279
Persevere.

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,399
Persevere.

105
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,680
Persevere more.

106
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,160
It hurts.

107
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,399
What...

108
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,319
are you doing?

109
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,399
Thank you.

110
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,879
The oath I swore
in your chambers that day

111
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,160
remains eternal.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
An oath?

113
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,232
What?

114
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,680
I'll be gentler!

115
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,319
It hurts.

116
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,392
Your Majesty, such carelessness!

117
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,920
Your Majesty, did you uncover anything?

118
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:06,319
No.

119
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,240
How do I usually

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,920
address the guard captain?

121
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,160
Captain Yu, same as us all.

122
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,560
What else would it be?

123
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:21,564
Then...

124
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,199
in private?

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,639
I don't know.

126
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:27,584
I know.

127
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:30,208
Once, I accidentally overheard it.

128
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,879
You privately call Captain Yu...

129
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,600
Feng.

130
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,199
Feng?

131
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,280
There must be something

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,319
between them.

133
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
The key question is,

134
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,800
is he the father?

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,879
(Feng...)

136
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,120
Feng.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,608
(From Regent Zhao Chengtian)
The regent wants to see you.

138
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:10,680
Shall we accept?

139
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes.

140
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:16,959
This time,

141
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,519
you two must tell me

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,032
what I call him

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,680
in private.

144
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,488
(I can only)

145
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,080
(rely on myself finally.)

146
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,759
Your Grace.

147
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,480
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

148
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,639
Rong,

149
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,799
it's been hard.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,279
No one else is here.

151
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,480
No formalities.

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,840
Why so formal

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,440
(What?)

154
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,320
after days apart?

155
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
(Rong?)

156
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
(Something's brewing!)

157
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,799
What do you mean, Your Grace?

158
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,440
Your prolonged illness

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,360
concerned me deeply.

160
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,879
I heard about the rat infestation.

161
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
If I had known,

162
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,320
I would have moved you to my place.

163
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,519
How can a brother-in-law
and a sister-in-law live together?

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,704
Or...

165
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,272
the two of them...

166
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,720
Rong.

167
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,639
What are you thinking?

168
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,440
The rats are manageable.

169
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,519
Thank you for your concern.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,080
We're apart all day long.

171
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,480
How could I not worry?

172
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
(Oh! What's he doing?)

173
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,458
No, I...

174
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,680
Wait, I...

175
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,000
The night breeze grows chill.

176
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,000
You just recovered.

177
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,840
Take care

178
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,399
not to relapse.

179
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You live alone.

180
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,840
Care for your health.

181
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,399
Once I complete that thing,

182
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,879
we'll never part again.

183
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,559
Have you considered my proposal?

184
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,399
(Oh, no!)

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,799
(Closed-book exam!)

186
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,600
That thing?

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,799
What are you

188
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,159
referring to?

189
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,480
The thing

190
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,248
that can legitimately bring us together.

191
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,639
Oh my!

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,120
The brother-in-law
and sister-in-law rumor is confirmed!

193
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,240
But wait.

194
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,320
The Empress Dowager hasn't consented.

195
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Regarding this matter,

196
