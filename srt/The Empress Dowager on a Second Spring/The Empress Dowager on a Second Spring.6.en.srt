we...

24
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,439
Alright.

25
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,656
The lessons may continue tomorrow.

26
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:45,480
Wait.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,992
I have a question.

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
Do you have a problem with me?

29
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,400
How come?

30
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,959
That day in the archives,

31
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,359
you seemed quite resistant toward me.

32
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,400
I want to know why.

33
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,760
Have you forgotten
our agreement, Your Majesty?

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,599
What agreement?

35
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,599
No need to play dumb.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,439
If spoken, some things

37
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,352
could cost one's head.

38
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,319
Then

39
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,199
I'm even more curious

40
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,840
about what happened before.

41
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,280
But I believe

42
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,000
current matters are more pressing,
aren't they?

43
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,744
What current matters?

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,200
Lineage.

45
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,159
The First Prince's lineage

46
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,199
has nothing suspicious.

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,824
Is that so?

48
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,400
Is it you who have doubts,

49
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,616
or His Majesty?

50
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,159
Don't move.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Don't you think

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,520
your features
closely resemble the First Prince's?

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,184
Your Majesty jests.

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,000
How could I

55
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,039
resemble the First Prince?

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,648
As the First Prince is asleep,

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,152
I shall take my leave.

58
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,608
Is it truly a blind spot
right under my nose?

59
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:35,104
=Episode 6=

60
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,248
Your Majesty,

61
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:44,120
you've been watching
the First Prince all night.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,696
Is something wrong?

63
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,759
Who do you think

64
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,592
the First Prince resembles?

65
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,000
Xiao Hu was born by Your Majesty,

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
so naturally he resembles you.

67
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,719
Although His Majesty
has acknowledged Xiao Hu,

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,560
from Mr. Cheng's implication,

69
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,719
His Majesty isn't entirely convinced.

70
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,879
After all,

71
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,584
what's fake can't be real.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,200
We must quickly
find his biological father.

73
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,696
But the First Prince is still young.

74
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,680
I truly cannot tell whom he resembles.

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,879
Why are you scurrying?

76
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,920
Eunuch Fuji went to Mr. Cheng.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,079
I tried to listen.

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,279
I only heard mentions
of His Majesty and the Regent

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
and couldn't make out more.

80
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,416
To not cause delay,

81
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,879
I reported immediately.

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
The Regent?

83
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,888
Jiang Rong,

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,879
have you

85
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,279
been too comfortable lately?

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,439
Have you forgotten

87
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,120
danger lurks
at every turn in the palace?

88
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,480
If it involves the Regent,

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,199
it can't be anything good.

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,759
Biyu, let's go eavesdrop.

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,560
Okay.

92
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,712
Steady Her Majesty.

93
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,696
Perhaps

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,288
we should have His Majesty summon her.

95
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,888
You mean

96
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:00,128
to have Cuizhu serve His Majesty?

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,120
Let's go.

98
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,519
In case you're thirsty,

99
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,856
I've prepared the White Dew tea
from Western Hills

100
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,000
to quench your thirst.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,360
Eunuch Fuji must also be weary.

102
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,399
Join us for a cup.

103
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,839
Master,

105
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,432
come quickly with me.

106
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,519
The First Prince woke up
crying incessantly

107
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,240
and demands you.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The First Prince

109
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,360
wants me?

110
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,079
But I'm truly occupied here.

111
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,759
What matter could be

112
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,319
more important than the First Prince?

113
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,639
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,759
by imperial decree,

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,959
I'm to escort the Imperial Tutor
to Qingliang Hall

116
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,560
for urgent consultation.

117
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,839
He sent him here

118
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,279
and now repeatedly summons him away.

119
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,199
My son likely has no support...

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,360
in the imperial court anymore.

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
I can't defy an imperial decree.

122
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,399
The First Prince can only

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
turn to Your Majesty now.

124
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,160
Thank you.

125
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:17,079
(Yixiang Palace)

126
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,879
Your Majesty.

127
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,439
Your Majesty, help!

128
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,160
Your Majesty! Bad news!

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,759
What's wrong?

130
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,752
Your Majesty!

131
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,079
- What's wrong?
- Your Majesty!

132
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,040
Your Majesty,

133
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
His Majesty is visiting Jinxiu Palace.

134
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,959
What should we do?

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Your Majesty, we just received news.

136
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,839
His Majesty chose Noble Lady Zhu
for tonight.

137
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,839
Why did His Majesty choose you?

138
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,759
I don't know, either.

139
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
Upon entering Jinxiu Palace,

140
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,519
I've followed your instructions

141
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,600
and never stepped
beyond the inner chambers,

142
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,439
striving to be completely unnoticeable.

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
I don't know why

144
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,079
His Majesty suddenly remembers me.

145
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,079
If you don't know why, think harder.

146
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,600
Let me think.

147
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,399
Let me think.

148
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,439
Could it be...

149
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,160
- Could it be...
- What?

150
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
What could it be? Speak up.

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,199
Out with it.

152
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
I suspect the maid Xiaoju

153
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,920
saw my virginity mark.

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,680
Virginity mark?

155
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,000
So that thing actually exists?

156
00:07:06,368 --> 00:07:08,960
(Regent's Manor)

157
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,959
Your Grace,

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,199
news from the palace

159
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
says His Majesty summoned
Noble Lady Zhu today.

160
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,319
It seems the rumors we spread earlier

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
have reached His Majesty's ears.

162
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
(Maid Xiaoju)
As Your Grace thought,

163
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,456
it's indeed fishy.

164
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,120
Noble Lady Zhu is still a virgin.

165
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,264
Spread this news quickly.

166
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,040
The current First Prince
is a child of unknown origin.

167
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,776
Ensure His Majesty

168
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,839
hears this soon.

169
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,759
Yes, I'm on it.

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,839
Y-Your Majesty,

171
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,959
l-let me assist you in changing.

172
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,240
No hurry.

173
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,879
The night is precious.

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,759
You should first drink this cup

175
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,720
above all.

176
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,279
Yes, Your Majesty.

177
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,840
(Yixiang Palace)

178
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,696
Nurse Liu.

179
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
- Your Majesty.
- What time is it now?

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,639
Your Majesty,

181
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,560
it's three quarters past the Hour of Xu.

182
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,064
It's so late.

183
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,048
Then Cuizhu must be serving

184
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,256
His Majesty?

185
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,600
Your Majesty,

186
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,960
in my opinion,

187
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
you needn't worry.

188
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,759
Cuizhu is a virgin.

189
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
Even if His Majesty finds out,

190
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,960
he won't publicize it.

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,720
No, that's not the point.

192
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,888
If His Majesty discovers Cuizhu is...

193
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,039
That matter isn't important.

194
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,320
What matters

195
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,799
is Xiao Hu's origins.

196
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,679
No.

197
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,399
We must prepare countermeasures.

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,848
Bedtime.

199
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,080
Your Majesty.

200
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,480
Zhu,

201
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,799
what is this?

202
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,240
I concealed my menstrual cycle,

203
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
offending Your Majesty. I beg for mercy.

204
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Audacious!

205
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,679
Do you take me for a fool?

206
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,080
How dare you deceive me!

207
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,759
This is clearly virginal blood!

208
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,039
It's menstrual blood, Your Majesty.

209
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,240
It's menstrual blood.

210
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,759
I beg Your Majesty to see clearly.

211
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,159
Your Grace,

212
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
news from the palace

213
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
says His Majesty raged at Jinxiu Palace.

214
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,480
He truly raged at Jinxiu Palace?

215
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,120
Absolutely confirmed.

216
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,200
Xiaoju says even guards were summoned.

217
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,639
He An,

218
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,679
like I said long ago,

219
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,679
you and the Empress Dowager

220
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,279
couldn't protect that child.

221
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,759
The moonlight tonight is lovely.

222
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,960
Let's visit the Yixiang Palace.

223
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes.

224
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,240
Your Majesty, spare me.

225
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,879
Your Majesty, I truly am experiencing
my monthly cycle.

226
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,000
I feared to offend you.

227
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,264
Your Majesty, show mercy.

228
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,080
See? Being interrogated for an hour,

229
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,799
she keeps repeating the claims.

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
She insists it's her period.

231
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,360
Since you remain so resolute,

232
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,679
perhaps truth will withstand scrutiny.

233
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,440
Physician Zhou and Matron Wang,

234
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,279
come in.

235
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,120
A physician?

236
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,279
Greetings, Your Majesty.

237
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,399
Greetings, Your Majesty.

238
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,200
Rise.

239
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Physician Zhou,

240
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,600
can virginal blood and menstrual blood
be distinguished?

241
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,799
Mr. Cheng,

242
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,616
their origins differ fundamentally.

243
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:52,960
They can be distinguished.

244
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,240
Matron Wang,

245
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,159
can you discern whether a woman

246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,216
has borne children?

247
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:59,808
Having assisted palace consorts
with childbirth for decades,

248
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,399
I can certainly discern such matters.

249
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,559
Then I entrust you both
to verify Noble Lady Zhu's condition

250
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,880
to clear her name.

251
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:07,519
Your Majesty,

252
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm struck by sudden abdominal pain.

253
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,279
Might I relieve myself
before the examination?

254
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
Your Ladyship, this way, please.

255
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
- Your Majesty!
- Your Ladyship.

256
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,120
- Your Majesty!
- Please.

257
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,879
Your Majesty!

258
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,519
- Trust me.
- Let's go.

259
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,919
- Let's go.
- Your Majesty!

260
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,360
- I'm innocent!
- Let's go.

261
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,080
Your Majesty!

262
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:37,312
(Half A Day Earlier)

263
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,120
Noble Lady Zhu is still a virgin?

264
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,336
Who told you this?

265
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,360
Your Majesty,

266
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,039
I just visited the Imperial Kitchen

267
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,560
and overheard maids

268
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
discussing this matter.

269
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,136
Go to Yixiang Palace now

270
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,480
and summon Master Ziru.

271
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:53,279
Yes.

272
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:53,720
Wait.

273
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,584
Investigate

274
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,760
who originated this rumor.

275
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,200
