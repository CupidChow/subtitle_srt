21

No need to worry.

22
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,519
I'm not here to fight you for the child.

23
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:31,879
Then why have you come at this hour?

24
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,048
What couldn't be discussed in court?

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,040
I simply can't comprehend

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,519
why you refuse
to let the child stay with me,

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,760
which is the safest way.

28
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,959
Your Grace, we'll be late for court.

29
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,560
Settle this here.

30
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,088
Or must we take it to court?

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,959
You...

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,239
Regent,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,624
if Xiao Hu remains
His Majesty's only heir,

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,928
he will naturally be the crown prince.

35
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,319
What better future could there be?

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,560
If raised within the palace,

37
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,960
he'll inevitably inherit the throne.

38
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,224
Isn't this exactly what
you have always desired?

39
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,879
Consider carefully.

40
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:31,994
=Episode 12=

41
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:36,224
(Xuanming Palace)

42
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,840
What a coincidence.

43
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,400
The Empress Dowager
and my uncle are both late.

44
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,319
Could there be urgent matters

45
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,439
that escape my knowledge

46
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:58,880
to warrant the delay?

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,968
It's nothing.

48
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,536
Coincidence.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,944
Pure coincidence.

50
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,376
Today I do have a proposal to present,

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,104
one of great urgency.

52
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,480
Speak freely.

53
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,368
A nation needs a ruler.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,744
A ruler needs an heir.

55
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,152
To secure the throne,

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,064
please appoint the First Prince
as Crown Prince

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,848
for our nation's eternal stability.

58
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,216
Appointing the First Prince so hastily?

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,528
What's happening?

60
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:25,639
(I merely used the First Prince
as an excuse.)

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,039
(Yet he takes it seriously.)

62
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,960
Has Your Grace lost sense?

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,232
His Majesty lacks even a principal wife.

64
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:32,680
There's no legitimate heir.

65
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,296
All know 'the child's status
follows the mother's.'

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
To appoint an heir now

67
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,280
would demean any future empress.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,376
Mr. Cheng speaks wisely.

69
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,880
I concur.

70
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,479
The harem needs its mistress.

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,912
The most urgent issue now

72
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,608
is selecting His Majesty's empress.

73
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,552
Your devotion towards me

74
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,400
touches me deeply.

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,328
The empress is the mother of the nation.

76
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,080
It's a matter of state

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,336
and is too weighty.

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,648
Regent,

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,879
you should focus your efforts

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,080
on assisting His Majesty
with military and state affairs.

81
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,296
Harem matters

82
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,120
shall remain my responsibility.

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,520
Her Majesty has managed
harem affairs for years.

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,024
Her willingness

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,200
to share burdens
makes her the ideal candidate.

86
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:20,322
Your Grace

87
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:22,048
has no objections, right?

88
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,680
The Empress Dowager's oversight

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
is the best.

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,399
Enough.

91
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,839
This discussion ends here.

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,728
Recently, Xiyuan barbarians

93
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,079
moved troops presumptuously
against our southern border.

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
What's the current border situation?

95
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,200
Your Majesty,

96
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,888
after successful raids by Xiyuan forces,

97
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,384
they've regrouped elite troops
at the border,

98
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,600
poised for attack.

99
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,639
Marquis Jingyuan
has urgently deployed two fronts

100
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,792
to fortify our defenses.

101
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,648
The general estimates

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,736
that if war starts,

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
it won't conclude quickly.

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,640
Marquis Jingyuan is a state pillar.

105
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:54,336
I'll personally oversee the war

106
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:55,872
to bolster our troops' morale.

107
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,680
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

108
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,040
Yet I have learned

109
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,408
Marquis Jingyuan has an unwed daughter

110
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,752
named Ding Yi,

111
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,896
who's virtuous, talented, and comely.

112
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,904
She's endured warfare
alongside her father.

113
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,400
And she remains
his sole familial attachment.

114
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,488
I propose

115
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,728
we summon her to the capital
and make her

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,688
the empress.

117
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,344
It solves Your Majesty's marriage issue

118
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
and secures Marquis Jingyuan's loyalty,

119
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,408
motivating him to defend our borders

120
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,264
and swiftly quell rebellion.

121
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,664
I'm tired.

122
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,072
Court dismissed.

123
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,824
Court dismissed.

124
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,608
- Respectfully farewell.
- Respectfully farewell.

125
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,720
Regent,

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
such contact in public

127
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:51,399
is improper.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Make He An issue an edict
to appoint Ding Yi

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,328
as Empress.

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,199
- My reminder.
- I...

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,264
The Empress must be ours.

132
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,344
By making Ding Yi empress,

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,920
both the First Prince

134
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,120
and He An himself

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
will remain under our control.

136
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,720
If He An names his supporter Empress,

137
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,360
given time,

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,759
do you think he won't

139
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,160
pursue how the late empress died?

140
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,439
How exactly did the late empress die?

141
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,712
What I say doesn't matter.

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,920
The deceased don't matter either.

143
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,199
Public opinion

144
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
matters most.

145
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,439
You keep avoiding the question.

146
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:32,832
Could it be

147
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,519
that the late empress's death

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,030
is related

149
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:38,759
to you?

150
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,319
You think I killed the late empress?

151
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,008
After she passed,

152
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,704
you rose from concubine to empress.

153
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,319
Who do you think
had the strongest motive?

154
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,984
Your Majesty?

155
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,600
Do you know

156
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,408
how the late empress died?

157
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,079
Why does Your Majesty ask this suddenly?

158
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,720
Have you heard any rumors?

159
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,399
Since they're rumors,

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
why give them credence?

161
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,360
But does His Majesty care?

162
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,880
Rest assured.

163
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,256
I remain

164
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,176
at your service.

165
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,639
Regarding Ding Yi,

166
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,879
what should we do?

167
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,759
Currently,

168
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,120
Ding Yi is indeed the Regent's plant.

169
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,079
But since she's married to His Majesty,

170
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,120
afterwards,

171
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
her loyalty could shift to anyone.

172
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,336
So appointing an empress
only benefits His Majesty.

173
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,519
As for who it is,

174
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,439
that's unimportant.

175
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,560
When faced with two evils,
choose the lesser one.

176
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:02,353
(Xuanming Palace)

177
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,279
It's a full moon tonight,

178
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,439
the perfect time for a family reunion.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,704
I propose we all share a toast.

180
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,319
May our people live
in peace and prosperity.

181
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,759
May peace rule our land.

182
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,136
Well said, Your Majesty.

183
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,279
Well said.

184
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
This rare family banquet gathers us all.

185
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,816
I'll act for His Majesty

186
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,920
and pour wine for everyone present.

187
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,879
Let's toast in celebration.

188
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,639
Regarding the Empress issue,

189
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,749
have

190
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,879
Your Majesties reached a decision?

191
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
Appointing an empress is vital.

192
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,519
Isn't it appropriate to discuss it

193
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,679
at a family banquet?

194
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,799
I find it perfectly appropriate.

195
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,519
Being busy, His Majesty

196
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,279
can't get to know Lady Ding.

197
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,759
It's Mid-Autumn night.

198
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,008
Let's invite her
to join the family banquet.

199
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,799
This will help His Majesty
become familiar with her.

200
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,600
I feel a headache.

201
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,679
Maybe I've drunk too much.

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,736
Fuji.

203
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:13,280
Yes.

204
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,000
Take me back.

205
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,744
Your Majesty.

206
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,279
Your Majesty hasn't answered me yet.

207
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,519
His Majesty is drunk.

208
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,120
Let's seize the chance

209
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,664
and send Lady Ding
to the imperial chambers

210
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:26,639
to serve His Majesty.

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,799
This cannot be allowed.

212
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,879
Everything's permissible.

213
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
It's decided then.

214
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,472
The moon is beautiful.

215
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,648
Let the festivities continue.

216
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,799
Why has Your Majesty come?

217
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,360
I,

218
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,000
master of a nation

219
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,368
and ruler of the land,

220
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,720
actually

221
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,984
find myself homeless.

222
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,680
My incompetence

223
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,312
made Your Majesty suffer.

224
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,264
Yet I believe

225
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,208
Ding Yi isn't as objectionable
as presumed.

226
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,808
What's Your Majesty's

227
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,504
impression of her today?

228
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,584
I couldn't spare a thought.

229
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,408
I feared my look would

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,799
make her clingy.

231
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,584
What kind of empress
does Your Majesty desire?

232
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,679
Anyone will do.

233
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,480
Unless sent by the Regent.

234
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,680
Now that Ding Yi has come,

235
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,344
afterwards,

236
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,759
she could align with our side.

237
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,120
Master, are you suggesting

238
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,559
that I yield to the Regent?

239
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,960
I merely believe

240
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,104
that only by having an empress soon

241
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,960
can Your Majesty grasp governance

242
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,416
and free yourself
from the Regent's shadow.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
Still, the rage consumes me.

244
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:56,559
Forget it.

245
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
I refuse to return today.

246
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,600
I'll sleep here.

247
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:05,919
Then where should I rest?

248
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,512
