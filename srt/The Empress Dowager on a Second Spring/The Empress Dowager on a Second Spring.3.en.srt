=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,319
(Oh.)

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,120
(Is he getting serious?)

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,519
(What?)

24
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:21,879
(What?)

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,120
(What should I do now?)

26
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,200
Your Majesty.
It's getting windy. Don't catch a chill.

27
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,680
Please forgive me.

28
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
Her Majesty is unwell.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,920
I came to deliver clothes.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,920
It's you again.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,159
I thought it was an assassin.

32
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,640
(What?)

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,200
(What's happening?)

34
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,680
(Do these two have bad blood?)

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,079
Captain Yu,

36
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,400
perhaps you should return.

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,040
Your Majesty.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,480
It's a chilly night.
Please prioritize your health.

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,879
(Well done.)

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,879
(Thank goodness you came. Don't leave.)

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,800
Your Grace.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,599
Captain Yu is...

43
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,000
Your servant is quite loyal.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
You just recovered from illness.

45
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,520
Best return early to rest.

46
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
His Grace...

47
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,400
Hard to say.

48
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,520
I need another plan.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,648
=Episode 3=

50
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,759
Your Majesty.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,639
Did you discover anything
from the regent yesterday?

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,360
Is he the child's father?

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,039
Don't get me started.

54
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,039
Yesterday...

55
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,648
But...

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,600
Captain Yu

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
arrived at the perfect moment.

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,960
How did he know you and His Grace

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,280
were there?

60
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,360
It shows Captain Yu truly cares for you.

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,576
I told you the child is his!

62
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:09,840
Don't argue with me.

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
That's not true!

64
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,759
The regent is the one
truly devoted to Her Majesty.

65
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,039
- Captain!
- Regent!

66
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,120
- Captain!
- Regent!

67
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,759
- Captain!
- Regent!

68
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,879
Enough!

69
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,240
Look at the child's features.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,840
Who does he resemble?

71
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,639
These narrow, elongated eyes.

72
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,960
The subtle double eyelids.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,879
He's the guard captain's spitting image!

74
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,879
Nonsense!

75
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,520
Look at his mouth.

76
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,919
The shape of his mouth

77
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,759
and nose.

78
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,400
This is clearly the regent's son!

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Guard captain.

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,960
Regent.

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,560
- Captain!
- Regent!

82
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
- Enough!
- Captain!

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,560
You two are just talking in circles.

84
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,400
Why do I think

85
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:53,319
he resembles Cheng Ziru?

86
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,319
Your Majesty.

87
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
Mr. Cheng is always
in the library at this hour.

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,879
Touch up.

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,400
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

90
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
Once Mr. Cheng enters the library,

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
he won't emerge for hours.

92
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,719
A full touch-up!

93
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,520
Go.

94
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Bring out my finest clothes.

95
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:12,599
Yes.

96
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,479
Your Majesty, watch your step.

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
These are all antiques.

98
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,992
What a coincidence. You're here...

99
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:54,879
reading too?

100
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,399
The book is upside down.

101
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,720
It seems

102
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,480
you already know why I'm here.

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,160
I just didn't expect

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,759
you'd reuse these old tricks.

105
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,040
(Used...)

106
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,319
(before?)

107
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,839
You forgot what you promised me?

108
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,000
You can't keep doing this repeatedly.

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,680
Why are there
so many closed-book exams here?

110
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,839
I haven't figured out

111
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,879
the one on Captain Yu.

112
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,800
Now, another one arises?

113
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,560
What did I promise you?

114
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,959
Repeating the same...

115
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,949
Why not

116
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,959
elaborate on that?

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,439
I...

118
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
I...

119
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,399
Unreasonable.

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,120
What exactly happened between us

121
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,360
that makes you avoid me like the plague?

122
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,120
Explain or stay here.

123
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,399
Guards!

124
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,480
- I...
- Your Majesty.

125
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,496
Your Majesty.

126
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:07,759
Oh my.

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,240
Oh my.

128
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh my goodness.

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,040
So quick.

130
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,680
You two are really something.

131
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,639
I only forgot to tell you,

132
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
no matter what happened,
you must not enter.

133
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,279
And what did you do?

134
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,199
Take it easy.

135
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,272
Next time, we'll try again to catch him.

136
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,360
Next time?

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
When will I ever get
such a perfect chance again?

138
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm back!

139
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,040
Xiao Hu.

140
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
You've returned.

141
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,639
May I ask you

142
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:58,439
where this child came from?

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,959
He's adorable.

144
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,839
It's just past noon.

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Why aren't you resting in your palace?

146
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,639
What brings you here?

147
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,480
It is

148
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,560
my concern about your health

149
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:13,800
that made me discover

150
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,519
this lively scene in your palace.

151
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,560
Xiao Hu

152
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
must be the cat

153
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,279
brought here days ago to hunt rats

154
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,439
and guard the palace, right?

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,439
Yes.

156
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,288
Xiao Hu is naughty.

157
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,680
He ran off somewhere.

158
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,240
Xiao Hu.

159
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Could it be

160
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,639
that he leaped into my arms

161
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,679
and transformed into a crown prince?

162
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,080
What a joke.

163
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,480
Earlier, I heard from your wet nurse

164
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,000
this child was brought recently

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,080
to cheer you up.

166
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,559
Yes.

167
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,559
Days ago, the wet nurse's only daughter
gave birth to this boy.

168
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,519
She brought him here
to request a name from me.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,080
When I saw him,

170
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,919
I was reminded of your childhood.

171
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,080
I grew quite fond of him.

172
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,600
I didn't expect you
to discover him today.

173
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,879
It will be tremendous fortune

174
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,480
for him to gain your favor.

175
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,559
Wet nurse.

176
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,200
When was this child
brought into the palace?

177
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,360
Your Majesty,

178
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,200
I brought him in yesterday evening.

179
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,440
(Not too bad.)

180
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,039
(I have Plan B.)

181
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,360
Fuji,

182
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,159
repeat what you just told me.

183
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,440
Yes.

184
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,519
I went to the imperial guards

185
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,399
and checked the harem entry logs.

186
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,320
In the past year,

187
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,000
there's no record
of the wet nurse's family entering.

188
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,399
How dare you!

189
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,120
You deceived me!

190
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,039
Guards!

191
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,240
Seize her!

192
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,639
Throw her in the prison.

193
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,559
Your Majesty, show mercy!

194
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,120
Spare me!

195
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Your Majesty, show mercy!

196
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,879
- Spare me!
- Wait.

197
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,440
In that case,

198
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,440
I'll speak the truth.

199
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,000
Your Majesty, don't!

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
I want to hear

201
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
how you'll explain this.

202
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,360
This child...

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
The child is actually...

204
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,039
He is actually...

205
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:12,559
your own flesh and blood.

206
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't make baseless claims.

207
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,399
The royal lineage
is meticulously documented.

208
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,679
If he were my child,

209
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,279
how could I not know

210
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,080
who his mother was?

211
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,159
Do you remember

212
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,679
that night,

213
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,639
you came to my chambers?

214
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,840
You got drunk,

215
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,200
so I had...

216
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,080
(Sorry.)

217
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,799
Cuizhu to attend to you.

218
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:43,919
That night,

219
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,639
you took Cuizhu to bed.

220
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,960
Not long after,

221
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,080
she became pregnant.

222
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,399
This should have been a joyous thing.

223
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:54,919
But...

224
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,120
you have not yet married.

225
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,960
With no one in your harem
to manage affairs,

226
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,320
I then thought

227
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,159
to temporarily withhold this matter.

228
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,080
After you get married,

229
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,320
I'd inform you

230
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,240
and entrust the child to you.

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,080
Parental love knows no bounds.

232
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
You only know

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,879
I've been unwell lately,

234
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,399
but you don't know

235
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,679
about my exhaustion
from tending to this grandchild.

236
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,639
I...

237
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,200
I...

238
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,600
How could I...?

239
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,919
During the past months,

240
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,799
I visited you daily,

241
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,879
and Cuizhu attended you constantly.

242
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,200
No signs of her pregnancy.

243
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
My son,

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
with her figure,

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,279
even a pregnancy couldn't show.

246
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,600
But this is too bizarre.

247
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,639
No evidence.

248
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,519
How can I believe?

249
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:56,200
Your Majesty,

250
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,048
Her Majesty is right.

251
00:11:58,528 --> 00:11:59,872
Yixiang Palace's Court Diaries

252
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:01,519
have documented all daily activities.

253
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,799
Your Majesty will see
upon reviewing them.

254
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,240
(No.)

255
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,159
(I was just saying that offhand.)
