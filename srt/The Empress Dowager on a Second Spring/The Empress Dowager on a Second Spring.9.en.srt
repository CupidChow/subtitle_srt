=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:19,959
So sleepy.

22
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,280
Getting up at 5
and attending the court at 6.

23
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm the Empress Dowager,

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,120
but I still work like a corporate drone.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
You're crying.

26
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,480
I've been agonizing
over the First Prince's lineage.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
I can't sleep at night.

28
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,560
I can't help feeling sad.

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
Why bother with others' opinions?

30
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,960
I care not for others' thoughts.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,960
But yours...

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,792
I'd like to hear.

33
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,360
Today's court session will be turbulent.

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
Take extra care of yourself.

35
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,680
Worrying about me?

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,840
Don't worry.

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,800
Even if just for the prince's sake,

38
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,919
I won't lose focus.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,039
The prince...

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,520
Never mind.

41
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,560
Let's go.

42
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,879
No, you...

43
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
What's with speaking

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,599
half a sentence?

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,919
Awake now.

46
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:25,120
=Episode 9=

47
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,280
(Xuanming Palace)

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,840
Though we've not decided to make

49
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,080
a public proclamation
about the First Prince,

50
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,199
there's no doubt about his lineage,

51
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,960
right?

52
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:37,879
I think

53
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,439
the prince's upbringing

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,159
is more pressing than that.

55
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
What do you imply, Your Grace?

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
As the Emperor's sole heir,

57
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
he currently lacks

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,439
proper guardians of royal standing.

59
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
If this became known,

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,400
it'd tarnish the royal name.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,400
The task of educating
a prince is important and cannot be

62
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,680
entrusted carelessly.

63
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,400
Uncle, what do you propose?

64
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,800
We need someone of pure royal blood

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
with substantial authority

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,919
to take this role.

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,639
By Your Grace's wise judgment,

68
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,879
who could shoulder this responsibility?

69
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,759
I am the most suitable candidate.

70
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,800
As His Majesty's uncle,

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,759
I share the royal bloodline

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
and assist His Majesty
with state affairs.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,160
Education is part of my duties.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,240
Entrusting the prince to my care

75
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,279
should raise no objections.

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,279
This is improper.

77
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,319
How so?

78
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,839
As you said, Your Grace,

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,279
you're already occupied
with state affairs.

80
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,959
Court matters are complex enough.

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
Adding royal tutelage to your burdens

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,959
would be inconsiderate.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
(It looks like)

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
(he believes it.)

85
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,160
(This argument won't end soon.)

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,399
(Good thing I prepared.)

87
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,120
Mr. Cheng, who do you suggest?

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
Since Her Majesty
currently cares for the prince,

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,079
why not seek Her Majesty's counsel?

90
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,920
Agreed.

91
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,720
Let Her Majesty decide.

92
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,399
- Let Her Majesty do it.
- Let Her Majesty do it.

93
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:11,800
I...

94
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,519
I...

95
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,959
Go get a physician! Now!

96
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,488
I...

97
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:18,680
I...

98
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,879
I...

99
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:28,736
Water?

100
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:29,568
Go get a physician!

101
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:31,240
- Get a physician!
- Water! Bring water!

102
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,240
Go get a physician!

103
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,120
Hurry!

104
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,120
Your Majesty.

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,959
Your Majesty, this is bad.

106
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,759
Captain Yu has taken Xiao Hu away.

107
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,560
What?

108
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,910
Captain Yu learned

109
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,639
the Regent's intention to take him away,

110
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,399
so he...

111
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,439
This is madness.

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,639
What did he say?

113
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,839
He vowed to protect
the prince with his life.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,959
He will take him to safety.

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,279
He wants to reassure you.

116
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,000
Your Majesty, slow down.

117
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,319
Stay calm, Your Majesty.

118
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,120
How can I stay calm?

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,399
With Captain Yu by his side,

120
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,800
Xiao Hu must be safe.

121
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,360
Yes.

122
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,879
I know he'd never harm the child.

123
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,439
But...

124
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,279
A big tough guy with a little kid.

125
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,079
I told him not to take the baby out.

126
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,079
Complete chaos.

127
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,399
Is Her Majesty awake?

128
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,312
Your Majesty.

129
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,279
You woke up so early.

130
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,560
You need rest.

131
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,399
Do you need anything?

132
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Nothing.

133
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,000
His Majesty sent me to check

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,399
on your health.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm fine.

136
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,600
Thank His Majesty for his concern.

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,720
Good.

138
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,759
Since you're unwell,

139
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,240
let me take charge of the First Prince.

140
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,279
The prince...

141
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,720
H-H-He isn't here.

142
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,199
You may attend to your duties.

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,519
He's not here?

144
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,160
Where is he?

145
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,759
Where is he?

146
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,399
Has anything happened?

147
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,040
Guards!

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,399
Fine.

149
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,560
Listen.

150
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:32,839
Yu Feng feared the Regent
would take the baby,

151
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,240
so he smuggled Xiao Hu
out of the palace.

152
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,399
What?

153
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,519
What...

154
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,759
What are you doing?

155
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,639
What else would I do?

156
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,279
Find the child!

157
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:42,680
No!

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,319
If this gets out,

159
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,439
Yu Feng will die.

160
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,519
How can you protect
him at a time like this?

161
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,360
It's not...

162
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,920
He genuinely acted
to protect the First Prince.

163
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,720
Fine.

164
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,040
I promise to keep this secret.

165
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I'll search alone.

166
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
What's your plan?

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,480
I have my ways.

168
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,720
I'll go with you.

169
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
We're leaving the palace?

170
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,639
I took two days off

171
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,839
from His Majesty.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
And you?

173
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
Everything's arranged.

174
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,279
Xiao Hu needs isolation due to shock,

175
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,840
and I require rest after fainting.

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,360
No visitors permitted.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,799
Good.

178
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:43,919
But

179
00:08:44,672 --> 00:08:47,200
can we find Xiao Hu in two days?

180
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,039
Plenty of time.

181
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,048
During this morning's court session,

182
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,552
how did you know I was

183
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,200
choking?

184
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,256
You had date cake crumbs by your feet.

185
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,960
Quick!

186
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,559
Back in the Imperial Library,

187
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
you choked once before.

188
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,159
The Imperial Library?

189
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,639
(I knew it.)

190
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,399
(I need to figure out)

191
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,960
(what exactly happened)

192
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,919
(in the library.)

193
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,088
Your Majesty,

194
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
is Xiao Hu

195
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,879
your biological child?

196
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,440
Is Xiao Hu

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,704
the Regent's son?

198
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,399
(Has her affair with the Regent)

199
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,480
(become common knowledge?)

200
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:16,896
I...

201
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,639
I don't want to hear it!

202
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,120
I said nothing!

203
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,840
You...

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,159
Am I truly so vulgar?

205
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:25,240
Then

206
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
why accompany me to find Xiao Hu?

207
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,799
What?

208
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,480
What? Didn't you say

209
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,679
you didn't want to hear?

210
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,240
You know something, don't you?

211
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,080
Yes.

212
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,600
His Majesty told me.

213
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,919
The First Prince is the Regent's child?

214
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Why would you say that?

215
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
The Empress Dowager...

216
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,519
She...

217
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,840
You dismissed everyone.

218
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,240
For what purpose?

219
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
You may not be aware.

220
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,000
Since our parting at my manor,

221
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,799
I've lost sleep nightly.

222
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,200
Once I close my eyes,

223
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,240
I see your beautiful face.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Show some restraint.

225
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,600
Why are you so cold towards me?

226
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,279
What a beautiful night this is.

227
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,816
Perfect for rekindling old flames.

228
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,879
She and my uncle...

229
00:11:57,536 --> 00:12:00,000
His Majesty was dead drunk that day.

230
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,944
He ran to your palace and wept bitterly.

231
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:05,984
Do you remember, Your Majesty?

232
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,960
So this was the reason

233
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,759
for His Majesty's drunkenness.
