21

Still awake?

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,719
You're here.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,760
The First Prince is sleeping soundly.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Class dismissed.

25
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,680
Where's His Majesty?

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
Did His Majesty not leave?

27
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,319
So he's hiding.

28
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:00,319
It's because the Regent

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,280
sent Ding Yi into the palace.

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,560
So

31
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,360
are you now homeless?

32
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,984
I'm a lone soul.

33
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:14,879
What are you doing?

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,439
Why won't you let me drink?

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Why must you drink?

36
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:24,919
Do you know...

37
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:28,120
Do you know how hard this is for me?

38
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,000
I...

39
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,039
I'm alone.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,199
With no family to rely on,

41
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,719
I'm utterly solitary.

42
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,960
And I'm a widow.

43
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,599
It's fine.

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
Being a widow doesn't matter.

45
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,439
But I have a child.

46
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:49,080
And I must protect him.

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,919
On one hand,
I must guard against the Regent.

48
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,159
On the other hand,

49
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,680
what infuriates me most

50
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:01,879
is having to style this hair every day.

51
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:03,840
It hurts terribly.

52
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,639
Do you understand?

53
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,280
I do.

54
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,560
No, you don't.

55
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:15,840
If you truly understood,

56
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:17,039
you'd let me drink.

57
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:18,919
Why insist on drinking?

58
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:20,240
Okay, I'll skip the drink.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,599
Then

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,879
answer me one question.

61
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:26,840
Why

62
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:29,719
do you avoid alcohol?

63
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,360
You know full well why.

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
I don't know.

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,319
I truly don't.

66
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,680
I came here knowing nothing.

67
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,840
Have you forgotten?

68
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,599
Yes.

69
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,759
I forgot.

70
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,280
I forgot everything.

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
Now I'll ask just one thing.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In your heart,

73
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,112
is there a place for me?

74
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,199
What if there is?

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,039
What if there isn't?

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,960
Does it matter?

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,759
It does.

78
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,280
It matters greatly.

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,639
It matters more than anything.

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
Why force me to drink?

81
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,656
I quit drinking to avoid seeing you.

82
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:11,800
I endured such agony.

83
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,120
Can't you understand?

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,879
You think I don't want
to hold or look at you?

85
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,480
Since that night in the library,

86
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
I've thought of you every day.

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
The library?

88
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,439
We...

Your Majesty.

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,720
Come on.

92
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,279
Drink with me.

93
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,720
Drink.

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,879
You are drunk.

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,319
I'll take you back.

96
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,399
I'm not drunk.

97
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,639
Zhao Chengtian is a beast.

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,279
- Beast.
- Your Majesty.

99
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,680
Mind your words.

100
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,040
Mind my words?

101
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,720
Why should I mind my words?

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,879
I measure every word daily.

103
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,048
I'm telling you,

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
sooner or later,

105
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll overthrow Zhao Chengtian

106
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,240
and restore clarity to our nation.

107
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,839
Tell me truthfully.

108
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,120
Did you ever have feelings for me?

109
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Hypocrite.

110
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
You all bully me.

111
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,079
Why do you all bully me?

112
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,040
Why does everyone bully me?

113
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,600
The whole world bullies me.

114
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,639
Zhao Chengtian bullies me.

115
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,720
After that night,

116
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,120
you have occupied my thoughts

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,600
and never left.

119
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,120
I tell you

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,480
that the current me is me,

121
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:13,376
yet not entirely me...

122
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:14,159

remains unstable.

That's why since that night,

135
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,200
I've abstained from wine

136
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,679

would bring me to you.
