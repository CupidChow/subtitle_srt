=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,480
Then

22
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:16,040
why did you join the palace guards?

23
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:17,920
I worried they'd bully you.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,519
See? I'm perfectly fine.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,319
I know you like Cheng Ziru.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,159
He's loyal to the Emperor.

27
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,959
He'll never side with us.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
He might harm you.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,000
Yu Feng,

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,280
t-take a look at my neck.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,680
Does it need medicine?

32
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,040
If we don't treat it soon,

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,239
it'll scab over.

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,000
=Episode 11=

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,879
Well?

36
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,640
Did you take care of that boy?

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,280
Your Majesty,

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,319
I can't kill the First Prince.

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,599
Please punish me.

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,960
Please rise.

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,039
Have you encountered difficulties?

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,319
Indeed.

43
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,800
Yu Feng is a great fighter.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,879
It's reasonable you couldn't defeat him.

45
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:20,039
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,719
there is no proof that
the First Prince is the Regent's son.

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,159
I cannot kill him.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,199
Are you insane?

49
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,759
The Empress Dowager
is involved with the Regent.

50
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,159
That boy is from her palace.

51
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,960
He's surely the Regent's son.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,816
Your Majesty.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,400
I still find this matter suspicious.

54
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,199
If the First Prince
were truly the Regent's son,

55
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,120
why would Her Majesty call him yours?

56
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,599
If you had no heir,

57
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,680
wouldn't that benefit the Regent more?

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,400
Who knows what those two

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
are secretly plotting?

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,919
It might be their new scheme.

61
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,199
If one day

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,199
they force me to grant the boy a title,

63
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,544
should I swallow it silently?

64
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,400
I'd rather be crushed to pieces

65
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:00,479
than let Your Majesty suffer that.

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,039
Please grant me some time.

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,439
I will uncover the truth.

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,000
And what if you fail?

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,439
Then I'll

70
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,400
atone by suicide.

71
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,039
Since you insist so firmly,

72
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,439
let it be so.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,080
Thank you.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,840
Master,

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,159
are you withholding something from me

76
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,639
about the Empress Dowager?

77
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:32,639
I know nothing.

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,599
Please rise.

79
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:46,944
Thank you.

80
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,599
His Grace requests an audience.

81
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,960
Welcome, Your Grace.

82
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,520
Her Majesty is unwell.

83
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,639
She can't see you.

84
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,719
Please return.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,280
Please, Your Grace.

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,639
Her Majesty is truly unwell.

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,639
Whenever I visited Yixiang Palace,

88
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,759
you always used this excuse.

89
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,520
Yet you dared not actually stop me.

90
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,439
Has something happened

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,008
to her?

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,839
If not her,

93
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,759
then the First Prince?

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,879
I must enter today.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,279
Please, Your Grace.

96
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,360
- Please.
- Move.

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,680
You want to die?

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,759
This is trespassing.

99
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,439
Your Grace is audacious.

100
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,959
It's you again.

101
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,399
Get out of my way.

102
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,959
I need not explain myself to you.

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,639
Her Majesty is unwell.

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,519
Your Grace must leave.

105
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Do you truly think I won't kill you?

106
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,480
Your Grace fears nothing under heaven.

107
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,920
But to storm this palace,

108
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,800
you'll have to step over my corpse.

109
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
If you're so eager to die nobly,

110
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,120
I'll oblige you today.

111
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,600
Let me see who dares act.

112
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,279
Are you here to visit me

113
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,439
or to commit murder?

114
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,199
Hearing of your illness,

115
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,439
I was deeply concerned.

116
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,639
You've missed court for two days.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
And no news of the First Prince.

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,480
So after court,

119
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,879
I rushed here to see you.

120
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:27,839
Alright.

121
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,639
It's my fault.

122
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
Don't be angry.

123
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,079
Take me to see the First Prince.

124
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,399
So I can be at ease.

125
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
The First Prince is fine.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,160
If you have something,

127
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,439
you may speak it here.

128
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,279
I still have misgivings.

129
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,800
I'll take the First Prince home.

130
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,439
No.

131
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,639
Why not?

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,759
- You...
- What?

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,879
Do you doubt Her Majesty's

134
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,839
ability to care for the First Prince?

135
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,128
I'm talking with her.

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
Why do you interrupt?

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,759
Regent,

138
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,199
are you now suggesting

139
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
that I'm incapable
of protecting even a child?

140
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,000
Fine.

141
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
I won't take him away.

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,279
Why must you do this?

143
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm fine.

144
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,279
Silly you.

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,199
Don't fear.

146
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,199
Your Majesty, your neck is injured.

147
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,519
Let me summon a physician.

148
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm fine. It's scabbed over.

149
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,879
Scabbed over so quickly?

150
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Yu Feng, I've kept my word.

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,839
It's getting late.

152
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,879
Can Xiao Hu be taken to rest now?

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,319
Your Majesty.

154
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,360
Your Majesty,

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,319
your return today was perfectly timed.

156
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,879
Master Ziru was on the verge
of breaking earlier.

157
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,560
But Master Ziru's courage is remarkable.

158
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,399
He even dared tell the Regent

159
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,680
to 'step over his corpse.'

160
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,120
He was so bold.

161
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,759
Cheng Ziru.

162
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,079
Have you lost your mind?

163
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,759
Defying the Regent to his face?

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
He's not Yu Feng.

165
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,759
His sword

166
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,040
could truly kill you.

167
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
Haven't you gone mad too?

168
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,399
Defending me?

169
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,128
If it cut deeper...

170
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:04,352
I...

171
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,160
Tell me.

172
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,160
Even if

173
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,439
Xiao Hu were the Regent's son,

174
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,959
would you still die for him?

175
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,800
I don't care.

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,920
I only know he's your son.

177
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,279
You protect him,

178
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,839
so I must protect him.

179
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
You fool.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,919
(Is Xiao Hu)

181
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,080
(my...)

182
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,039
You...

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,399
It's cold.

184
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,639
Don't get chill.

185
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,679
What I'm curious about

186
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,320
is how you persuaded Yu Feng to return.

187
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,480
(I won't bring)

188
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Xiao Hu back to the palace.

189
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,480
Really?

190
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,799
Of course.

191
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,960
Depart immediately.

192
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,320
Go as far as you can.

193
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,639
The capital isn't safe.

194
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,240
And Your Majesty?

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,039
With our numbers,

196
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,679
we could never
escape the Regent's reach.

197
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,679
I must stay to cover for you.

198
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,799
I'll say

199
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
the First Prince died

200
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,279
and you killed yourself.

201
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,080
However,

202
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
from now on,

203
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,080
you two shall cease to exist.

204
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:08,679
Perhaps you can survive this way.

205
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,440
Do you think

206
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,000
the Regent would spare you?

207
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,879
That's not your concern.

208
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,312
From now on,

209
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:18,944
Xiao Hu must follow you

210
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:20,240
and live a vagrant life.

211
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,679
I have but one wish.

212
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,080
Keep him safe.

213
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,480
Your Majesty.

214
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,039
Leave quickly and no more words.

215
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,464
Your Majesty,

216
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,840
let's go.

217
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,799
I said I can't leave.

218
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,360
To the palace.

219
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:48,672
Promise me

220
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,040
you won't take such risks again.

221
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,399
You also have to promise me

222
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
you won't risk again.

223
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,559
Does it hurt?

224
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,320
