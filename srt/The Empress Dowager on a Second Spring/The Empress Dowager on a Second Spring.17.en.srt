=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,640
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,920
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,719
Your Majesty. Bad news. Bad news.

24
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:17,560
Your Majesty.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,400
What's wrong?

26
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,719
The eunuch sent to investigate
has returned.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
He said Rong never went
to her brother's place.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
Her brother also said

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,480
they haven't heard
from her for a few years.

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,719
She didn't go home?

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,319
So did she leave the palace or not?

32
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,120
I checked the palace gate registry.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,239
There's no record of Rong leaving.

34
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,560
What should we do?

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,200
She's human.

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
We must find her alive or dead.

37
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,319
Slow down.

38
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,680
Your wounds just started healing.

39
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:41,879
Tell me,

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,239
where did Rong live before?

41
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,879
She stayed in a private chamber

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,480
at Yixiang Palace.

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,879
After she left the palace,

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,599
was her room reassigned?

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,319
No.

46
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,159
- Not yet.
- Good.

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,439
Take me to Rong's room.

48
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:58,506
=Episode 17=

49
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,439
This was Rong's room?

50
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:14,879
Your Majesty, what should we do now?

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,639
Listen.

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Search every inch

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,599
of this room,

55
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,560
inside and out.

56
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:21,792
Focus on

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
items that don't belong here.

58
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,439
Understood.

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,639
It's Rong's favorite zither.

60
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,408
Rong plays the zither?

61
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,520
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,280
It's Rong's handkerchief.

63
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,479
How can you tell?

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
Our maids' belongings
often get mixed up.

65
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,759
To avoid confusion,

66
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,759
we embroider personal symbols.

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
This peach blossom petal is Rong's mark.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,039
Your Majesty,

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,360
It's an imperial robe.

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,240
Why would Rong have an imperial robe?

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,120
Was she involved with His Majesty?

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,159
Imperial robe?

73
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,159
Could Rong have been carrying...?

74
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,080
If

75
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,199
the Empress Dowager never bore children,

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,960
then the First Prince
is very likely Rong's son.

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,439
Where did Rong go after giving birth?

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If she was killed,

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,479
was it the Regent's doing?

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,240
But

81
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,800
why would Yu Feng

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,080
hide the First Prince's true mother?

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,680
Was it just to have him recognized

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,159
as the Empress Dowager's son?

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,879
Or perhaps

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,639
the previous Empress Dowager
ordered this?

87
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,160
Where's Yu Feng now?

88
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,680
He just left the palace.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
He left?

90
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,120
Where to?

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,959
The gate eunuch said

92
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,040
he headed toward the mass graves.

93
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,279
(Court Diaries)
The 7th day of the 10th lunar month, 3rd Year, Ansheng,

94
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,040
Rong left the palace for treatment.

95
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,240
What's today's date?

96
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,920
The 7th day.

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,800
Exactly one year since that entry.

98
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,400
If Rong didn't leave for treatment

99
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,759
but actually died,

100
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,160
then today

101
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,224
is her death anniversary.

102
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,199
Get a carriage. To Yu Feng.

103
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,240
Your Majesty, you forget.

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,800
His Majesty has confined you.

105
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,519
You can't leave Yixiang Palace now.

106
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,519
Biyu,

107
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,360
fetch your clothes.

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,040
Rong,

109
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:40,959
do you see?

110
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,639
Her Majesty came for you.

111
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,720
Rong,

112
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,279
today marks one year since your passing.

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,399
I came to tell you

114
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
your son is named Xiaohu.

115
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,399
He's adorable and thriving.

116
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,839
Now

117
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,879
he's officially
His Majesty's First Prince.

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Rest in peace.

119
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,120
Yu Feng,

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,639
there's something

121
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,000
I wish to tell you.

122
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
Please speak.

123
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,040
I've decided
to accept the Regent's terms

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,199
and marry him.

125
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,160
To save Cheng Ziru,

126
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,480
you'd go this far to sacrifice yourself?

127
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,920
Not just for Ziru.

128
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
It's also for Rong.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,639
Haven't you been asking

130
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,680
why I've been acting
so strangely lately?

131
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,600
The truth is

132
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,120
I've forgotten many past events.

133
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,879
But fragments occasionally surface.

134
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,352
Recently

135
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,336
I remembered Rong.

136
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,040
That's why

137
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,800
I want you to tell me
in front of Rong's grave.

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,992
How exactly

139
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:51,360
did she die?

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,759
(Maid Rong)
You're sure this child is His Majesty's?

141
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,120
That day His Majesty
stayed drunk at Yixiang Palace.

142
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,959
I was ordered to attend him closely.

143
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,344
I never expected

144
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,480
that His Majesty...

145
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,439
Come here.

146
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,519
This matter must be kept a secret.

147
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,720
Especially from the Regent.

148
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,920
Otherwise,

149
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,600
not just the child,

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,519
but Rong would be in danger too.

151
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,839
What should we do?

152
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,488
When the time comes,

153
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:29,120
summon a midwife

154
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,120
from outside the palace
to deliver the child

155
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,040
and provide money

156
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,199
to send her far away.

157
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,879
After Rong gives birth,

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
secretly send her from the palace.

159
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,224
Push harder.

160
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,304
Hold on.

161
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,040
Push harder.

162
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:44,839
Feng.

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:45,879
Yes?

164
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,560
No matter what happens tonight,

165
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,480
allow no one near.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,304
Yes.

167
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,000
Push.

168
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,879
Push.

169
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,040
Your Majesty.

170
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:56,959
Well?

171
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,040
Please calm yourself.

172
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,720
The child is safe,

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,879
but due to

174
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,959
prolonged delivery,

175
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,439
Her Ladyship

176
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
didn't make it.

177
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,639
Rong died in childbirth,

178
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,519
meaning

179
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,639
today is actually Xiao Hu's

180
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,639
first birthday?

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,399
Yes.

182
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,399
You had me alter his birth date

183
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
in the court diaries

184
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,800
in case people notice it.

185
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
Everything makes sense.

186
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,759
Tomorrow,

187
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,480
if I can't prove to the Regent

188
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,959
that Xiao Hu is his son,

189
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,799
both Ziru and Xiao Hu
will be in grave danger.

190
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Then I'll ensure
he doesn't live to tomorrow.

191
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,960
You can't get close to him.

192
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,519
But

193
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,399
before knowing Xiao Hu's true parentage,

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,679
I was constrained.

195
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,799
Now

196
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,000
it'll be easy to convince him.

197
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,480
Tomorrow,

198
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
we'll go to the Regent's Manor

199
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,919
for a paternity test.

200
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,960
Your dress?

201
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,720
A disguise.

202
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,840
Disguise in my own manor?

203
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,279
- You've been here...
- Stop it.

204
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:05,960
Business first.

205
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,799
Okay.

206
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,559
He is here.

207
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,919
How will you prove it to me?

208
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,480
Please prepare a bowl of water

209
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,120
for a blood paternity test.

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,639
Your Majesty.

211
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,080
Someone.

212
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,080
Do it.

213
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:28,960
Would you

214
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,720
like to inspect the water?

215
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,279
It's merely plain water.

216
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,039
Bring the First Prince here.

217
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,559
Your Majesty, this is unwise.

218
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,639
Yu Feng,

219
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,639
will you stand by and watch

220
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,720
the First Prince be bled?

221
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,159
Bring the First Prince.

222
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,919
Your Majesty.

223
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,960
Heaven hasn't abandoned me.

224
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,559
I have an heir.

225
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,679
In that case,

226
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll take Cheng Ziru away.

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,639
Wait.

228
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,360
Backing out now?

229
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
You may take Cheng Ziru,

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
but leave my son with me.

231
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,399
No.

232
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,039
Yu Feng.

233
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
It's been proven

234
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,519
that the First Prince
is the Regent's son.

235
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,679
The Regent

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,008
would never

237
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,639
harm his own son.

238
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,639
Well said.

239
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
My own son shouldn't

240
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,080
be guarded by some

241
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,639
blade-wielding guard.

242
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,519
Then remove these shackles.

243
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,879
Are you alright?

244
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Let's go.

245
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,639
Wait.

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,559
What about our marriage?

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,759
I'll petition His Majesty for approval
upon returning to the palace.

248
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,720
Nurse Liu stays to care for the boy.

249
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,679
Let me be frank with you.

250
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,080
Xiao Hu isn't the Regent's son.

251
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,919
Stop trying to comfort me.

252
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,399
The blood paternity test doesn't lie.

253
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,120
That blood paternity test

254
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,399
was tampered with.

255
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,720
It was fake.

256
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,240
Just a pinch of alum

257
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,759
can make anyone's blood mix.

258
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,399
It's true.

259
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,840
Let me prove it to you.

260
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:36,759
No.

261
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
However,

262
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,960
though Xiao Hu isn't the Regent's,

263
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,600
he's not yours either.

264
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,919
You... you...

265
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,440
