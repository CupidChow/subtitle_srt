=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,959
Release the Empress Dowager,

22
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,920
and I'll proclaim
the prince as Crown Prince.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,359
You'll be in charge of court affairs.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,280
I'll feign illness and retire.

25
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,519
I'll nurture the prince for you.

26
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,159
Your son will inherit
the legitimate throne.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
This way,

28
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,799
your descendants gain the empire,

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,400
and you'll be remembered
in history as a virtuous prince,

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,760
leaving an illustrious name.

31
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,799
Two birds with one stone.

32
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,159
How unexpected.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
You'd go this far to sacrifice
for the Empress Dowager?

34
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,400
One more condition.

35
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,239
I'll take the prince back.

36
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,760
Don't even think about it.

37
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,519
The Crown Prince shouldn't stay outside.

38
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,359
Uncle, don't forget.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,519
Ding Yi remains in my custody.

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
If anything happens to Ding Yi,

41
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,280
how will you explain it

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,760
to Marquis Jingyuan?

43
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,200
Moreover, Ding Yi serves you.

44
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,719
Having her care for the prince

45
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,400
should ease your concerns.

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,840
He An,

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
you've grown remarkably.

48
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,520
Thank you for the praise.

49
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,224
The Empress Dowager

50
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,664
and the prince...

51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,560
I'll take them back with me.

52
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:36,256
Your demise approaches.

53
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm fine.

54
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:53,105
=Episode 21=

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,639
Your Majesty.

56
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,240
Today's the wedding day.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,360
Do you truly intend to marry the Regent?

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,808
Let's go.

59
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,080
The auspicious hour has arrived.

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,312
(Xuanming Palace)

61
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,960
Commence the wedding ceremony.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,439
The auspicious hour has arrived.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,879
Let the couple perform bows.

64
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,600
First bow to heaven and earth.

65
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,560
Second bow to ancestral spirits.

66
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,480
Finally, bow to each other.

67
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,879
Bow to each other.

68
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,279
What's happening?

69
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,519
Such a joyous wedding.

70
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,839
(Marquis Jingyuan, Ding Yong)
Why not invite me?

71
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,920
Why enter now?

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,240
Where's the boy emperor?

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,519
Today's the Empress Dowager
and my uncle's wedding.

74
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,680
Shouldn't you be defending our borders?

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,160
Why come unsummoned?

76
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,399
I fight desperately at the frontier,

77
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,279
but you scorn my daughter,

78
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,000
denying her the empress title!

79
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,240
Abdicate to the Regent now.

80
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,240
Your Grace.

81
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,360
Did I arrive in time?

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,319
I planned to let He An relinquish

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,199
the throne after the wedding ceremony.

84
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,680
Minor complications arose,

85
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,439
but they matter not.

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,120
He An.

87
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,240
The palace is now surrounded
by elite troops.

88
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,879
Resistance is futile.

89
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,759
Abdicate to me,

90
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,879
and I guarantee
your comfortable retirement.

91
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,480
How dare you stage a rebellion!

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
Our marriage pact

93
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,879
is called off now!

94
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,079
You can't annul it unilaterally!

95
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,519
Soon, the empire will be mine.

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,959
It's not up to you.

97
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,079
Someone.

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
Secure the Empress Dowager.

99
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,720
Who dares?

100
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,720
Expect me to marry you?

101
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,160
In your dreams!

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,839
Demanding my abdication?

103
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,480
That's wishful thinking!

104
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,639
Shall I cling to life

105
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,040
by surrendering the empire?

106
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,439
You reject courtesy for coercion?

107
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,240
Abdicate or face deposition.

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,600
While I live,

109
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,560
none shall harm
His Majesty or Her Majesty!

110
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,519
Yu Feng.

111
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,079
I acknowledge your heroism

112
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,040
and loyalty.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,560
Lay down your arms

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,480
and surrender to me,

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,079
and I'll appoint you as Grand General.

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
Never!

117
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,199
Well then,

118
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,279
I'll show no mercy.

119
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,879
General Ding.

120
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,639
Yes.

121
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,639
Arrest everyone in this hall.

122
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,160
Those who surrender

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,800
shall be promoted.

124
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,176
The resistant ones

125
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:27,879
shall be executed now!

126
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Your Majesty, ascend the throne.

127
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,560
- Ascend the throne.
- Ascend the throne.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,639
Your Majesty,

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,439
won't you join me?

130
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,319
No, this...

131
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,800
General.

132
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,839
What are you doing?

133
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,759
What am I doing?

134
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,720
If you kill my future son-in-law,

135
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,319
my precious daughter
would become a widow.

136
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,624
Moreover, your personal guards
and assassins

137
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,740
have all been killed.

138
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,940
We also found evidence

139
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,920
of your rebellion
and collusion in your manor.

140
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,040
How dare you betray me?

141
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,639
My daughter is about
to become the Empress.

142
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,288
Why would the father
of the future Empress rebel?

143
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,240
Seize him!

144
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
Please forgive me.

145
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,800
I feared information leakage,

146
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,759
which led to this staged performance.

147
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,039
I offended Your Majesty.

148
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:34,559
Rise, General.

149
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,919
Thank you, Your Majesty.

150
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,279
So

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,480
you didn't collude with the Regent?

152
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,879
Well...

153
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Not exactly.

154
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,639
Perhaps we should invite him

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,519
to explain everything to Your Majesty.

156
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,720
Master.

157
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,600
My rescue comes too late.

158
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,879
Please forgive me.

159
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,039
You're alive!

160
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,080
Regarding this matter,

161
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,200
it all began at the one-year-old catch,

162
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,879
with Ziru's arrest

163
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,360
and release.

164
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,200
A letter from the frontier?

165
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,559
Marquis Jingyuan.

166
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,759
Marquis Jingyuan?

167
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,360
How are you connected to him?

168
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,360
He served under my late father,

169
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
who once headed the Ministry of War

170
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,039
and was the late Empress's father.

171
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,639
Your father
was the previous Empress's father?

172
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,879
Then you must be...

173
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,199
The late Empress

174
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:44,256
was my sister.

175
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,480
But your surname...

176
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,600
I was adopted and changed my surname.

177
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,080
I kept it quiet

178
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,559
to better protect
my sister and His Majesty.

179
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
Before she passed, she made me

180
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,639
promise to protect His Majesty

181
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,080
and told me to turn

182
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
to Marquis Jingyuan if needed.

183
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,600
So Marquis Jingyuan's dealings
with the Regent

184
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,279
were actually to protect His Majesty.

185
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,559
No wonder

186
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,240
you trust Ding Yi completely.

187
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,320
So your plan

188
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,360
involved Marquis Jingyuan
from the start.

189
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,120
Correct.

190
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,799
If the Regent takes the bait,

191
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,480
he'll transfer me to the frontier

192
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,679
and order Marquis Jingyuan

193
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,720
to kill me at the border.

194
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,159
Good.

195
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,679
Brilliant plot.

196
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Then let's follow this script

197
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,720
to develop the next acts.

198
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,879
But you died.

199
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,519
I saw your corpse!

200
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,679
The soldiers' words

201
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,159
were staged by the Marquis

202
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,440
and me.

203
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,279
The fire was staged.

204
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,519
The burned remains

205
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
were a straw effigy.

206
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
To convince him

207
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,679
of Ziru's death,

208
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,919
I had to perform

209
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,360
a heartbroken vengeance act.

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,799
You conspired to deceive me!

211
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,519
You came too late.

212
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,639
I nearly

213
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,360
completed the wedding ceremony with him.

214
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,200
Look.

215
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,919
The Regent has decided to rebel.

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,399
So Her Majesty's plan
in the capital succeeds.

217
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,600
The traitor demands
my immediate departure

218
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,919
to capture the Emperor after his wedding

219
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,360
with the Empress Dowager.

220
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,960
To convince me,

221
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,679
he offered a princedom

222
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,240
and a capital territory.

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,120
Quite generous terms.

224
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,879
His wedding with the Empress Dowager?

225
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,879
Is there any trouble in the capital?

226
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,399
No time to waste.

227
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,720
Let's hurry to the capital.

228
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
Since he wants a grand wedding,

229
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,279
we'll turn his plan against him.

230
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,640
Turn the wedding

231
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,000
into a funeral.

232
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,600
Are you doing this for dramatic effect?

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,720
We almost entered
the bridal chamber together.

234
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,320
How could I ever let you marry him?

235
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,120
If I had returned sooner,

236
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,399
wouldn't that have exposed us?

237
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,879
I don't care.

238
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,919
Today, we made vows to heaven and earth.

239
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,039
That makes you mine.

240
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
We even have a child.

241
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
He's the Crown Prince!

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,519
The Crown Prince.

243
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,159
I forgot to tell you.

244
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,232
The blood paternity test was fake.

245
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,429
Xiao Hu

246
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:20,120
is the Emperor's own child.

247
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
I don't believe it.

248
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,440
I don't believe!

249
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,240
Let her go!

250
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:28,600
Nobody move!

251
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,159
If anyone approaches,

252
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,840
I'll take her life with mine!
