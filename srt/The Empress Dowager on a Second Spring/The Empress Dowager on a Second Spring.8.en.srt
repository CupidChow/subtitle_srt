=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,359
Through my examination,

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,656
Noble Lady Zhu showed
maiden's blood last night

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,120
and showed no signs of childbirth.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
I concur with his conclusion.

25
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,648
Please calm your anger.

26
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:27,200
But I'm only speaking the truth.

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,280
Physician Zhou and Matron Wang

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,920
were personally summoned
by Your Majesty.

30
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,000
Since she's not his mother,

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,816
I must ask you

32
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,319
where the prince truly came from

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,719
and if he's truly His Majesty's son.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,640
Guard Captain Yu Feng requests
an urgent audience with His Majesty.

35
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,760
Granted.

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,640
Your Majesties,

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,480
during my patrol last night,

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,632
I saw this man conspiring
with Physician Zhou

39
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,519
and Matron Wang.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,039
Do as I said.

41
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,376
What conspiracy?

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,240
To avoid alerting them,

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,360
I didn't approach them.

44
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,000
But I saw him

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,120
giving silver notes
to Physician Zhou and Matron Wang.

46
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,360
After I apprehended him later,

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,719
he confessed

48
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,599
to bribing Physician Zhou
and Matron Wang

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,080
to falsely testify in court

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,599
that Noble Lady Zhu remained a virgin.

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
I am wronged!

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,159
These silver notes
were found in your homes.

53
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,656
The proof is right here!

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,064
How dare you deny this?

55
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,624
How dare you two?

56
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,159
You taint imperial lineage
with false testimony!

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,080
Guards!

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
Drag them out and behead them!

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,512
Wait!

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,719
Your Majesty.

61
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,960
Even if the two lied about Her Ladyship

62
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,232
being a virgin,

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,759
it doesn't prove she birthed the prince.

64
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,159
Her alleged childbirth

65
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,280
has no official records.

66
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,639
The imperial bloodline's purity

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
cannot be verified by mere words.

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,928
Your Majesty.

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,879
Since the truth
can no longer be concealed,

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,240
let me reveal it to all.

71
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
The prince was actually conceived

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,319
during His Majesty's incognito travel...

73
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,759
I only learned of this a few months ago.

74
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
An imperial heir brings joy,

75
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,240
but...

76
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,159
his mother's lowly status

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,719
made her unfit for palace life.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,840
I arranged for the child
to be brought to the palace

79
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,208
and appointed my maid as his mother.

80
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,512
His Majesty is young

81
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,432
and reckless.

82
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,600
To preserve our pure imperial blood,

83
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,120
I...

84
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,599
had to go with it.

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,759
I never intended this revelation,

86
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,479
but...

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,680
but...

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,696
The fault is mine.

89
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,408
To protect my reputation,

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,199
the Empress Dowager
put in lots of efforts.

91
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,159
Uncle,

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,536
I did those to protect imperial honor

93
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,896
and avoid shame for you both.

94
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,720
I beg your understanding.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,319
A ruler's actions

96
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
should never be this reckless!

97
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:41,344
=Episode 8=

98
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,319
Where's Xiao Hu?

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,759
Class ended.

100
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,864
He's napping again.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,592
So

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,856
what's the truth
about the prince's origins?

103
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,000
In court today,

104
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,048
weren't you present?

105
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,840
Do you admit

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,319
the prince isn't Noble Lady Zhu's son?

107
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,704
I've given

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,976
sufficient explanation.

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,639
Then who truly birthed him?

110
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,600
Where is he from?

111
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,048
Are you asking for His Majesty

112
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,079
or for yourself?

113
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,079
Does my opinion matter?

114
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,728
Do you remember your words?

115
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,128
In the Imperial Library,

116
00:05:32,128 --> 00:05:33,600
you shared your wish.

117
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,920
With court in turmoil now,

118
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,879
please remember

119
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,040
your original wish.

120
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,720
The Imperial Library.

121
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,600
The book is upside down.

122
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,639
It appears

123
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,560
you already know why I'm here.

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,816
I just didn't expect

125
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,600
you'd reuse these old tricks.

126
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,839
Another closed-book exam?

127
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,879
What exactly happened in the library?

128
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,120
What really happened?

129
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,399
What's between them?

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,519
No. No.

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
I must find a way
to make him spill it today.

132
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,600
What now?

133
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,800
Cerebral ischemia.

134
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,360
Cerebral ischemia?

135
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,104
Weak vision and numb limbs.

136
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,288
What am I saying?

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,920
You mentioned
the Imperial Library earlier.

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,439
I just remembered many things.

139
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,000
My thoughts are racing uncontrollably.

140
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,040
He's blushing.

141
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:49,536
Progress.

142
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:50,639
Get him drunk!

143
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,839
Biyu!

144
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
Warm some wine.

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,816
Yes.

146
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,120
But you have cerebral ischemia.

147
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,680
Why drink alcohol?

148
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,199
You don't know.

149
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,008
Alcohol improves
blood circulation for recovery.

150
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,720
Better blood flow speeds healing.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,720
Your Majesty, you've truly changed.

152
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,000
Now versed in childhood education

153
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,199
and medical principles

154
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,319
to some proficiency.

155
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,560
Only passably.

156
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,759
The wine's ready.

157
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,079
Drinking alone lacks charm.

158
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,279
Perhaps

159
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,079
you'll join me?

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,600
I won't drink.

161
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,879
No one else is here.

162
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,519
Don't be nervous.

163
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,624
His Majesty needed me

164
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:47,744
in Qingliang Hall.

165
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:48,736
Since you're unwell,

166
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:49,536
please enjoy alone.

167
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,584
Your Majesty, the Imperial Tutor fled!

168
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,560
So hard.

169
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
How strange.

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,904
It's just regular wine.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,368
It scared him off?

172
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,112
Exactly.

173
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,319
Biyu.

174
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,040
Why don't you sit?

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,328
It hurts my neck
just watching you all day.

176
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,024
Your Majesty, I...

177
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:21,984
Sit. Sit.

178
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,279
Sit.

179
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,519
Biyu, answer me.

180
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,656
Master Chen doesn't drink normally?

181
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,759
I don't know.

182
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,480
I've truly never seen him drink.

183
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,519
Even at banquets,

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,480
the coronation,

185
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,879
birthdays or official feasts,

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,744
he avoids alcohol?

187
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:46,048
When would I witness such events?

188
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,639
If he drank,

189
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,519
you'd know.

190
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
How would I know?

191
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,799
Biyu.

192
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,344
Where are the Court Diaries kept?

193
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,456
I can't believe this.

194
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,552
The Empress Dowager's an alcoholic?

195
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,560
(Court Diaries)
Cheng Ziru and the Empress Dowager

196
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,799
spent two hours alone
in the Imperial Library?

197
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,759
Two hours!

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,176
That's two hours!

199
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
A man and a woman alone for that long.

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
They weren't just chatting!

201
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,472
This means

202
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,600
Xiao Hu might be

203
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,040
the Empress Dowager and Cheng Ziru's...

204
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,264
That's the answer!

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,320
Told you!

206
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,240
No one's sharper than me.

207
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,559
To the Regent's manor.

208
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,416
She stayed out all night?

209
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,896
Oh my heavens!

210
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,656
Why even have

211
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,416
different answers?

212
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,504
Good grief!

213
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:18,208
Your Majesty!

214
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,120
Your Majesty!

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Your Majesty!

216
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,039
The Regent's taking Xiao Hu away!

217
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,600
What?

218
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:25,200
Go!

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,728
Zhao Chengtian!

220
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,279
Perfect timing.

221
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,304
Choose how this child dies.

222
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,600
Crushed or drowned?

223
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,039
I have one thing to tell you.

224
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
Then I'll never obstruct your decision.

225
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,120
Say it.

226
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,184
What I stated in the court

227
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,000
was false.

228
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,159
You said many words.

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
- Which part?
- You...

230
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,639
This child

231
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,024
was born by me.

232
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,279
That night, your home.

233
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,639
This baby is my...?

234
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,159
Regent.

235
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:20,799
Give me.

236
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,080
Leave now!

237
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,919
Rong.

238
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,919
Too many eyes here.

239
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,039
You should return soon.
