=The Empress Dowager On A Second Spring=

21

Aren't we supposed to look for Xiao Hu?

22
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:16,896
Why come to your place?

23
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,400
The capital's vast.

24
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,959
There are just two of us.

25
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:23,200
Master Cheng.

26
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,200
Copy this portrait.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,400
Take three ways.

28
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,359
First, tell the Garrison Commander
to watch all city gates.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,599
Second,

30
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,400
discreetly check every inn.

31
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,439
Third,

32
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,519
track wet nurse traffickers.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Execute immediately.

34
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:37,879
Yes.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,480
Then what do we do?

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,359
We wait.

37
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,153
=Episode 10=

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,280
Have some food.

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,616
Don't worry.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,568
Xiao Hu's with Yu Feng.

41
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:02,400
They'll be fine.

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,519
True.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Just shake it off.

44
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,080
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

45
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,360
Let's dance.

46
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,759
Dance?

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
I don't know how.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,400
Come on.

49
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,639
I'll teach you.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,680
Hold me.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,479
Follow my lead.

52
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,400
Left foot.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,280
Left foot.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,776
Right foot.

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Left foot.

56
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,360
- Right.
- Left.

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,920
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,639
Is our conduct

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
highly improper?

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
A man and a woman

61
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,200
spent two hours alone
in the Imperial Library.

62
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,199
Was that proper?

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,039
Why not answer me?

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,048
Do you care?

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,912
Should I

66
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,039
not care?

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
What about the Regent?

68
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,304
We're talking about us.

69
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm not worthy of Your Majesty's 'us'.

70
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,000
May I interpret this as

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,872
your jealousy?

72
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:42,688
Fine.

73
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,720
Answer me this.

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
Why help me search for Xiao Hu?

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,736
Is Xiao Hu the Regent's son or not?

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,720
What does this have to do

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,448
with you?

78
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,592
Don't claim

79
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,152
your relationship with Xiao Hu

80
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,488
is merely mentorship.

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Do you think

82
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,808
my relationship with Xiao Hu
is merely mentorship?

83
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:04,928
Then what else?

84
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:06,400
Xiao Hu...

85
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,959
Never mind.

86
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,160
My point is

87
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,016
a mentor becomes lifelong family.

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,864
If I don't protect him,

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,816
who will?

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,848
Then answer this.

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,440
Is Xiao Hu

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,192
your child?

93
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Do you wish him to be?

94
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,839
Your Majesty,

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,989
last night a human trafficker

96
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,176
got Yu Feng a wet nurse.

97
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,759
He knows the way and will take us.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,664
What's wrong?

99
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,624
No time to delay.

100
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,279
You haven't eaten.

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,639
Forget food. Let's go.

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,024
Yu Feng!

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,720
Yu Feng!

104
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:15,520
Yu...

105
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,040
Where's he?

106
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Rest assured.

107
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,288
Xiao Hu had stranger anxiety last night.

108
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,399
Now he's napping.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,839
You don't think we'd harm him?

110
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,600
How did you find this place?

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Even I could find you,

112
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,639
let alone the Regent.

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,472
Since I brought him out,

114
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,120
I won't return him.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
What's your motive?

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,128
Ask Her Majesty.

117
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,079
Me?

118
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,759
Did I order your unauthorized move?

119
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,519
I swore an oath

120
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,839
to protect the First Prince
with my life.

121
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,160
I keep my vows

122
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,759
even if you forget.

123
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,959
How will you protect him?

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,248
Shall I just watch

125
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,439
the Regent kill him?

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,279
A drowning emperor

127
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,279
cannot save his heir.

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,784
Sending him back

129
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,240
would be killing him.

130
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,079
Set your mind at ease.

131
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,279
The Regent now believes

132
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,560
Xiao Hu is his son.

133
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,279
He won't act for now.

134
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,800
Your Majesty,

135
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,319
damaging your reputation
is irreversible.

136
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,120
The Regent might not even believe it.

137
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
I won't let Xiao Hu risk it.

138
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,360
I promise you.

139
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:26,839
When I'm here,

140
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,096
the child is safe.

141
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,759
You cannot enter.

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,168
Is it worth it?

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,279
No matter what,

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,279
you can't pass.

145
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
Gambling your entire career and life

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,240
for a child of unknown origins.

147
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,519
Is it worth it?

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,920
The First Prince's lineage
is unquestionable.

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,360
I know

150
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,040
your vile intentions toward Her Majesty.

151
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,896
Since you know my feelings for her,

152
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,976
then you should know

153
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,640
I would never harm Xiao Hu.

154
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,279
Cheng Ziru,

155
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,199
you're getting ahead of yourself.

156
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,544
Listen to me.

157
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,040
Xiao Hu's father

158
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,120
could be anyone but you.

159
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,680
I stake my life on this truth.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,279
(The Regent's son)

161
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,399
(mustn't be kept.)

162
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
(I must nip it in the bud.)

163
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,720
(Click, click, and click again,)

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,639
(Mulan weaves by the door.)

165
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,600
No sound of the loom's shuttle.

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
Only a maiden's sigh is heard.

167
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,639
Cheng Ziru!

168
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
You do harbor ill intentions.

169
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,624
I'll kill you!

170
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,576
Your Majesty,

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,159
he tried to kill Xiao Hu.

172
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,944
He can't live.

173
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,600
I didn't.

174
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,879
Our leave from the palace is ending.

175
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,039
Go buy me some time.

176
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,808
Go.

177
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,800
Your Majesty.

178
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,559
Go!

179
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,159
Yu Feng,

180
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,879
what are you doing?

181
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,399
It's my fault.

182
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,000
I've injured Your Majesty.

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,240
I deserve death.

184
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,480
I'm fine. Get up quickly.

185
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,159
Truly, I'm fine.

186
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:24,928
Look.

187
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,679
Stop!

188
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,039
Stop!

189
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:39,456
(Young Yu Feng)

190
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,168
Where are you?

191
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,320
Rong?

192
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,039
Yu Feng,

193
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,168
I'm right here.

194
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:49,152
(Young Jiang Rong)
