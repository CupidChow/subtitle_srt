Mai Tian,

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,240
go help me chop the herbs.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,080
Mai Xiang.

35
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,560
Come here.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
I'll ask you something.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,200
Go ahead.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,160
Answer me truthfully.

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,968
Okay.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,400
While I was away doing corvée labor,

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,960
did your sister have a secret affair?

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
Secret affair?

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Don't understand?

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean, was she involved
with another man?

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Wuming,

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
your jealousy is showing!

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
Yes or no? Answer me.

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,080
Whether there was or not,

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,400
a real man

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
should be broad-minded.

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,600
Nian.

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
We remain
a disgraced official's children.

53
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:05,400
Once I'm recommended
by the Prime Minister

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,280
and enter the court,

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,440
I can clear Father's name.

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,168
Then we'll be reunited openly.

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,960
May Crown Prince find peace

58
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,200
and smooth sailing

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
in the next life.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,920
If so many things hadn't happened,

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
we probably
would have been married by now.

62
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
I wouldn't have made

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
such a grave mistake.

64
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,320
We meet again.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
If you don't mind,

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
let's share a drink.

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
I don't know why,

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,040
but even though I don't know you,

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,120
every time I see you,

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,080
you feel strangely familiar.

71
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,960
I always end up sharing
what's on my mind.

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,880
Cheers.

73
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
People gather and part.

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Life vanishes like bubbles.

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Since we have this fleeting encounter,

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,840
what troubles you?

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
I'd be glad to hear it.

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,960
You're right.

79
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
After all, it's just a chance meeting.

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,680
Just listen, then forget it.

81
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
What happened?

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,400
Well,

83
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
I had an old friend.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
We grew up together

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,880
and were practically betrothed.

86
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,720
But fate was unkind.

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,560
He died

88
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
while still young.

89
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,000
The absurd thing is

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,840
that I don't even know how he died.

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,120
But you know what?

92
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Right now,

93
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
I kind of envy him.

94
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,920
Death is easy.

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,080
Life is hard.

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,640
My childhood friend died.

97
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
My long-lost elder brother.

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,480
I finally reunited with him.

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,040
But I...

100
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,760
But we...

101
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
I can't tell you.

102
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,600
Mai Tian.

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,944
Ye Wuming.

104
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
I've looked everywhere.

105
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Going out drinking without inviting me?

106
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,760
You poured for me.

107
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,680
Here.

108
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,120
No more drinking.

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,400
You want a drink?

110
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Come to me.

111
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,400
I can hold my liquor.

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
What are you doing?

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,400
Ye Wuming!

114
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Ye Wuming!

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,360
You're insane!

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I have a high tolerance.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
Stop trying to act tough.

118
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,720
You two know each other well?

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,160
We're complete strangers.

120
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,920
Then what are you doing now?

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,560
A chance encounter.

122
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,160
A chance encounter?

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,480
Once is happenstance.

124
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,760
Twice is coincidence.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,240
Three times? Still coincidence?

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,400
I may have amnesia,

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
but I'm not stupid!

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,120
You've been pestering my wife, right?

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,960
You're overthinking it.

130
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
Absolutely not.

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
It must be you.

132
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,120
You want to have two men at once.

133
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Nonsense!

134
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,240
How can you say that?

135
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,440
He defends you so fiercely.

136
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,880
You say you're strangers?

137
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't buy it.

138
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,280
It's a marriage of chance.

139
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,440
Believe what you will.

140
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,960
Yes.

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
It's a marriage of chance between us.

142
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Mai Tian.

143
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,000
If when we married,

144
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
you already loved another,

145
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,400
I won't play the villain
who tears lovers apart.

146
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,960
It's not like that. He and I...

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
(Right now,)

148
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
(to divorce him,)

149
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,320
(I can do anything.)

150
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,840
(Forgive me.)

151
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,400
(I'll use you.)

152
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:24,800
Fine.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,960
Then let's divorce.

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
You want to divorce me?

155
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,760
Because of him?

156
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
(Best if they divorce.)

157
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,040
(No more trouble.)

158
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll ask one last time.

159
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,400
