Morning.

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
There are so many rocks here.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Yes.

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,880
It's so bright out.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
Really.

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Let's go home.

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,600
Mr. Shen.

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,720
Good news.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,120
I've found

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
both your son and daughter now.

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,400
B-But...

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,040
They are

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,480
perfectly healthy,

46
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,240
but

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
their relationship isn't...

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,520
If only I had seen

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,200
this jade pendant earlier,

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,120
things wouldn't have

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,440
become so out of hand.

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
Now both of them...

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
I have

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,000
to keep a close eye on them every day.

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,240
I can't let them

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,560
make mistakes anymore.

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,400
When the moment is right,

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,880
I'll separate

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,520
the two of them.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,240
- I...
- I...

61
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,720
- You go first.
- You go first.

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
- Then I'll go first.
- Then I'll go first.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,000
- You'd go first.
- You'd go first.

64
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,840
Well...

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,480
We've married

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,120
for some time now.

67
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,680
What are your thoughts?

68
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Peaceful and joyful.

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
That's it?

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,120
That's it.

71
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
Just these two simple words?

72
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
Thoughts matter the most.

73
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,320
Not the fancy words.

74
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,240
Indeed.

75
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
We've married

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,040
for only a few days,

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,880
but I'll never forget

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,360
what we've been through.

79
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,520
You want to hear this, right?

80
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Ye Wuming, want to eat epimedium again?

81
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,480
I...

82
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
I don't need epimedium.

83
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,360
What did you say?

84
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:12,520
Anyway,

85
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
you need to learn herbs properly.

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
Don't eat what you shouldn't.

87
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,440
I'm going back to rest.

88
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,480
Mai Tian.

89
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,520
Would you like to be my real wife?

90
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:27,616
I thought about it.

91
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:28,845
I don't remember the past,

92
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:30,525
but it doesn't matter.

93
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:31,805
We should create

94
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:32,805
our own memories, right?

00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:28,320
You...

102
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,792
What are you doing?

103
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,245
Wiping sweat.

104
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:40,165
- Wiping his sweat.
- It's a bit hot.

105
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:40,885
Wiping his sweat?

106
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:42,112
Move. I'll do it.

107
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:44,045
Father.

108
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:45,245
Father.

109
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:48,285
Why does your rag smell a bit?

110
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,005
You bet.

111
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:50,496
Just cleaned the chamber pots.

112
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,725
What are you two up to?

113
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:58,805
Delivering herbs to Qianfang Hall.

114
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:00,224
What?

115
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:01,312
Hold on.

116
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,125
This bit of herbs.

117
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,205
She can do it alone.

118
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:05,845
You sit here

119
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,445
and wrap up all these.

120
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:10,285
It's not safe for her to go alone.

121
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,392
Go.

122
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,645
You sit down.

123
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:13,605
It's not safe if you go.

124
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,168
Go.

125
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:24,565
Take it.

126
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:30,085
Girl.

127
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,805
How much for this?

128
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,845
Take this candied hawthorn.

129
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,205
Don't cry anymore, okay?

130
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:40,285
It won't taste good
if it gets wet from tears.

131
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,325
Go.

132
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,245
Nian, be careful.

133
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:49,605
Candied hawthorn
won't taste good if it gets wet.

134
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:52,205
Everything you buy is delicious.

135
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:03,968
Brother?

136
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:06,405
Is that you?

137
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:22,880
Brother.

138
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,245
Brother.

139
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,304
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,245
It's not the time yet.

141
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:39,725
Brother.

142
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,445
I don't know you.

143
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:46,805
It's me.

144
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,005
I am Mai Tian.

145
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,120
No, I am...

146
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,525
Miss, please stop bothering me.

147
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:56,845
Miss,

148
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,165
we never knew each other.

149
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:05,504
On the 15th of every month,

150
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:07,405
at the Hong Bridge,

151
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,045
under the pear blossom tree.

152
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,845
Mai...

153
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:24,525
There you are.

154
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:34,325
This is...

155
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:36,845
Sir,

156
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,424
your wife mistook me for someone else.

157
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,925
Why do you know she's my wife?

158
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:48,845
Perhaps I made a mistake.

159
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:50,125
Let's go back.

160
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,565
Ye Wuming, I am here to see you.

161
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,645
Come on, let me take a look at you.

162
00:11:08,805 --> 00:11:09,645
I helped you,

163
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,245
why are you giving me

164
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:12,125
a cold shoulder?

165
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:13,120
Indeed.

166
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,565
I need to thank you.

167
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:16,605
Indeed.

168
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:18,845
A hundred taels can buy a lot, right?

169
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:19,936
Of course.

170
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:21,485
You need to repay it.

171
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:22,965
I will.

172
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,005
Not a coin less.

173
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:24,800
Let's go.

174
00:11:25,245 --> 00:11:25,952
Wait.

175
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,685
If you really can't repay,

176
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:29,245
then sell your wife

177
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,845
to a brothel.

178
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:35,405
