00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
Her name is Mai Tian.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
Then... what's my name?

What's his name?

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,680
Right now,

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
We have to go.

Come on.

74
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,560
Hold on!

75
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,760
What now?

76
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,864
Mai Tian, stop pretending.

77
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:22,880
Dare to make a bet with me?

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,400
If he is your betrothed,

79
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,280
I'll pay for your wedding.

80
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,120
But if he is not,

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
you will obediently become my concubine.

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Deal!

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,600

84
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,480
Woodshed?

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
That day,

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,640
(I stood outside the woodshed,)

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,080
(waiting to see you one last time)

88
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,320

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,800
I finally got to see you.

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,480
I came to say goodbye.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,880
Why?

92
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,680
I have to perform corvée labor.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
No.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,280
I won't give up.

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
I can't bear to part with you.

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,120
No.

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
We can't be together.

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,080
In that case,

99
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
I have no choice.

100
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,360
That's how it happened.

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,320

143

provide a decent dowry.

149
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,920
Don't say that.

150
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
You raised me.

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600

- Put it down.
- It's fine.

166
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:11,168
The magistrate paid for it.

167
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:12,064
Put it down.

168
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,560

200

But I can't remember anything now.

What is it?

206

Come on. Let's go home now!

215
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:57,400
What for?

216
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,120

I want to be a beautiful bride.

218
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,048
And I need to buy jewelry.

219
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,080
My father didn't know I left.

220
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,160
He must be worried.

221
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,400
Father,

222
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm getting married.

223
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,600
If you could attend my wedding,

224
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,560
please come as a butterfly

225
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,240

229
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,520
Blessed by heaven,

230
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
meant to be.

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,960
Master,

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
if you're watching this,

233
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,120
you must be happy for the young lady.

234
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Second bow to parents!

235
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560

236
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,360
with blessings unending.

237

Bride and groom bow to each other!

238
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,960
May the perfect couple

239
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,400

240
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,480
(Father.)

241
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
(I knew)

242
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,520
(you would come.)

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,480
Your Honor, that's him.

244
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,440
He suffered a head injury.

245
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,330
He lost his memory.

246
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,200
Lost his memory?

247
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
(Jin Chuan, whether you've
lost your memory or not,)

248
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,784
(you must die.)

249
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,360
(Pity there are many eyes.)

250
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,920
(Must find another chance.)

251
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,128
Your Honor,
are you leaving just like this?

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,400
Remember, you never saw me.

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Understood.

254
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,520
Drink slower.
