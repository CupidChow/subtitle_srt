it seems before the exams even began,

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
you already

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,120
predetermined the selections.

85
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,400
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,000
This is only a special imperial exam.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
I implore Your Majesty

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,000
to finalize the list promptly

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,720
for public announcement.

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,640
In that case,

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,000
you decide.

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,800

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,440
Your Majesty.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
The Crown Prince has passed.

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,480
The nation lacks an heir.

96
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,640
It may be better

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
to designate
the Crown Princess' unborn child

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
as the successor.

99
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,160
I am still alive and well.

100
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,360
In this matter,

101
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,760
you are

102
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,400
somewhat overhasty.

103
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
The court is restless.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,320
People are anxious.

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Without promptly appointing an heir,

106
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
it's hard to quell dissent.

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
But whether the child is male or female

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
remains unknown.

109
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,800
You can't expect me to appoint

110
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
a princess as heir, can you?

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
I guarantee

112
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,160
the Crown Princess' unborn child

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,200
will surely be a prince.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,320
This is also
the court's collective hope.

115
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Then let it be as you propose.

116
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

117
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Good buddy.

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,960
Sorry for tonight.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,680
What?

120
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,280
Understood.

121
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,960
Then I will

122
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,120
take my leave.

123
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
Where are you going, Mr. Su?

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,240
Your sister and brother-in-law

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,840
need to share their longing.

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,640
As an outsider,

127
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
I should make space.

128
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
That won't do.

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Nian.

130
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,720

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
prepared your room.

132
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600

133
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Wait.

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Mai Tian and I are married.

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,600
Brother-in-law.

136
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,840
You acknowledge me
as your brother-in-law?

137
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,320
I won't accept it.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
Shen.

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Even if you deny it,

140
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,120
those two...

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,200
None of your concern.

142
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,840
Eat mine.

143
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,480
Wear mine.

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Use mine.

145
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,360
Then you follow my rules.

146
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,000
Zhifeng.

147
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Don't be so harsh.

148
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,960
Ye Wuming isn't like that...

149
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Zhifeng.

150
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,760
Zhifeng.

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Then,

152
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
do I still need to move out?

153
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,200
There's no such thing

154
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
as a free lunch.

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,720
When you go to see your wife,

156
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,320
remember to close the door.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Don't be afraid.

158
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,600
It's me.

159
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,760
It's so late.

160
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
What are you doing out here?

161
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
To see me?

162
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,760
Yes.

163
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,960

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000

165
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
Aren't you here for me?

166
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
Of course not.

167
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
I came to watch the moon.

168
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,000
Tonight's moonlight is beautiful.

169
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
So beautiful.

170
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
Why does it feel like

173
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,000
we're having an affair?

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
An affair?

175
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
What nonsense!

176
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
We were wed

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,200
in a proper ceremony.

178
