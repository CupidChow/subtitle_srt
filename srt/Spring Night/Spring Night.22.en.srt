How dare you!

Please spare us!

38

Please spare us!

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Useless!

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,040
By order of the Prime Minister,

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,800
even the Crown Prince

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,640
must die.

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,480
His Majesty and the Crown Prince
were assassinated.

44
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,320
Prime Minister Qiu Xuanling

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,360
arrived too late to save them.

46
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,000
We only captured the assassin.

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
And this assassin

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
is none other than the son
of the criminal Shen Jinyuan,

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,960
Shen Zhifeng.

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,080
To avenge his father,

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,200
Shen Zhifeng assassinated the Emperor.

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,600
His crime warrants death.

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,240
Tomorrow in court,

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,640
Prime Minister Qiu Xuanling

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,080
will execute him on the spot.

56
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,800
And the child

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,520
in your womb

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
will be the sole royal heir.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
You will be

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
the Empress Dowager,

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,280
ruling from behind the curtain.

62
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
You're hesitating.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm one step away

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,640
from the imperial throne.

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
Why would I hesitate?

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
An unborn child as royal heir

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,280
hasn't occurred

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,280
since the Xiakang era.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,160
My plan this time

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,200
is quite inspired
by antiquity, isn't it?

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,160
At tomorrow's court session,

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
this throne

73
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,880
will change hands.

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Everyone,

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
His Majesty and the Crown Prince

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
were assassinated

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,240
last night.

78
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,760
Both have perished.

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
But fortunately,

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
the assassin
was captured alive on the spot.

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,360
The child in the Crown Princess' womb

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,760
is the sole remaining royal heir.

83
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,840
The Crown Princess should act as regent

84
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,000
until the royal heir is born.

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
Everyone,

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
any objections?

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,200
I object!

88
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
A fetus on the throne?

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,360
Unheard of!

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
You're acting

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,640
like a treacherous villain!

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,840
His Majesty
and the Crown Prince are dead.

93
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,480
The Crown Princess is my daughter.

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,560
I am the royal father-in-law!

95
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
You.

96
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,920
You.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,720
Who dares call me

98
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,080
a treacherous villain now?

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,320
Treacherous villain!

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,120
You!

101
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
You're still alive?

102
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,040
You're utterly lawless.

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,280
Qiu Xuanling.

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Look.

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
Know what this is?

106
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Everyone,

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,160
this is

108
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,440
evidence collected
years ago by Shen Jinyuan

109
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,800
of Qiu Xuanling's imperial exam fraud

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,440
and corruption of the court!

111
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,880
And you still deny
being a treacherous villain?

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What a joke.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
The words of that criminal Shen Jinyuan

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,640
cannot be trusted.

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,560
The evidence is here.

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,880
What other excuses do you have?

117
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,880
I'll restore justice for the Shens.

118
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,600
Now, I ask you.

119
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Who truly

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,160
caused my father's death?

121
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,880
Your father

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
was killed by this assassin,

123
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,680
Shen Zhifeng.

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,440
Shen Zhifeng is right here.

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Why execute him without trial?

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Do you intend to silence him

127
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
in front of everyone?

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Your Highness,

129
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
I'm loyal.

130
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,880
Why slander me so?

131
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Could it be...

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,760
that your delusional episode
has recurred?

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Ridiculous!

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Qiu Xuanling, I'm warning you!

135
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,720
I am still here.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,960
She is

137
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,160
unworthy of the throne.

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
Guards.

139
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,120
His Highness' delusional episode
has recurred.

140
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,280
Escort His Highness to his palace.

141
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
Who dares?

142
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,200
Her child is not the royal heir.

143
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:26,200
I am...

144
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,720
How dare you!

145
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,600
How dare a child of a disgraced minister
spout nonsense here!

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
I shall execute you this instant!

147
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,920
Kill me.

148
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Then you cannot kill him.

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,240
Have you forgotten

150
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,200
what I have taught you

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,640
through the years?

152
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,800
