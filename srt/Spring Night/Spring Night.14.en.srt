The neighbors said earlier

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
there was a carriage

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,880
marked with "Qiu" at the gate.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
That's the Prime Minister's.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,520
The Prime Minister.

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
While studying for the exams,

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,760
I heard of the power plays

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,720
at court.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,240
Prime Minister Qiu
has dominated for over 20 years.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,320
It's said that half the realm

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,640
answers to him.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,080
That's why he dares to act

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,520
so brazenly in murder.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,920
Father.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Ye Wuming.

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,440
Listen carefully.

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,680
Mai Tian is my only daughter left.

51
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,320
Keep her safe.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Father.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,720
Was the Prime Minister

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,920
targeting me?

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,840
I brought disaster upon my sister.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,040
Mai Xiang died in my place.

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
Everything is my fault.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,120
Mai Tian.

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Don't worry.

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
I'll uncover the truth.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
Mai Xiang won't die in vain.

(Tomb of Beloved Daughter Mai Xiang)

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
I have a gift for you.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,400
What did you do to her?

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,200
Relax.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,800
I haven't touched her.

67
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,520
How did you find out?

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,920
When my own man

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
develops divided loyalties,

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,320
I investigate thoroughly.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,720
I never imagined

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,440
the orphan I saved years ago

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
was a Shen family remnant.

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,160
Relax.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
My father remains unaware.

76
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
But...

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
he ordered me to eliminate

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,480
this child's true father.

79
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,720
How would you like to die?

80
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Look.

81
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Only I can save you.

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,720
Behave from now on.

83
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,120
Go finish

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,920
the unfinished task.

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Ye Wuming!

86
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,960
Su Chun!

87
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,160
Hurry!

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
Get them out here!

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,920
Come quickly!

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
The provincial exam results!

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
The results are out?

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,640
Mr. Su,

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
you passed the exam.

94
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:29,093
(Rankings)

95
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,960
What?

96
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,720
I really passed.

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Congratulations.

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,280
Mr. Su passed!

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,760
What about me?

100
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll check for you.

101
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
Let's look together.

102
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I'll find yours.

103
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,560
Hurry up!

104
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,640
Well?

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,840
Stop dragging it out.

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,400
Did I pass?

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
Just tell me.

108
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Am I on the list?

109
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Well,

110
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,720
after all this time

111
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
living together,

112
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,560
I never knew

113
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
you had such talent.

114
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Admit it.

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,840
You've been studying
secretly, haven't you?

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
You took first place!

117
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
I truly didn't expect

118
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
to rank first.

119
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,400
I botched one question.

120
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,040
I shouldn't have gotten top honors.

121
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,200
In a few days,

122
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,240
we'll head to the capital together.

123
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,840
Once we

124
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
earn our places on the final list,

125
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,600
we'll stand as one

126
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,920
for the nation.

127
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,400
For the people.

128
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
I own a private house in the capital.

129
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,560
Aren't you taking the exams?

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,560
Stay at my place.

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,240
Why should I?

132
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,120
Suit yourself.

133
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
(Ye Wuming.)

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
(Jieyuan is merely your first step.)

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,320
(I must get you to the palace exam)

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,440
(to stand before the Emperor.)

137
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Wuming.

138
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,400
It's okay.

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Grab our luggage later.

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,080
No.

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,960
(Capital Map)
I... I can't understand this map.

142
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,600
Take a look.

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Do you know the way?

144
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,360
This way.

145
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,840
Wuming.

146
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,040
Did you come here

147
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
for the exams before?

148
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,360
No.

149
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Why?

150
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Then how did you know the way?

151
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,320
Instinct.

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
Well...

153
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,840
You navigate by instinct?

154
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,000
The place Mr. Qiu prepared for us

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is actually quite nice.

156
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
It's passable.

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
Are these

158
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
the new clothes you got for us?

159
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I've heard

160
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,400
the plum wine from the tavern next door

161
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
is especially good.

162
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,040
I'll go buy some to cheer up.

163
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
What is it?

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,920
I want to talk to you.

165
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,720
I don't want to talk.

166
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,440
Well then,

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
want a beating?

168
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,960
Being under the Prime Minister
for so long,

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,240
you only know violence.

170
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
With that,

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,360
people listen.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Then let me remind you.

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
Even if you use violence,

174
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,160
you can't ignore your conscience.

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,040
I won't waste time arguing with you.

176
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,720
Just know this.

177
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
Protect Mai Tian well.

178
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Otherwise,

179
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,160
I will take your life.

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,040
From the sound of it,

181
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
you want to test my skills.

182
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,240
I'll oblige.

183
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Bring it on.

184
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,840
How about we find another spot

185
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,240
to settle this?

186
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
You're not late after all.

187
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,040
Miss Qiu.

188
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,640
What do you need?

189
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
I feel like killing someone.

190
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,960
Also,

191
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,840
I need a double

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
for my child's father.

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
In a moment,

194
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,040
the third man

195
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
walking out

196
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,560
