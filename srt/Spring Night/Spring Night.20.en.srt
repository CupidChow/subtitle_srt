Your Highness.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,720
I brewed a cup of calming tea for you.

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,840
Where is this little eunuch from?

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,400
He looks quite adorable.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,320
I haven't seen him

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,160
in the palace before.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,600
Newcomer.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,200
This eunuch

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
entered not long ago.

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,280
There's nothing.

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,480
You may leave.

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Yes.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
Don't have stray thoughts.

45
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,360
Wait.

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
Turn around.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,920
Okay, you may leave.

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,160
Your Highness, sorry.

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,600
Your Highness, sorry.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,160
I'll change your clothes.

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,680
No, no.

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
No need.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,080
No need.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll take my leave.

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,720
Mai Tian.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
Mai Tian.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Mai Tian.

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,400
Don't worry.

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,240
I promised you.

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,160
I will definitely do it.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Epimedium.

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
The Crown Princess

63
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,120
used epimedium on me?

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Someone.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,280
Here.

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,680
Go to the Archives.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,440
I want to see what the diaries

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,320
record about this.

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,320
Yes.

70
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,320
His Majesty has arrived!

71
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,360
His Majesty?

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,520
It's actually the Emperor?

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Father.

74
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Today,

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,600
the Prime Minister and I come together

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
to discuss important matters with you.

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,240
Where have you been?

78
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
Why the long delay?

79
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,160
I...

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,480
I was investigating something.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,840
Regarding the imperial exam fraud

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,480
you mentioned earlier in court...

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,920
Father,

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
I have a more urgent matter.

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
The Prime Minister is here.

86
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,560
Other matters can wait.

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
This concerns the Crown Princess

88
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
and also her father,

89
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,120
the Prime Minister.

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Qiu Yi.

91
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,760
Let me ask you.

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,920
Who is the father of the baby

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,160
in your womb?

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
What do you mean?

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,960
Could it be

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,680
that you suspect me?

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
(Diaries)
The diaries record

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,920
we never shared a bed after our wedding.

99
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,320
May I ask how you became pregnant?

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
Perhaps the diaries

101
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,440
merely omitted it.

102
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,400
Oh?

103
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,440
The diaries record

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
that after our wedding,

105
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,560
I kept traveling outside

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640
and rarely returned.

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,280
Shall we get an imperial physician

108
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,320
to date your conception

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,440
and see if I was in the palace that day?

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,000
Someone.

111
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,160
Go get a physician.

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Enough.

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,720
Father.

114
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
I said enough!

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
The diaries

116
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
were recorded incorrectly.

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
That should be the case.

118
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,200
Father.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,920
But the Crown Prince

120
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,960
harbors doubts.

121
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,520
The child in the Crown Princess' womb

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
cannot be kept.

123
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,320
Your Majesty!

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
The Crown Princess

125
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
hasn't visited
her family home for so long.

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Prime Minister,

127
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,320
you know what to do, correct?

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,760
Your Majesty,

130
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,080
I have an important matter to report.

131
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,240
What is it now?

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
I have investigated

133
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
the woman the Crown Prince married

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,760
in the countryside.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
She is the daughter

136
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,000
of Shen Jinyuan, the criminal minister

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,200
who was executed
along with his entire family back then.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Is this true?

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Father.

140
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
The Shen family was framed.

141
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,440
Please clear Mr. Shen's name.

142
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
Your Highness.

143
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
It seems you truly have amnesia.

144
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,600
Do not forget that back then,

145
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
the one who issued the edict
to execute the entire Shen family

146
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,640
was none other than His Majesty!

147
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,440
The remnants of the Shen family

148
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
naturally

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
shall be eliminated.

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,520
Father.

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,040
Father.

152
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Please see clearly.

153
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520
The Shen family was truly framed.

154
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,520
Remember.

155
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,440
You were born into the imperial family.

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,200
Prioritize the greater good
in all matters.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Is this "greater good"

158
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,720
worth the truth?

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,480
How dare you!

160
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,240
From today, the Crown Prince
is confined to his palace.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,920
Without my decree,

162
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,400
you are not to leave.

163
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
Father.

164
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Father.

165
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,720
Let go!

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,520
Father.

167
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
Father, please see clearly!

168
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,760
Let go! Let go!

169
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,920
Father.

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
Enough.

171
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,440
Your Highness.

172
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,560
A daughter of a disgraced official

173
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,160
raised in the countryside.

174
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Killing her

175
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,120
is of no consequence.

176
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Father.

177
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,400
Father, please see clearly.

178
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,400
Why?

179
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,400

of my father's killer?
