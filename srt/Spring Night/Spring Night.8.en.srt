the marriage certificate?

102

No.

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,520
No.

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,880
I mean,

113
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,240
why is it here?

114
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,680

It's not like it.

This pendant

117
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,400
looks more like

118
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,640
the other half of hers.

119
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,880
The other half?

120
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Right?

121
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,160

152
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
This is clearly a frame-up!

153

has a fake ingredient!

159

I truly don't have the money to pay you,

160
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,840
but I have a treasure.

161
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,800
I'll give it to you as compensation.

162
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,440
Is that acceptable?

163
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,560
Treasure?

164
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,360
Go die! You want treasure?

165
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
You frame me and still want treasure?

166
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,280
You want me to pay?

167
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,080

Daring to strike people now.

175
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,920
Tell me, why are you so fond of

176
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
