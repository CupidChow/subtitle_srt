35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,680
Odd Jobs Shop.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,200
Simply put,

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,160
we'll do anything

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,840
you don't want to

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,640
or you can't.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
Any job is all fine.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,920
Really? Any job?

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,640
Yes, I can do anything.

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,600
You look quite strong.

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
I got this.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm not feeling well today.

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
Hey, why are you leaving?

47
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,560
Hurry!

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,960
Hurry! Over there!

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,360
You're not good at this.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
Stab it.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
Stab it now.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
Go stab it.

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,720
It's too dangerous.

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,800
Ye Wuming.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Ye Wuming.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,360
Ye Wuming.

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,560
What can I do for you?

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,720
Are you planning

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,240
to pay off the debt with this?

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
This...

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,240
I didn't expect

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,160
earning money is that hard.

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
Where's your confidence?

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,080
What if you can't repay it?

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,280
Don't worry.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,840
I can do it.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
Water can fill me up.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
Eat first. I know you're
not used to it.

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
You earned little,

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
yet wasted one of my chickens.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,320
Don't worry.

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,280
I can earn the money.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,920
Alright.

74
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,880
Odd Jobs Shop.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
Can you help copy books?

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,200
Yes.

77
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,280
(The Domineering Prince)

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,640
The Domineering Prince.

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,280
I haven't read this one yet.

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
Stop it.

81
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,560
Go to sleep.

82
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
What's wrong with me reading it?

83
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I'll read for you.

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you sure?

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,640
Of course.

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,880
Write it.

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,880
Moonlight spills through the window.

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
The prince remembers the scene

89
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,480
that his princess smiled on the bridge.

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,120
He gets sentimental

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,880
and stands up

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,680
to find that figure

93
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,920
that he misses.

94
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,280
Then, the prince...

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,080
Why do you stop?

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,680
He removes her clothes,

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,880
leans in and kisses her.

98
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm sleepy.

99
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm going to sleep.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
You'd copy it yourself.

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,920
Wait.

102
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
What?

103
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,880
Well...

104
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,400
What are you doing?

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
What am I doing?

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Didn't you say

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
to read it for me?

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,240
Read it.

109
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
You haven't finished.

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm going to sleep.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,320
Nian.

112
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
Why aren't you asleep yet?

113
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
By the way, Mai Xiang.

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes?

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you remember what medicine

116
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,400
Mrs. Tang needs?

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,160
Do you want to deliver medicine to her?

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,680
Yes.

119
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,760
The mountain path there
is very difficult to walk.

120
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
It's in the deep mountains.

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,040
Mrs. Tang's son

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,640
offered one tael for a bowl
of decoction delivered.

123
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes.

124
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
The more

125
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,200
bowls I deliver,

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
the more money we can earn.

127
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,880
It's Ye Wuming's job, anyway.

128
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
It's fine.

129
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
I can do it.

130
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,640
Alright.

131
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,880
I'll go get the prescription.

132
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,360
Okay.

133
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,480
He's still copying books?

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
Poor brother-in-law.

135
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,280
Brother-in-law?

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
Nonsense.

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Mai Tian.

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,320
Why are you here?

139
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
What's wrong?

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,400
Twisted your ankle?

141
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,480
Let me check. Come on.

142
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,520
Why are you here?

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
I...

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,240
I was passing by.

145
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,280
What are you doing here?

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,920
I am here to earn more money.

147
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,280
Well,

148
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,440
you should've asked me to go along.

149
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,720
Come on.

150
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,080
Can you walk?

151
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,040
Yes, I suppose.

152
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
What?

153
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you doing?

154
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,080
You can't walk.

155
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,160
Watch out!

156
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,640
Where are you?

157
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,360
Mai Tian.

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,440
Mai Tian.

159
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,440
Mai Tian.

160
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,280
Mai Tian, answer me.

161
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Mai Tian.

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Mai Tian.

163
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,080
Where are you going? I'm right here.

164
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,680
That was so scary.

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,440
You have no idea

166
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,440
that huge rock...

167
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
My old friends.

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,680
You've been with me for years.

169
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,760
I have to sell you now.

170
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,280
Father.

171
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
What are you doing?

172
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,640
I'll pawn some decent clothes

173
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
for money,

174
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,600
so we can pay off debts.

175
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
These clothes

176
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,280
aren't worth much.

177
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,880
Sell these instead.

178
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,320
Before,

179
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,520
I was afraid Ye Wuming would find out
his identity, so I buried them all.

180
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,080
Now we need money,

181
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,760
so I dug them up.

182
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
That's my girl,

183
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
so clever

184
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,240
and capable.

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,200
Right.

186
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Sell his stuff.

187
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,760
Right.

188
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,880
These clothes are perfectly fine.

189
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,680
(This is)

190
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,760
(Young Master's jade pendant.)

191
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
I never expected to find
a pot in this wilderness.

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,400
It must've been left
by those herb gatherers.

193
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,240
This wild vegetable tastes awful,

194
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
but it should fill our stomachs.

195
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,440
Just wait longer.

196
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,960
Why did you save me?

197
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Do you know

198
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,120
how dangerous it was
when the rock fell?

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,560
That rock

200
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,800
was huge!

201
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,160
If I hadn't saved you,

202
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
we'd both be done for.

203
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,280
So,

204
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,880
I was saving both of us.

205
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,040
Silly girl.

206
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,400
Hmph.

207
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Anyway,

208
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,080
thank you.

209
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
But,

210
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,280
I saw

211
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,840
someone looking

212
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,800
really silly.

213
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,680
I was...

214
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,760
What's wrong?

215
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,040
Did you get hurt?

216
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,320
I knew it.

217
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
Let me check.

218
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,160
An internal injury?

219
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Ah.

220
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,720
Let me see.

221
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,200
I'm feeling hot.

222
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,880
Hot?

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
(Why?)

224
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,280
What is this?

225
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,480
The wild vegetable I picked.

226
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,440
What?

227
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
You fool.

228
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,760
This is epimedium.

229
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,480
What's that?

230
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
I-It's an aphrodisiac

231
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,080
for animals.

232
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,040
But I'm not an animal.

233
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,880
You...

234
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,200
How are you feeling now?

235
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,760
Should we go find a physician now?

236
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,680
What's wrong?

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,920
Ye Wuming.

238
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Calm down.

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Calm down.

240
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,600
But you only ate a bit,

241
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,680
so you would be fine, right?

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,280
Ye Wuming.

243
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't mean to.

245
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
I can't control myself.

246
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,480
I'm feeling so hot.

247
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,280
Ye Wuming.

248
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,360
Where are you going?

249
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
Don't stop me.

250
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm afraid I can't control myself.
