71
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Dig up this box.

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Find a chance

73
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520

Do you understand?

76
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,240
This is evidence of exam fraud

77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
discovered by my father.

78
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,360
