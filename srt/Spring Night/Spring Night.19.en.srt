00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,120
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm fine.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,080
Let the imperial physician

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
examine you first.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm fine.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,560
Seeing you,

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,160
all my ailments vanish.

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,080
How is his condition?

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
the Crown Prince's pulse
is deep and rough.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,480
It shows poor blood circulation,

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,480
a sign of blockage and stagnation.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,160
I fear his brain was injured,

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,320
resulting in memory loss.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Medication isn't advisable now.

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,560
Are there other treatment methods?

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,680
We can only wait for His Highness

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,960
to recover gradually.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
You may leave.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,080
Yes.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,480
My son,

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
I have let you suffer.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,160
Tell me,

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,480
who exactly harmed you?

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,200
I don't remember.

57
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
I can't recall anything.

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
So,

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,600
I am truly the Crown Prince?

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,880
Your Majesty,

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,760
are you my father?

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,080
You've just recovered from illness.

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,320
You still need

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,200
more time to rest.

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Oh, by the way,

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
I heard

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,720
you married a commoner
while living among the people.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
Yes.

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,720
Her name is Mai Tian.

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,760
She saved your life,

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
which is a great deed.

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,280
I can ensure her wealth and status,

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,600
but your marriage to her

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,720
should be considered null and void.

75
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,480
No.

76
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
Mai Tian is my lawfully wedded wife.

77
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
What lawful wedding?

78
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
For a prince to marry,

79
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,632
a ritual must be held
at Ancestral Temple.

80
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,200
How could a hasty marriage
among commoners count?

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,800
This marriage is invalid.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Your Majesty,

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,520
you say I am the Crown Prince.

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
I have not accepted this identity.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,880
But the fact
that I am Mai Tian's husband

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,120
will never change.

87
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,360
There are still positions
for concubines in the Eastern Palace.

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,280
Your Majesty, this is
absolutely unacceptable!

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,920
The Crown Prince was saved by a commoner

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,320
and took refuge in a village.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,320
If you wish

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,360
to repay her life-saving grace,

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,680
just reward her with money,

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,000
and ensure her livelihood.

95
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
Allowing a rustic village woman

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,080
to enter the royal family

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
is surely...

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,480
We'll discuss this later.

99
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,680
As for this woman...

100
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Your Majesty,

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,720
this is non-negotiable.

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,080
Unbelievable!

103
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,640
Go!

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,720
Bring Shen Zhifeng to me!

105
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Yes!

106
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Father.

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
You dare show your face to me?

108
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,280
Why wouldn't I?

109
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,360
Do you know

110
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
that the person you saved back then

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,320
was Shen Jinyuan's son, Shen Zhifeng?

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
He deceived me too.

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,080
Father,

114
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,920
it is not the time to assign blame.

115
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,320
The fact that the Crown Prince is alive

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,000
is already irreversible.

117
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Fortunately,

118
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,760
the Crown Prince has amnesia.

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
As long as I can make him believe

120
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,360
that we are a devoted couple,
bound by unbreakable love,

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
then all previous events

122
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,160
will cease to be a threat.

123
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,200
My guests,

124
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,360
your dishes are ready.

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,280
Please enjoy.

126
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,520
I heard this year's

127
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,920
top scorer, Ye Wuming,

128
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,160
is the Crown Prince
who went missing some time ago.

129
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,560
Speaking of which,

130
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,920
that Crown Princess
is truly a pitiful woman.

131
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,800
She was to endure the pain of widowhood.

132
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
Now the Crown Prince is back
and lost his memory,

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
not to mention

134
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,400
he has a wife outside the palace.

135
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
So now, who will be

136
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,560
the primary wife and who the secondary?

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
One is a noble lady,

138
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
the other a country woman.

139
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
Of course, he should choose
the noble lady!

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
Such a fickle man!

141
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,080
He seduces and abandons!

142
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
The old saying is right.

143
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,080
Men change for the worse
with money and power.

144
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,080
No way.

145
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,280
I need to hear him explain it
to me personally.

146
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
Waiter!

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,200
Leaving the money here.

148
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Got it! Take care!

149
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm actually the Crown Prince?

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,960
And I have a Crown Princess?

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,400
How do I explain this to Mai Tian?

152
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,560
Out.

153
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't want it.

154
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,000
I said,

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,760
out.

156
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,560

exactly this.

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
Why are you scoffing? I said get out!

160
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
Mai Tian?

161
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,040
