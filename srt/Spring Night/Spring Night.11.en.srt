Shen Zhinian.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,440
That's a beautiful name.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,240
Ye Wuming, what's wrong with you?

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Ye Wuming.

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you okay?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
I'm fine, Father.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
You must have caught a chill.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,000
Drink some ginger soup.

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,320

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Help me get things ready.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,440
Tomorrow, we'll take him to the academy.

45
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,480
Are you alright?

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,040
I'm fine.

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
Coming.

(Shen Zhinian.)

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,680

00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,848
(Luoshan Academy)

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
Alright.

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,240
Just leave me here.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,160
Well,

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,200
we're at the academy gate now.

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,080
I...

57
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,840
I don't know the way.

58
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,120
So, the man who wrote a poem here

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
and saved his wife

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,920
wasn't you, was it?

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
You just like embarrassing me.

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,600
My bad.

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,480
Study hard.

64
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm leaving.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
What?

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
You've forgotten one thing.

67
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
What are you doing?

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,240
We're at the academy.

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
Now everyone knows

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
that you have a wife.

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
Alright.

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
Now I can focus on studies.

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Go.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm leaving.

75
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
Take care.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,280
Got it.

77
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Excuse me, are you Ye Wuming?

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
Are you alright?

79
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,360
Come on.

80
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Sorry.

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,360
There's no need to bow like this.

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,920
You know me?

83
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
I am Su Chun.

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
I heard your heroic act

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
of composing poetry to save your wife

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,160
and mock Liu Chen here.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
I wasn't there myself,

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,720
but

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
just hearing about it

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,480
made my blood boil.

91
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,440
You flatter me.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,880
Not flattery at all.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,640
I heard

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,000
you've also been

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
helping villagers write legal petitions.

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
You can use your knowledge

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,720
to help common folk.

98
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,320
Unlike me.

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,520
All these years,

100
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,600
I've only studied and taken exams.

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm ashamed.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
My ambition

103
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
is to uphold conscience of the world

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,240
and stand for the people.

105
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Wuming.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,280
Let's talk inside.

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,840
Come.

108
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,560
Here.

109
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,560
Mind the steps.

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,000
It's an old disease.

111
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,360
Years ago, when I went

112
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
to the capital for the exams,

113
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
I publicly denounced a Prime Minister

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,160
for the unfairness of the exam system.

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
They threw me out,

116
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
shattered my knee

117
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
and stripped me of my title.

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
But it doesn't matter.

119
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
I will start over.

120
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:59,000
Your integrity is admirable.

121
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,720
Integrity or not,

122
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
I just want justice.

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
If I pass this time,

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,880
I'll shake the entire court.

125
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,640
Good!

126
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,200
If I'm fortunate enough to pass as well,

127
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,640
I'll help you cut away

128
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,160
all thorns of injustice

129
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720

Please.

161
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,520
May my husband pass the exams

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,680
and clear the Shen family...

163
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,360
No.

164
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,320
May my husband

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,920
stay safe and healthy.

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,320
Crown Prince's matter is settled.

168
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,400
Prime Minister has recommended me
for office.

169
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
Once everything is resolved,

170
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,160
I will come find you.

171
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Brother?

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,400
At this point,

173
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
how can you still deny it?

174
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
Tie the wish ribbon this way,

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,600
so it won't fly off.

176
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,200
And your wish will come true.

177
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,560
Brother.

178
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,520
You're alive.
Why didn't you come find me?

179
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,520
Why didn't you tell me who you are?

180
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,416
It's not that I didn't want to.

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,680
The situation isn't stable yet.

182
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
I don't want to bring you trouble.

183
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,440
I'm not afraid of trouble.

184
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
Where have you been all these years?

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,600
Have you been well?

186
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm working
under a certain official now.

187
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,680
Once I enter court service,

188
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,440
I'll uncover the truth back then.

189
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,080
That's good.

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,920
Which official?

191
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,280
The current Prime Minister.

192
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,160
The Prime Minister?

193
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Forget it.

194
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Some things

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,600
are better left unknown.

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,240
Alright.

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
I'll listen to you.

198
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,520
Come home with me.

199
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,920
Father will be overjoyed.

200
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,520
We must part ways here.

201
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
But we've only just reunited.

202
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,480
The matters in Penglai Village

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
are nearly over.

204
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
You just need to live well

205
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,320
with your husband.

206
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Remember.

207
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,880
Never mention

208
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,920
my affairs to anyone.

209
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Brother.

210
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
Are you in trouble?

211
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,560
Tell me.

212
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,960
We can face it together.

213
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Don't overthink it.

214
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Just live well

215
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:50,440
take good care of yourself,

216
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,400
and protect yourself.

217
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,560
Mai Tian.

218
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
Ye Wuming.

219
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,880
What are you doing, Ye Wuming?

220
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,120
What's wrong with you?

221
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
Why do you keep pestering my wife?

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,320
Why won't you leave us alone?

223
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Want me to make a move?

224
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,080
Ye Wuming.

225
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,400
He's here to say goodbye.

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,760
It's just a chance encounter.

227
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,800
Why bother?

228
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,960
Who is he?

229
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,800
I...

230
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,960
I truly don't know him.

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
I don't believe it.

232
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
You lost your memory, right?

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,760
What if I did?

234
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,640
You know me?

235
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,080
Since you've forgotten,

236
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,680
treat everything as a fresh start.

237
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Protect Mai Tian.

238
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,560
That's none of your concern.

239
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:55,120
Get out of here!

240
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,160
Listen to me.

241
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,960
Go!

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,320
Why'd I listen to you?

243
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Let's go.

244
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,960
Hurry!

245
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,280
Go!

246
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,160
Godfather.

247
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,800
It's so late.

248
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,160
What brings you here?

249
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Tomorrow morning,

250
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,120
Crown Prince's funeral procession
will depart from here.

251
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,880
Come make some arrangements

252
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
so nothing goes wrong.

253
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,160
Understood.

254
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,760
I'm listening.

255
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know how to explain this.

256
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,280
There are many things

257
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,800
I can't tell you right now.

258
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
Can't tell me?

259
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
We are husband and wife.

260
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
Doesn't it count?

261
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,600
No.

262
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,240
I really can't.

263
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,960
As expected,

264
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
you still can't let go

265
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
of that man.

266
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,400
I...

267
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,440
What you just did

268
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,320
was stalling, right?

269
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
No.

270
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,440
I'm just a tool

271
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,120
to help clear

272
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,920
your father's name.

273
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Ye Wuming, what are you saying?

274
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,320
Don't worry.

275
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll do as you say.

276
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,680
Ye Wuming.

277
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,520
(Ye Wuming.)

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,800
(I'm sorry.)

279
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,040
(About what my brother is involved in,)

280
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,840
