(Shen Mansion, fifteen years ago)

33

Brother.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm scared.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,480
Stay calm.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,200
I'll go distract them.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,640
Run when you can.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,440
On the 15th day, meet me at Hong Bridge
with this jade pendant.

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,280
Got it?

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,520
Hong Bridge On the 15th day.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
Survive.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,480
And I'll come find you.

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,856
(This jade pendant...)

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
(Is she)

(Nian?)

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Why haven't you found her yet?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,320
I need to see her,

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,320
alive or dead.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Remember.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,160
I saved your life.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,360
Understand?

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Yes.

53
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
Good.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Remember.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,040
Act by my orders.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,960
He acts by your orders.

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,080
What about mine?

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,680
Father.

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,240
What brings you here?

60
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
Do you know your mistake?

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
Father.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,280
I know I was wrong.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,880
Don't you forget

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,200
it was Qiu Yi who saved you back then.

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,000
We

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,520
saved your life.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't disappoint me.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,480
The Crown Prince's faction
has been eliminated.

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,160
If you fail again,

70
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
don't ever come back.

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
As for you,

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,720
just remember.

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,560
No matter what,

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,264
the child you are carrying

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,680
is the sole heir to the throne.

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,000
Then

77
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
the Crown Prince...

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,440
The Crown Prince

79
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
is dead.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,120
Did you sleep well?

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
Pretty well.

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,800
Me too.

83
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,240
What happened last night?

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
I don't know.

85
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,800
I-I...

86
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll go get the medical kit.

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,200
Cockroach!

88
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,960
Hurry!

89
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Kill it!

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,680
It's huge!

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
You're afraid of cockroaches?

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,840
Can't you tell?

93
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
Just kill it!

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,240
No.

95
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,480
I read in a book

96
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,640
that cockroaches eat their own kind.

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,200
Killing one attracts more.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
What should we do?

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Use boiling water.
Pour boiling water on it.

100
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,880
It makes sense.

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,600
I'll go get it.

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,800
It's coming!

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Here it is!

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,680
Why the fuss?

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Let's go eat.

106
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,480
Right,

107
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Father asks you to go to the temple.

108
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,360
Remember to do it.

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,960
You are so timid.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,560
Oh, no. It'll attract more.

111
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,873
(Guanyin Temple)

112
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,600
What wish did you make?

113
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know. I have no memories.

114
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,480
I don't know who I should miss

115
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,680
or what to wish for either.

116
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,480
Then guess

117
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,680
what I wished for.

118
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,680
What?

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,600
I wished for Father

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,640
to be healthy and live long.

121
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,760
I wished for Mai Xiang
to be happy every day.

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,120
And,

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,360
hope you can regain your memories soon.

124
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,240
Then I know what to wish for now.

125
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,160
Guess what it is.

126
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,880
I wish for you

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,320
to always be healthy

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,360
and happy.

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
Thank you.

130
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,120
Too soon for that.

131
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,240
What's this?

132
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,960
Cockroach repellent powder.

133
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,520
This stuff isn't cheap.

134
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,840
We usually can't bear to use it.

135
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,280
Use it sparingly.

136
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,960
Hmph. Who...

137
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,520
Who...

138
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,600
Who needs it?

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,880
Keep it yourself.

140
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,880
A cockroach

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,680
is under your foot.

142
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,440
Where?

143
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,240
Where is it?

144
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,120
Hmph.

145
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,720
Come on.

146
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,800
This way.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,640
Put it here.

148
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,040
Line them up neatly.

149
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,320
That's fine. Thank you.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,520
Take care.

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,040
Mai Xiang.

152
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,040
What's going on here?

153
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,280
Ye Wuming bought it.

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,600
Ye Wuming?

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
Does he have money?

156
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,720
He only has

157
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,320
three coins for vinegar on him.

158
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
He couldn't have more.

159
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,400
Top-grade silk.

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,720
How about it?

161
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,480
You like it, right?

162
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,600
For me?

163
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Yes, all of this.

164
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,440
I don't need it.

165
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,080
You're my wife now.

166
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,280
By the way,

167
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,200
where did you

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
get this money?

169
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,640
I borrowed it.

170
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,674
(IOU)

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,280
Look.

172
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Press your thumbprint

173
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,360
on this paper.

174
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
I'll lend you a hundred taels.

175
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,200
You can buy whatever

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,880
you want.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,360
No one will ever kick you out.

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
As long as you repay the money

179
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,640
within the given time.

180
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,160
It's easy to repay

181
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,120
a hundred taels.

182
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,946
(IOU)

183
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,000
(Loan shark?)

184
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,320
Divorce! I must divorce you!

185
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,200
Get out!

186
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,560
This life is unbearable!

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,960
Why?

188
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,240
Why?

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
A hundred taels!

190
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,200
It's a huge amount.

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
That's a hundred taels!

192
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,080
Just a hundred taels. Why the fuss?

193
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
Nian.

194
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,320
He has a head injury.

195
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,800
He lost his memories.

196
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
He lost his memories.

197
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
At least, he should be sane.

198
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,320
Nian.

199
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,800
Calm down.

200
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
What are you waiting for?

201
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
Apologize to her now!

202
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,680
Apologize?

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,800
What for?

204
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Just a hundred taels.

205
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,880
It is too little

206
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
for me.

207
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,680
I can't buy a lot.

208
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,680
I have plenty to buy.

209
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,960
Ye Wuming, I'll end you!

210
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I'll end you!

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,040
Stop! Don't run!

212
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,000
Stop!

213
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,520
I never expected
Ye Wuming to be so gullible.

214
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Please rest assured.

215
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,040
It's a huge debt.

216
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,040
He couldn't repay

217
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
within the given time.

218
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
They're on the verge of divorce.

219
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,920
Then,

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
you can

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,160
win over Mai Tian's heart.

222
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,280
If you find your head

223
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
too heavy,

224
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,760
I can help you.

225
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,320
I wouldn't dare.

226
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,960
(Nian, only if you part)

227
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,840
(will you be safe.)

228
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,080
Ye Wuming.

229
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,800
I...

230
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,720
Wait.

231
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
I told you so.

232
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
We're all family.

233
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,400
Don't always

234
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,680
resort to violence.

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,920
Every problem

236
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,520
can be solved

237
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,360
by talking it out properly.

238
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,000
You must keep

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
a peaceful mind.

240
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
Keep a peaceful mind.

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
Keep a peaceful mind.

242
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,880
What?

243
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
It's impossible.

244
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,880
Father, look.

245
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,680
IOU.

246
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
Borrower, Ye Wu...

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
Ye Wuming.

248
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,320
One hundred taels!

249
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,080
You signed it?

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,600
Yes, I did.

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
Too little, right?

252
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,480
I knew I borrowed too little.

253
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Father, look.

254
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,960
He's being ridiculous.

255
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,880
Peaceful.

256
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,960
Don't fight.

257
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,600
Peaceful.

258
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,760
If you have to,

259
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
you can use...

260
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Not this one.

261
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,080
We're all family.

262
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,040
We should try our best
to keep a peaceful mind.

263
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Try our best.

264
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,400
Father, you didn't say so.

265
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
You've borrowed so much money,

266
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
yet you still

267
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,960
have the nerve to nitpick me?

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,280
How are you going to repay this?

269
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,320
I've figured it out.

270
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,520
I plan

271
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
to start an Odd Jobs Shop to earn money.

272
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,840
Odd Jobs Shop.

273
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,600
(Odd Jobs Shop)

274
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,840
What is that?

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,840
Simply put, I will do everything.

276
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,240
If anyone needs help,

277
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,400
they can come.

278
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,160
Who does it?

279
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,720
Me.

280
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,160
Of course, me.

281
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,480
With my abilities,

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,080
I believe I can

283
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,600
repay a hundred taels soon.

284
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,280
Good.

285
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
Then

286
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,920
do what you say.

287
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,240
Go out now

288
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,560
and make money.
