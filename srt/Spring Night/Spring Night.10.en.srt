32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm telling you.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
When the emperor saw

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,840
his only son

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,440
dead beyond recognition,

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,680
he wept bitterly and passed out.

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,760
He hasn't attended court for days.

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,240
The entire court

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,800
is now under my control.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,560
How did a mere county magistrate

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,280
dare to make a fool of me!

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,200
Do you know how much gold

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
I've given the Prime Minister?

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Madam.

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Bring a pot of wine.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,760
Prime Minister?

47
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,400
Prime Minister!

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,800
Your student greets you.

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,720
Rise.

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,560
It's you! Why did you kick me today?

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,720
This man was harassing women
at the academy

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
and running his mouth,

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,840
claiming to be your disciple.

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,440
Prime Minister, don't you remember me?

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
I'm Liu Chen, the jieyuan scholar.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,760
For this title,

57
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,560
I gave you a whole chest of gold

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,880
and a high-grade jade ruyi scepter!

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,720
Have you forgotten?

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
Oh, it's you.

61
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,040
Seems I shouldn't accept money

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
from just anyone anymore.

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,000
Especially from fools like you.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Prime Minister!

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,280
Clean this up.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,920
(The Crown Prince's death is confirmed.)

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,160
(Penglai Village
is no longer under scrutiny.)

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,120
(If Crown Prince truly lost)

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,160
(all his memories,)

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,280
(living quietly as Ye Wuming)

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,840
(with Nian)

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,160
(might be a good thing.)

73
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:37,216
(Odd Jobs Shop)

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Guo Daqiao, right?

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,200
Sister!

76
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:46,680
Right.

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,480
Hurry up! I'm exhausted.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,200
Come help Wuming grind the ink.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Grind the ink.

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
There are so many people.

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,840
You're number one.

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,960
Number two.

83
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
Number three.

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Number four.

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,880
Number five.

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,440
Please wait.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,880
Let me introduce you.

88
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Your headband's loose.

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Well,

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,360
weddings...

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,080
Whatever you need. We handle it all.

92
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Done.

93
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,080
No need.

94
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480
Done.

95
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,520
Why are you tying everything

96
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,760
like that?

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
Tying it this way makes it tighter.

98
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,160
I see.

99
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
You only know this one knot, right?

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
No such thing!

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,560
Drafting a legal petition.

102
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,160
(How could this be?)

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Okay, take a look.

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,368
(This isn't the knot
my brother always ties.)

105
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,120
Are you sure it wasn't him?

106
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
Maybe he just forgot.

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
The mind may forget,

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,960
but the body remembers.

109
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,240
Therefore,

110
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
Ye Wuming is definitely not my brother.

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,960
If he's not,

112
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,760
how do you explain the jade pendant?

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,320
There may be another explanation.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,240
But Ye Wuming cannot be my brother.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,600
If he's not,

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
why does he have the pendant?

117
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,000
Anyway, he's not my brother.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't be mad.
I didn't say it must be him.

119
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,840
There are still many things

120
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,320
we haven't sorted out.

121
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
No matter what,

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
I need to talk to him
and clear things up.

123
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
Mai Tian.

124
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,440
Don't argue with him.

125
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,040
How am I supposed

126
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,640
to explain to him?

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,760
I treated him badly.

128
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
He must hate me by now.

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
Got it.

130
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Perhaps

131
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,560
I can make him some clothes.

132
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,560
But I don't have

133
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
much time for clothes.

134
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,080
And the fabric's from others.

135
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,160
Besides,

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,480
I didn't even take his measurements.

137
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,360
Maybe make some food?

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
No way.

139
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm not a good cook.

140
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,160
What should I do?

141
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
Forget it.

142
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,560
I'll just say it straight.

143
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,120
Anyway, he wouldn't kick me out.

144
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Today's earnings.

145
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Ye Wuming?

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,280
This is today's take.

147
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,240
Ye Wuming.

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,760
Let me see how much.

149
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,520
So much!

150
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
Ye Wuming.

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
Ye Wuming, I need to talk to you.

152
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,440
Mai Tian.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,120

because of the imperial decree.

If you regret it,

156
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,680
I'll let you go.

157
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,720
I didn't mean that.

158
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,000
Then what do you mean?

159
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,160
treat me differently.

161
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,840

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,480

199
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,760
So you thought

200
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,400
I was your long-lost...

201
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,160
Brother?

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
That's ridiculous!

203
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,360
Why was the jade pendant with you?

204
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
So

205
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,880
you really don't know
where it came from?

206
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,080
I don't remember at all.

207
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,080
But it's okay.

208
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
At least

209
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,200
our misunderstanding is cleared up.

210
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,440
As for the jade pendant...

211
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,920
One day,

212
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,200
I will remember.

213
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,360
I was worried

214
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,640
you hated me because I kept my distance

215
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,400
lately.

216
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,760
How could I?

217
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,840
I thought I had done something wrong.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
I overthought it all day.

219
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
Wait.

220
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,120
What is it?

221
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,280
So the childhood engagement

222
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,400
and my corvée labor

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,400
were all lies?

224
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
You know the situation.

226
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,600
I had no choice.

227
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,760
Alright.

228
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,280
I know.

229
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,560
It's fine.

230
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,680
I've lost my memory anyway.

231
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
All I know now is

232
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,040
that I'm your husband,

233
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,520
and you're my wife.

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,520
I knew you'd say that.

235
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,400
Father!

236
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
It's late.

237
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,440
What are you doing out here?

238
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not here to interrupt.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm looking for this.

240
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Ye Wuming.

241
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,800
There's something you need to know.

242
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,880
Actually,

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,120
Mai Tian isn't my biological daughter.

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,160
Father!

245
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,160
He's your husband now.

246
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
He has to face this truth.

247
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,520
(To stand for the people.
To uphold conscience)

248
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,000
The owner of these paperweights

249
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
is Mai Tian's real father.

250
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,400
Fifteen years ago,

251
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,000
Shen Jinyuan

252
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,680
was framed.

253
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
The entire Shen Mansion was executed.

254
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,240
At that time,

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,560
only his son and daughter escaped.

256
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,080
I was an old servant of the Shen family.

257
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
I risked my life

258
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,480
to save them.

259
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
But

260
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,160
the Shen family's eldest son
has since vanished.

261
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,360
And Mai Tian is Shen Jinyuan's daughter.

262
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,160
Father.

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,120
Four Sentences of Hengqu.

264
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,080
I never expected Lord Shen

265
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,280
shared the same ideals

266
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,600
as Master Mingcheng.

267
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
Remarkable.

268
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
Ye Wuming.

269
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,440
You're good at learning.

270
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
Are you willing

271
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
to take the imperial exam,

272
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
enter official service,

273
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,560
and someday

274
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,240
clear Lord Shen's name?

275
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,160
I am willing.

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,520
Great.

277
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
Then, what is your real name?

278
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,360
Shen Zhinian.

279
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,440
Shen Zhinian?
