Mai Tian.

34
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:06,240
Get out!

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,240
I'll pay you back.

36
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:14,205
May I ask your name?

37
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,405
You take care of her first.

38
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:22,205
You all right?

39
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:31,765
I told you to protect Mai Tian.

40
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,685
How did she end up like this?

41
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:34,805
Father.

42
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:35,805
Not his fault.

43
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,525
He meant well for me.

44
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:38,685
On his side again.

45
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,005
Alright, alright.

46
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,085
You sit here.

47
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:41,925
I'll talk to her.

48
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:42,885
Don't follow us out.

49
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:45,525
Go, go. Hurry up! Go!

50
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,085
Oh, right.

51
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:57,325
I also have something
to say about my elder brother.

52
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:58,285
Your brother?

53
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:00,165
Then let's go!

54
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:00,845
Quick!

55
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:04,005
Mai Tian.

56
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:07,165
You want to talk to me
about Zhifeng, right?

57
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:10,525
I know.

58
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,045
It's all my fault.

59
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:14,605
My fault.

60
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:15,765
Father.

61
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:17,205
How can I blame you?

62
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:18,205
Did you

63
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,565
already know?

64
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:21,565
I just found out.

65
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:23,365
Otherwise,

66
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:24,685
I wouldn't make such a mistake.

67
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,045
I failed you.

68
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,445
I made such a huge mistake.

69
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:28,965
What huge mistake?

70
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,525
Did my brother

71
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:32,765
do

72
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:34,045
bad things?

73
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,365
Not just bad.

74
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,845
It's monstrous!

75
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:42,125
Father.

76
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:43,965
What exactly

77
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:45,085
did my brother do wrong?

78
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:47,325
Not just him.

79
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,405
And you.

80
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:50,965
And me.

81
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:55,565
But I only met my brother today.

82
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,405
You just met him?

83
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:01,485
But I've seen him for days.

84
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:03,245
Then... Ye Wuming...

85
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,525
Ye Wuming met him too.

86
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:06,965
But he didn't know

87
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:07,925
that was my brother.

88
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:09,765
Actually, I'm not sure.

89
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,045
But just seeing him like that

90
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,325
made me feel

91
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:14,765
he must be my brother.

92
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,085
Wait a second.

93
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:18,285
What is it, father?

94
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:20,965
Actually, I want to tell you

95
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,405
I also know about Zhifeng.

96
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:24,365
Really?

97
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:25,765
Then tell me quickly!

98
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,165
This is my brother's jade pendant.

99
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:48,085
Where did you find it?

100
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,245
It was found

101
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:52,205
when we rescued Ye Wuming.

102
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,205
It was in his old clothes.

103
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,245
Ye Wuming is very likely

104
00:04:58,245 --> 00:04:59,725
your long-lost

105
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:01,365
elder brother.

106
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:08,365
What?

107
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:36,165
What are you doing?

108
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:38,165
Let go!

109
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:55,965
No!

110
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:12,725
Mai Tian.

111
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,885
Father sent me to bring you some food.

112
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:20,365
Let's go out to eat.

113
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:21,525
Eat something good. Go.

114
00:06:24,565 --> 00:06:25,165
Ye Wuming.

115
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,925
Let me ask you something.

116
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:29,245
The 15th of every month.

117
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:30,885
Does that date

118
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,285
sound familiar?

119
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:33,925
No.

120
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:34,885
Really?

121
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:35,965
Really, no.

122
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:38,605
Important anniversary?

123
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:40,085
I lost my memory.

124
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:40,805
I don't remember.

125
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,005
You can remind me.

126
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:43,725
Then do you remember

127
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,165
if you had any family heirlooms, like

128
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,205
a jade pendant?

129
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:49,485
Family heirloom?

130
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,365
I don't remember that either.

131
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:58,645
Fine. I'll go first.

132
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,045
Mai Tian, what's really going on?

133
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:02,165
Why act like this?

134
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,125
Is it because of that man?

135
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:05,405
Who is he?

136
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,165
I don't know him.

137
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,085
You don't know him?

138
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:10,165
You lost

139
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,045
your memory too?

140
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,064
Right?

141
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:13,845
Unreasonable.

142
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:15,525
Move out of my way.

143
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,525
Where should I go?

144
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:19,605
What are you doing?

145
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:20,685
What am I doing?

146
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:21,885
We're a couple.

147
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:23,245
I don't want this.

148
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:24,765
Don't forget our deal.

149
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:25,965
We're siblings.

150
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,405
Sir, you summoned me?

151
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,120
Earlier today, were you trying

152
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,285
to play the hero
in front of that girl Mai Tian?

153
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:57,765
Some time ago,

154
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:00,325
the Crown Prince
was ambushed and fell off a cliff.

155
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,405
He vanished without a trace.

156
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:03,765
The Crown Prince?

157
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:07,045
So I intended to kill one
of my subordinate guards

158
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,845
to serve as the Crown Prince's corpse.

159
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,165
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

160
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,440
Sir?

161
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,805
I don't quite understand what you mean.

162
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,085
Please be blunt.

163
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:18,805
So,

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,165
you have to die.

165
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,525
Even if you've committed
countless evils,

166
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,125
and death is too good for you,

167
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:32,045
that would have been none of my concern.

168
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,565
But you shouldn't have harmed my sister.

169
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,485
(Impartial and Incorruptible)

170
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:45,152
Father.

171
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,125
The prince was shot and fell.

172
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,965
When his body was found,
beasts had already mutilated it.

173
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,205
Unrecognizable.

174
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:57,805
Fine.

175
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:00,805
You've done well.

176
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,045
Didn't you wish

177
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:06,005
to serve in the court?

178
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:07,765
You'll start

179
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,445
as a ranked official

180
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,525
in the Personnel Evaluation Bureau.

181
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:12,565
Thank you.

182
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:15,685
Father.

183
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:18,365
I could have handled this matter.

184
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,085
Why trouble yourself to come?

185
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,685
A loyal minister

186
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:25,365
must act like one.

187
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,005
Do you understand?

188
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:29,445
Yes.

189
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:39,365
Your Highness,

190
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:43,405
I've finally

191
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,925
found you.

192
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:51,365
I failed you.

193
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:54,605
I've failed His Majesty!

194
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,405
I am guilty.

195
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:08,605
I deserve death ten thousand times over!

196
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:16,965
(Obituary Notice)

197
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:23,173
(The Crown Prince has passed.)

198
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,165
The Crown Prince

199
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:27,165
has passed away.

200
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:43,005
What's wrong?

201
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:45,165
You seem distracted.

202
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:50,965
Father.

203
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,845
The Crown Prince is dead.

204
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,165
I passed a notice today

205
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,045
and saw

206
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:05,605
the obituary notice.

207
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,325
I know

208
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,885
when you were young,

209
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:16,645
you were betrothed to the Crown Prince.

210
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,005
But later,

211
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,765
your family fell into misfortune.

212
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:23,005
So the betrothal was annulled.

213
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:25,925
I've heard

214
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,525
the Crown Prince married
the Prime Minister's daughter.

215
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,005
Alright.

216
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,605
All that is in the past.

217
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:37,525
Don't be too sad.

218
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,365
I understand.

219
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,005
I just didn't expect him

220
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,445
to die so suddenly.

221
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:46,565
This is the fickleness of fate.

222
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:50,965
Take Ye Wuming, for example.

223
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:53,685
Who would have thought
he's your long-lost elder brother?

224
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,285
And you two even met.

225
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,045
Father.

226
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:57,045
