Wuming's been gone for hours now.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Stop being so smitten.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
You're still young.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,000
You'll understand when you're married.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
Speaking of which,

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,320
what kind of man

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,880
do you want to marry, Mai Xiang?

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,040
Me?

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,280
I want someone

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
who's obsessive.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,160
He needs that fragile aura,

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
domineering in public,

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,680
but around me,

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,360
he must beg for my affection humbly.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,560
And handsome too.

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,480
You say I'm smitten?

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,680
Seems like someone else here

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,400
is the truly smitten one.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,480
I'm not talking to you!

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
Alright,

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,200
don't worry.

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,560
When it's time for you

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
to marry,

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
I'll find you the perfect husband.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,200
Then I'll prepare a lavish dowry

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,920
to see you wed in style.

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,960
That's more like it.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
I want a gold bracelet on my left wrist

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,280
and a jade bracelet on my right.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,600
I'll buy ink and brushes for Wuming.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
Mind the house.

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
He needs to be rich.

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
What bridal sedan should I have?

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
An eight-bearer grand...

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,080
Sis!

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,360
Sis!

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
I'm mad.

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,720
That is Mai Tianlin's daughter,

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Mr. Qiu.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
Girl.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,760
My lord,

73
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,920
how can I help you?

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,080
Are you

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,800
Mai Tianlin's daughter?

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
Yes.

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Girl,

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,600
is your father home?

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
My father?

80
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
He isn't home.

81
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
He went to gather herbs
in the mountains earlier.

82
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
My lord,

83
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,080
would you like to rest inside?

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
I can go to the mountains

85
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,800
to tell him you're here.

86
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,160
No need.

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
No need.

88
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
No need.

89
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:13,834
Yes.

90
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
What are you doing?

91
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,520
- Move.
- Why are you arresting me?

92
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,600
What are you doing?

93
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,720
Let me go!

94
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,488
(Dried tofu)

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,160
Why did you come?

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
You're in danger.

97
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
You'll put Mai Tian in danger too.

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Isn't it you who's putting her
in danger?

99
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,080
As her brother...

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
How do you know?

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Not your business.

102
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
I warned her

103
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
not to tell anyone.

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm her husband.

105
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Why couldn't she tell me?

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
What kind of brother are you?

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,920
All these years,

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
no matter your reasons,

109
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,160
you should visit her

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,440
and let her know you're alive.

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,840
How could you bear

112
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,760
her suffering in that backwater?

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
Do you even have a heart?

114
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Circumstances forced it.

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,760
It's not your concern.

116
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
It is my concern now.

117
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,480
I'm her husband.

118
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
I'll protect her for life.

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,280
Unlike you,

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
who only runs from responsibility.

121
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Your marriage was just circumstantial.

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,880
Times have changed.

123
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,200
She and I

124
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,320
are genuine.

125
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,400
I'm her true husband.

126
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
And you are unworthy

127
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
of being her brother.

128
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,200
True husband?

129
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,680
Then how have you protected her?

130
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,720
She's in danger now

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,960
entirely because of you.

132
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,680
It's all because you hid your identity

133
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,824
and won't acknowledge her,

134
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:51,360
so she mistook me for you.

135
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,080
Speaking of this,

136
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,760
why is your jade pendant on me?

137
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Enough nonsense.

138
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
(I held back because of Nian,)

139
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,800
(I didn't make my move.)

140
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
(But now it's urgent.)

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
(It's secluded here.)

142
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,360
(Might as well)

143
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,560
(eliminate this threat.)

144
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
(Your death)

145
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,120
(benefits everyone.)

146
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,440
Zhifeng!

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,480
What are you doing?

148
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,720
It's nothing.

149
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
We're messing around.

150
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
What brings you here?

151
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
If I ever find out

152
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,160
you've wronged my sister again,

153
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
I'll kill you on the spot.

154
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,680
Zhifeng!

155
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
No more talk!

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,280
Hide in the mountains.

157
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,040
Stay hidden.

158
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,280
I'll come find you.

159
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Protect yourselves.

160
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
Zhifeng!

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,200
Explain yourself!

162
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,080
What do you mean?

163
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,760
Let's hide first.

164
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,120
He wouldn't harm us.

165
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,880
Let's go.

166
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,680
I always feel

167
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
he's hiding many secrets.

168
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
We'll discuss it later.

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,600
Let's go.

170
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Who are you really?

171
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,360
Who do you think I am?

172
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Shen Zhinian.

173
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,280
Shen Zhinian.

174
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
(Is he after Tian?)

175
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,480
That Shen Jinyuan

176
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,680
actually had a daughter like you.

177
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,920
I never expected

178
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,680
to have let you slip through.

179
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,360
From now on, I'll make sure

180
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,200
to leave no loose ends.

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
What?

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
What do you mean?

183
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,880
What did you do to my father?

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,160
Your father?

185
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,760
Not just your father.

186
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,120
All 17 members of your Shen family

187
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,000
were slaughtered by me.

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,560
Today, it's your turn.

189
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,480
Aren't you afraid of divine punishment?

190
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,360
Divine punishment?

191
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,160
Divine punishment?

192
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Then let it come!

193
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,200
Bah!

194
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
You fool!

195
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't you miss your father?

196
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,040
Very well.

197
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,680
Today, I'll send you

198
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
to reunite

199
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,760
with your family.

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
(Tian...)

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,560
(Too bad, you won't see me get married.)

202
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
(Take care of Father for me.)

203
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,920
Wait!

204
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,240
What is it?

205
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Mai Xiang and Father don't know yet.

206
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,080
I forgot.

207
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Here's the plan.

208
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll find Father.

209
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,720
You find Mai Xiang.

210
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,400
Okay.

211
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Mai Tian,

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
be careful.

213
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
You're late.

214
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Miss summoned me.

215
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
That's why I'm delayed.

216
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,520
Is that so?

217
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,320
Shen Jinyuan's daughter...

218
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,080
How could I let you live?

219
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,680
Clean this up.

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
Mai Xiang!

221
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:54,790
Mai Xiang...

222
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,080
Mai Xiang!

223
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,280
Mai Xiang!

224
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,400
Wake up, Mai Xiang.

225
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
Wake up, Mai Xiang.

226
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
You asked me to trust you.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,800
You asked me to trust you.

228
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Then you killed my sister!

229
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,600
You killed my sister!

230
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Get out!

231
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,760
Get out!

232
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
From now on,

233
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
I want

234
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
nothing to do

235
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
with you.

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
Get lost!

237
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Mai Xiang!

238
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,000
So beautiful!

239
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
Tian.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,880
Tian!

241
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
Who did it?

242
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
Who did it?

243
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,480
Mai Xiang!

244
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
Mai Xiang!

245
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,600
Mai Tian.

246
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,360
Mai Tian.
