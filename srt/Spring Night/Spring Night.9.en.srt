You all right?

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm fine.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,720
Come, get up.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,040
So it was you

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
who insulted my wife?

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,400
You lowly commoner.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,160
How dare you talk like this?

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,880
Your Honor. By the laws,

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
any dispute

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
must hear both sides.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
Why do you take only one side?

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,400
I am a juren scholar,

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
steeped in books and learning.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,200
But you

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,240
are nothing but illiterate peasants.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,120
Whose words are more credible

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
is obvious.

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,960
A so-called scholar

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,120
calls people "peasants" at every turn.

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,920
Your learning can't be much to speak of.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,960
I honestly wonder how you placed first.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
Are you doubting my talent?

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,320
Dare to wager with me?

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
How?

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,520
Half an incense stick.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
We each write a poem.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,440
If mine is worse,

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,800
I'll let this matter go

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
and give up my juren scholar's title.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,640
But if yours loses,

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,360
your punishment will be fifty lashes.

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
No!

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,960
I accept.

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,440
Your Honor, please be the judge.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
Alright.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,160
Ye Wuming is up
against a jieyuan scholar.

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,840
Mai Tian's family is in trouble now.

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,560
You're doomed.

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,480
Your Honor, I've finished.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Good.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680
One by one they come,

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,720
thin-feathered, sharp-tongued.

74
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Eager to soar, but never far.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
Pointed beaks,
eager to sing, but never true.

76
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,880
Hmph.

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,080
It's sparrows.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,240
(Luckily, few in Penglai Village
are literate.)

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,480
(Just a bunch of uneducated villagers.)

80
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,720
(Any scribble will fool them.)

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,120
What's so funny?

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,480
Forget

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
the poem itself.

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,400
Your handwriting

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
is terrible.

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,560
I... I...

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,720
Enough with the glib talk!

88
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,240
Where's your poem?

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,640
At the doors of power, gold runs deep.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
Hollow titles dress the walls,
a lie believed.

91
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,240
No ink in the heart,
a counterfeit top rank,

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,440
stinking of money,
yet he claims success.

93
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,760
It's you.

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
- Well said!
- Great!

95
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,120
How incisive!

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,960
Truly well-aimed.

97
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
You dare mock me?

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
Poetry is written

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,040
from whatever comes to mind.

100
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
You don't even know that?

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,800
You!

102
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,600
(So what?)

103
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
(In the end,)

104
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,360
(it's still the magistrate who decides.)

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Your Honor.

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,960
Both poems are done.

107
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,240
Please give your judgment.

108
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,280
There's nothing more to discuss.

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,280
Scholar Liu's poem is refined
and brilliant.

110
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,680
Ye Wuming's is confused
and poorly expressed.

111
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,960
Naturally, Scholar Liu wins.

112
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,080
This is blatant injustice!
What a rotten magistrate!

113
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,920
Silence!

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,040
What do you villagers know about poems?

115
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

116
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,600
A backwater bumpkin

117
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
dreams of playing the hero.

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,280
Ridiculous.

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,800
Guards! Drag Mai Tian out!

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Fifty lashes!

121
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,400
You...

122
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,120
Wait!

123
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,480
I wrote the poem.

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,880
If there's punishment, I'll take it.

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
You say you'll take it?

126
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,440
Who do you think you are?

127
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,240
Your Honor.

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,200
This man used poetry to ridicule me.

129
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,840
I have a request.

130
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
Go on.

131
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
If this wretch

132
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,280
whips himself

133
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,760
in front of everyone,

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,520
I ask that he be allowed

135
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
to take the punishment in her place.

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,280
Guards!

137
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,680
It's fine. I can take it.

138
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,680
Hit hard! Make it bleed.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,080
No blood doesn't count.

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
One.

141
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,560
Two.

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,680
Ye Wuming.

143
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
I've never seen

144
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,400
someone whip himself before.

145
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,960

I can take it.

162
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,280
only see me as your brother?

How dull.

164
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,560
Do the whipping myself
may be more interesting.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,800
Let go!

166
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,680
Whip me!

167
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,680
Let go!

168
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Acting out a tragic scene?

169
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,960
What a pity.

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,920
I hate that the most.

171
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
Insolent peasant! Do you know who I am?

172
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,720
I'm a disciple of Prime Minister!

173
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,560
Shut up.

174
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
Prime Minister would never associate
with someone like you.

175
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,120
I'll report this to the court,
strip you of your title

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,200
and deal with your crimes.

177
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,280
Get out!

178
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,880
Why are you so silly?

179
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,680
It's okay. Just surface wounds.

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Let me tell you.

181
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,920
Liu Chen is nothing but a waste.

182
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,960
He couldn't even lay a finger on me.

183
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,400
It doesn't hurt anymore.

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,480
See? I can still move.

185
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
You...

186
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,880
Sister, here's the healing ointment.

187
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
Apply it for Wuming.

188
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Hurry!

189
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
Well, when dad gets back,

190
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,760
let him do it.

191
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
Who knows when dad will be back?

192
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
Wuming is badly injured.

193
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
Right?

194
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,040
Right. Exactly.

195
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,720
See?

196
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,200
He's in so much pain.

197
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,160
Hurry up and do it.

198
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,320
I'll step out now.

199
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,320
Alright, I'll apply it.

200
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,240
It might hurt.

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,760
I haven't started.

202
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,520
I...

203
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm just testing it.

204
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,480
Don't yell. Is it really that painful?

205
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,360
You... You're hurt there too?

206
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,640
Yes, I guess.

207
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,280
Stop!

208
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,080
Mai Tian, give me the ointment.

209
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,840
I'll apply it for him.

210
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,280
Okay.

211
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,160
Mai Tian.

212
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,480
Dad, I'm injured.

213
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
It really hurts.

214
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,400
Don't worry.

215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,000
I've been putting medicine
on people for years.

216
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,200
It always hurts.
