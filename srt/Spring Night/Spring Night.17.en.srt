00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,760
what happened to you?

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,880
Mr. Su,

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,240
why were you so desperate?

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
Wake up.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,880
You passed the exam.

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,920
You passed!

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
We can fulfill our ambitions!

62
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,880
- Wake up!
- (I, Su Chun,)

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
(native of Jinyang,)

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
(swear with my blood.)

65
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,320
(I accuse the Prime Minister
and examiners)

66
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
(of manipulating the imperial exam)

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,880
(and defying the law.)

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
(During the exams,)

69
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,200
(they allowed cheating by relatives.)

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,560
(After the exams,)

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,040
(they discarded papers
from non-Jiangnan regions,)

72
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,440
(ignoring students'
decade-long efforts.)

73
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,120
(Those on the merit list)

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,000
(are all Prime Minister's cronies.)

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,200
- Save him.
- Ye Wuming.

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
- Ye Wuming, don't do this.
- Save him!

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
Ye Wuming, calm down!

78
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,960
The note says

79
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
he died demanding investigation
into exam fraud.

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,000
Look!

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
Capital Prefecture on duty!

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,280
Clear the area!

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,200
Su Chun, the juren scholar?

84
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,240
I thought he already passed as jinshi.

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,440
Why commit suicide?

86
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,160
He must've been overwhelmed by success

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
and overjoyed.

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,280
This is

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
an accidental fall.

90
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Alright. Case closed.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,640
Let's go.

92
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,400
Wait!

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,840
Su Chun was a juren scholar

94
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,320
with official status.

95
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
He died abruptly.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why rush this?

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,480
Ten years of hardship

98
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
led to success.

99
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,560
Are madness cases really so rare?

100
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,200
What's strange?

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,256
And the blood letter?

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,480
This blood letter

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
shows his dying conviction.

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,720
He used this extreme way

105
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,040
to expose court injustice.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,640
You...

107
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,520
You...

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,440
Would you really turn a blind eye?

109
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,200
What blood letter?

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,360
Ye Wuming.

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,120
What are you doing?

112
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,440
Ye Wuming, calm down!

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,080
Ye Wuming.

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
In broad daylight,

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,680
how dare you destroy evidence?

116
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,160
What evidence?

117
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,864
- You fool!
- Ye Wuming.

118
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,400
Ye Wuming.

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,360
Ye Wuming, don't!

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,000
No evidence

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
means no nonsense.

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,640
Move!

123
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,000
Move!

124
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,280
Oh, right.

125
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
Keep watch on him.

126
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,024
- Yes.
- Move!

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
- Disperse!
- Go!

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,600
What you staring at?

129
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,760
Such busybodies!

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,237
Ridiculous!

131
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
Ridiculous!

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Ye Wuming.

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
Ye Wuming, don't do this.

134
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,000
(Laughing heartily,
I step out the door.)

135
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,320
(How could we be common folk?)

136
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
(Declaring with blood.)

137
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
(A death well deserved.)

138
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
(How splendid!)

139
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
(How splendid!)

140
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,960
(Wuming, see you in the next life.)

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Mr. Su.

142
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,680
To our ambitions.

143
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,040
What do you plan to do?

144
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
To fulfill Mr. Su's dying wish,
of course.

145
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,640
But his blood letter has...

146
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,200
It's fine.

147
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,120
I have learned everything

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,080
in Mr. Su's blood letter.

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,840
Some wield unchecked power
in the streets.

150
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,520
At the palace exam,

151
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,160
I'll present every injustice

152
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Mr. Su suffered in the imperial exam

153
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,480
before His Majesty.

154
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,680
Let's see who dares

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
block His Majesty's ears.

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,040
This world is unfair.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,200
Blood must summon thunder!

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,880
If Mr. Su's blood proves insufficient,

159
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
add mine to it.

160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
And mine as well.

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Zhifeng,

162
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,520
Ye Wuming faces
the palace exam tomorrow.

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Could there be danger?

164
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Since the third year of Jiayou,

165
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,160
the palace exam no longer
fails scholars.

166
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,920
Worst case, they receive Jinshi status.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
But tomorrow,

168
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
he'll stand before His Majesty,

169
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
condemning the exam's injustice.

170
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Su Chun

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,520
already died for this cause.

172
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,120
I fear for him.

173
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,160
Don't worry.

174
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,200
Ye Wuming knows his limits.

175
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Go rest now.

(Once Ye Wuming appears at the exam,)

179
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,000
