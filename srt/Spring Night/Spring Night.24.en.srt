(The land is well governed,)

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
(with people living in contentment.)

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,632
(One year later)

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,000
That's it.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,920
This special imperial exam.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,560
Proceed according to this plan.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,440
Yes.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Anything else?

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,320
I've heard

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,840
people say in Your Majesty's study

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,200
hangs a divorce paper.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Seeing it for the first time today,

49
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
I found it rather novel.

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,920
What do they

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,320
say about it?

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
They all speak of
Your Majesty's incognito story

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,000
with Miss Shen.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,440
Some bold opera troupes

55
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,840
have even adapted it into operas.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,760
And the ending of these operas?

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
Is it reunion?

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
Or separation?

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,160
These operas have no ending.

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,440
Because everyone feels

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,360
Your Majesty and Miss Shen's story

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,520

When the Emperor

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
was still the Crown Prince,

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,360
he killed the traitor and cleared

68
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,920
Especially when suppressing
the rebellion,

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,920
he was valiant and skilled,

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,200
unmatched by anyone!

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,200
Was he truly that formidable?

72
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,520
Of course!

73
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,800
After that,

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
the imperial exam became fair,

75
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,160
no more favoritism based on region.

76
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,960

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Of course I can.

193
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:54,440
What kind of book?

194
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,160
- Well...
- The Domineering Prince?

195
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,800
Oh, stop it!

196
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,240
Of course, it should be our story!

197
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,720
Just make it

198
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,720
about this thick.

199
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
A book this thick?

200
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,280
Won't my eyes get sore reading it?

201
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
Sore eyes would be even better.

202
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,520
I'll read it to you.

203
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,800
You'll read it to me?

204
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Then I'll want to hear it once, twice,

205
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,920
three times...

206
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,400
many times.

207
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,160
You finish writing it first.

208
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
A cockroach!
