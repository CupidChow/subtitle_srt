After the palace exam ends,

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
His Majesty will announce

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,720
that the child in my womb

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is the royal heir.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,680
Aren't you happy?

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
What if the child

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,440
isn't a boy?

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
What if it's a girl?

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,920
You really know how to ruin my mood.

41
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm very angry.

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,480
Don't talk back to me anymore.

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
Ye Wuming,

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
I can't let you take this risk.

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
What are you doing?

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Untie me.

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,040
Mai Tian!

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,400
Mai Tian, untie me!

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,280
What risk? Come back!

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Mai Tian!

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
Come back, Mai Tian!

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,440
(You always protected me before.)

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
(Now, it's my turn.)

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Mai Tian!

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,160
I suppose

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
this must be the top scorer, right?

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,640
Steady as a mountain.

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,160
Like he's in deep meditation.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
It seems he has a well-thought-out plan.

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,480
I doubt it.

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,800
He just wants to do something outrageous

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
to show off.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Despite severe illness, His Majesty
presided over the palace exam,

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,800
screened by gauze to uphold his dignity.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,880
Such dedication

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,360
is truly a blessing
for scholars everywhere.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,760
His Majesty is still in the hall.

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,480
How can we whisper
amongst ourselves here?

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

71
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,160
Look! He's writing now.

72
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,920
This...

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,600
It's written in blood!

74
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,320
To uphold conscience.

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
To stand for the people.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,760
To preserve the wisdom of past sages.

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,000
To secure peace for all generations.

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,240
Your Majesty!

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
I, Ye Wuming,

80
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
beseeches you to investigate unfairness
in the imperial exam.

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,080
Ye Wuming?

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
Hurry!

83
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,040
Mai Tian went in my stead.

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,880
She's in danger.

85
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,120
Such insolence!

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,840
A mere juren scholar

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
not yet ranked,

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,480
dares to spout such nonsense,

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,480
railing against the grand
talent selection.

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,280
Outrageous!

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,680
Official posts are frequently sold
in Jiangnan.

92
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,080
Most officials serving at court today

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
are proteges

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,680
cultivated by you, Prime Minister.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,120
Your Majesty, please investigate.

96
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,160
Grant justice to scholars
who yearn to serve

97
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
but find no path
into government service.

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,680
All current officials

99
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,360
were educated

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,680
by the Imperial Academy

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
and these veteran academicians.

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
They have nothing to do with me!

103
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,280
Someone!

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
Drag him out!

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,080
Let me go!

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Go!

107
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,200
Go!

108
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,480
Zhifeng, what are you doing?

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
Why did you bring him here?

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,880
I left him at home

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,800
to come in his place.

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,680
Listen to me.

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,400
Some things

114
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,880
must be done by him personally.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,880
Why?

116
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
You'll understand soon.

117
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:25,920
Zhifeng!

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
It's you?

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,200
You...

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
(He's actually alive?)

121
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,640
I, Ye Wuming,

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
presume to intrude here.

123
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
My crime deserves death.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Your Majesty, please

125
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,320
investigate the exam corruption.

126
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,240
Rebellion.

127
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,040
This is rebellion!

128
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Someone!

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
Drag him out!

130
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,160
Stop!

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Your Majesty,

132
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,640
investigate the exam corruption

133
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,440
and uphold justice for all scholars!

134
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,520
My son...

135
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Look up.

136
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,400
Your Majesty?

137
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,520
Raise your head.

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Jin Chuan?

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
My son!

140
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
Your Majesty,

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,520
I come from Penglai Village.

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
My name is Ye Wuming.

143
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,920
I am not the Crown Prince.

144
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,720
I only ask you

145
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
to investigate the exam fraud.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,920
You are my Crown Prince!

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,120
How could this be wrong?

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
His Majesty is delirious.

149
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,640
Escort him back to his chambers, now!

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,920
Your Majesty!

151
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,360
My son Jin Chuan is still alive!

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,160
He's back!

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,040
He's back!

154
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
What?

155
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
The Crown Prince is back?

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

157
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,040
You didn't kill the Crown Prince?

158
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
No.

159
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,880
I personally escorted him

160
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,440
to the palace hall to meet His Majesty.

161
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,120
You dare betray me?

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,920
I haven't!

163
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
I did it to protect you.

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
Protect me?

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
The Crown Prince is back.

166
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
We'll all be executed!

167
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,920
Even if he hadn't returned,

168
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
the Prime Minister would still kill you.

169
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
He wants the throne for himself.

170
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
Can't you see that?

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Come with me.

172
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,080
Let's go

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,840
somewhere nobody knows us.

174
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
Have our baby there.

175
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
Raise our child together.

176
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Do you truly

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
refuse to come with me?

178
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Go with you?

179
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,800
What can you offer me?

180
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,840
To remain Crown Princess,

181
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,440
enjoying boundless wealth

182
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
and having everything,

183
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,520
or to wander the world with you,

184
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
living hand to mouth?

185
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,120
What should I do?

186
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
It's obvious.

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
Is it that I don't understand?

188
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,600
Or that you don't understand?

189
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,760
But the Crown Prince doesn't love you.

190
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,240
And you don't love him either.

191
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Love?

192
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,640
Is it important?

193
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
I'm afraid the Crown Prince
will hurt you.

194
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,560
He has lost his memory.

195
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
He doesn't remember how bad

196
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,920
things were between us before.

197
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,840
On the contrary,

198
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
I can use him.

199
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Yes.

200
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,440
That's right.

201
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,240
I didn't expect

202
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,120
that you didn't kill him,

203
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,960
yet left me a way out.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,400
What if I tell him the truth?

205
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,920
Don't be foolish.

206
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,400
Our goals are the same.

207
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Now,

208
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,200
you only have

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,560
two choices.

210
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,560
Either

211
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,920
help me,

212
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,720
or

213
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,320
kill me.

214
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,520
Then just help me.
