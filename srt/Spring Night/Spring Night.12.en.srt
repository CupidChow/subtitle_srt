(Imperial Edict)

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,000
Ancestors above,

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,600
I, Qiu Xuanling,

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,800
have not brought shame
upon our forebears.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,080
Now,

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,120
His Majesty has decreed

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,360
that I

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
serve as regent with full authority.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
Father,

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
it seems

44
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240
the Crown Prince's corpse

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,640
has devastated His Majesty.

46
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,200
Of course.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,320
Seeing

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,520
the Crown Prince's disfigured body

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,880
left him utterly heartbroken.

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
He fell gravely ill.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Now,

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
the entire court

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,680
is in my grasp.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
Once you bear the royal heir,

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,280
no one

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
will be able to stop

57
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,640
our cause.

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,280
Congratulations, Father.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,160
Therefore,

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
remember this.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,600
Protect the child
in your womb at all costs.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,400
No mistakes allowed.

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,160
Understood.

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,600
I have never

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,480
pressed you about whom that man is.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
I wished to spare you the shame.

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,400
But given the situation,

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,040
that man you disgraced yourself with

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,000
cannot remain alive.

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
I understand.

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,200
If you show any mercy...

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,240
Rest assured, Father.

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,640
I will personally deliver

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,480
his head to you.

75
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
Remember your promise to me.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,880
You're back.

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,840
You've left for so long.

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Did you miss me?

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,320
Come on.

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Come here.

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
Didn't you say

82
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
you liked street food?

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I had someone get this for you.

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
Do you like it?

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,440
What business do you
have with me, my lady?

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,520
What's wrong with you?

87
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,280
What?

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Securing an official post

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
and entering the court,

90
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,240
have you forgotten who your master is?

91
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,600
Or perhaps,

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
something happened

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,400
in Penglai Village?

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,680
I would never keep anything from you.

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
Good.

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,880
If that's all,

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,440
I'll report
to the Personnel Evaluation Bureau.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm done with you now.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
That official robe of yours
is such a turn-off.

100
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
Get out.

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Someone!

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Investigate

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
what really happened

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,240
in Penglai Village.

105
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

106
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:28,823
Why'd I listen to you?

107
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,016
Let's go.

108
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,440
Could it be

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,000
the Shen family's jade pendant?

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,800
Is it possible someone
from the Shen family survived?

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,040
Go to Penglai Village.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
Investigate thoroughly

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,720
whether any remnant
of the Shen family is still live.

114
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes.

115
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
You've been studying all day.

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,800
You must be exhausted.

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,640
No.

118
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,640
Still angry?

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
No.

120
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
I won't live on handouts.

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,320
Nonsense!

122
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
I made this for my husband.

123
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,040
How can that be handouts?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Husband...

125
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,800
Who knows what you're thinking?

126
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,560
Who was that man?

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,000
You still refuse to tell me.

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,400
He is my brother.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,200
My blood brother.

130
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
Brother?

131
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,520
The Shen family?

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
So that's how it is.

133
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,600
It was me overthinking things.

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,200
I have kept pressing you.

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
I apologize.

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
It's fine.

138
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,880
My brother told me

139
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,200
I can't tell anyone

140
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,840
about his affairs.

141
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,800
But you're my husband.

142
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want to keep secrets
from you anymore.

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,280
Silly girl.

144
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,400
Alright.

145
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Since that's the case,

146
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,680
then I

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
can't hide anything from you either.

148
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Hide something?

149
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,200
Ye Wuming,

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
what's going on with you?

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,840
You still have secrets?

152
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Tell me.

153
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,920
Sit down and you'll find out.

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
Don't try to dodge this.

155
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Hurry up and tell me!

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,880
I lost my memory.

157
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,600
I don't know.

158
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,720
How can you do this?

159
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,680
Wuming,

160
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,360
I...

161
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,400
I'll go first...

162
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
It's all your fault!

163
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,200
How is that my fault?

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Wuming,

165
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,120
go home.

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is the academy.

167
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,800
Doing this here
changes the nature of this.

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
Why did you answer him?

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,096
'Why did you answer him?'

170
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,840
Who would've thought

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,400
the daughter of the disgraced official
Shen Jinyuan

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
is actually alive,

173
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,920
and is hidden

174
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,360
by the servant Mai Tianlin

175
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
in Penglai Village,

176
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,200
disguised as a common girl.

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,400
Interesting.

178
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Feng,

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,400
didn't I tell you before?

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,480
When coming to see me,

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,040
you don't need to wear court robes.

182
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,600
Everything is at your discretion.

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,720
Now, most of the imperial court

184
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,640
is under my control.

185
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Since you work
at Personnel Evaluation Bureau,

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
there are certain matters

187
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
you should help me with.

188
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,920
Yes,

189
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,680
Godfather.

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Do you know of Shen Jinyuan?

191
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,280
No, I don't.

192
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,600
You certainly wouldn't know.

193
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,840
He was an old friend of mine.

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,400
15 years ago, he was convicted.

195
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,120
His entire family was executed.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
But who would've imagined

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,600
that his daughter is still alive.

198
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,000
She's hidden right in Penglai Village.

199
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,000
The Crown Prince's body

200
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,240
was also discovered in Penglai Village.

201
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
Isn't that a coincidence?

202
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,640
So you mean...

203
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,000
It seems I should
go meet this old acquaintance.

204
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,200
Consider it a way to clear my mind.

205
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,440
Aren't you very familiar
with Penglai Village?

206
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,160
Accompany me

207
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
on this trip.

208
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Yes.
