00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
(I'm Mai Tian.)

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,850
(My real name is Shen Zhinian.)

34
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,624
(My father was falsely accused
and convicted.)

35
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,160
(Shen Mansion, fifteen years ago)
(My entire family was involved.)

36
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:02,680
(Only my brother and I managed
to escape separately.)

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,440
Don't be afraid.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,080
(To reunite,)

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
(we made a pact)

40
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:09,088
(that we would meet at Hong Bridge
on the fifteenth lunar day.)

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
(Yet after over a decade,)

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,720
(my brother never appeared.)

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
(I have no other wishes.)

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,880
(I only pray for my brother's safety)

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,800
(and to see him once.)

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,430
(By Mai Tian.)

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
Nian, since the Shen family's tragedy,

48
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,680
it's been 15 years.

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Where on earth are you?

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,000
(I promise.)

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,920
(I'll protect you.)

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,360
Young master, we should head back.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,320
Have you gotten any news?

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,720
In all our imperial exams,
northern names only fill one in ten.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,520
Mr. Jin believes
something is suspicious.

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
He's had evidence.

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
He wants to see you.

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
Take me to see him.

59
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,840
Let's go.

60
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:41,471
(Penglai Village)

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,240
Mai Tian.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,280
Is this alright?

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
This flower is poisonous.

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
Only its roots are medicinal.

65
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,440
Why did you pick it?

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,880
Use your head, Mai Xiang.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
Sure, I did.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,472
Listen, I heard something
on my way here.

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
The emperor issued an edict

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,160
mandating unmarried men
and women over 20

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
to marry within this month.

72
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:05,800
Mai Tian, the magistrate
has long coveted you.

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
If you remain unmarried,

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,400
he'll force you to become his concubine.

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,600
The most urgent thing now

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,600
is to find a husband.

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,000
In this way,
you can get rid of the magistrate.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,400
Mai Tian.

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Why aren't you worried at all?

80
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't worry.

81
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,320
I won't let the magistrate succeed.

82
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,240
That's easy for you to say.

83
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
But if you don't get married

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,400
as ordered,

85
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
what will you do?

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,120
Perhaps,

87
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
the next moment,

88
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,400
my perfect husband

89
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,680
might suddenly appear

90
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
right before me.

91
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,760
Heavens!

92
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,064
Please grant me a perfect husband now!

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,720
Hey, look.

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
He looks fair-skinned.

95
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
Quite handsome, huh?

96
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,640
Be reserved.

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
Look,

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,840
he wears premium silk clothes.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,520
He must be from a noble family.

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
Weird.

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
How did he get so badly injured?

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,280
Who knows?

103
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,400
Judging by his injuries,

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
he must've been in a fight.

105
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
Then why bring him home?

106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,560
What if his enemies

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
come after him?

108
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I'll send him back.

109
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
If you carry him out now

110
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
and let neighbors see,

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,160
we couldn't possibly explain.

112
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
Forget it.

113
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,560
Then we'll wait for him to wake.

114
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,200
I'll head back to sleep.

115
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,120
What about him if you leave?

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
What about me?

117
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Father, I'll leave him to you.

118
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't go!

119
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,400

133
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
I don't know.

134
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,080
Let me go!

Father!

138
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
There is a foreign physician
at the palace.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,640
He said

140
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
wounds need to be disinfected
with high heat.

141
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Otherwise,

142
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,760
they're prone to festering.

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,840
Thank you

144
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,080
for treating my wound.

145
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,760
I was just stopping your bleeding.

146
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,280
Losing too much blood

147
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,960
will kill you.

148
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
Dying in your bed

149
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,400
is worth it.

150
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,520
Remember this pain.

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,160
You're not allowed to die.

152
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,680
His body wasn't found.

153
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,760
This isn't the outcome I wanted.

154
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,600
Remember,

155
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,680
don't leave any bloodstains.

156
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,416
What place is this?

157
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,400
Your Honor, it is Penglai Village.

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,280
(Penglai Village?)

159
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
He was already badly injured,

160
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,480
and you still hit him?

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,520
Now,

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,560
you've thoroughly offended him.

163
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,080
But he doesn't

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
seem to know

165
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,480
how he got hurt.

166
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
So I think

167
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
he must have lost his memory.

168
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,400
Even so,

169
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,840
you still shouldn't have hit him.

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
This bad man

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
suddenly showed up

172
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,320
while I was bathing?

173
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,800
Mai Tian.

174
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
Did he

175
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
see you naked?

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,280
Shut up!

177
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,640
No, he didn't.

178
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,640
He deserves

179
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
to be beaten.

180
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
If he wasn't injured,

181
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,720
I'd have knocked him out.

182
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,640
Enough!

183
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Both of you, behave, will you?

184
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,440
Just throw him

185
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,360
into the mountain.

186
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,280
I agree.

187
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,480
We must save him.

188
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,840
Go buy medicine right now!

189
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:50,880
Go!

190
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Okay.

191
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,720
(Jishi Pharmacy)
Thank you.

192
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,640
- Take care.
- Bye.

193
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
What's wrong?

194
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,800
You, Mai Tian,

195
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,880
have refused to get married,

196
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,600
defying the imperial decree.

197
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,480
I'll arrest you

198
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,000
and judge you.

199
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,200
Take her away!

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,040
Stop it!

201
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,680
Let me go!

202
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,040
Officials are bullying me!

203
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,160
Let me go!

204
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Mai Tian, do you intend
to defy the imperial decree?

205
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,440
Stop trying to pressure me!

206
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,880
I know you are

207
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,120
abusing your power for personal gain!

208
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,040
Outrageous!

209
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,080
Give her 20 strokes first!

210
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,240
Stop!

211
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,160
You were right.

212
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,800
I'm abusing my power for personal gain.

213
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,000
If you marry me

214
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,360
as my concubine,

215
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll spare you.

216
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
I can give you a good life.

217
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,400
You won't have to suffer then.

218
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,360
Pah!

219
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
You wish!

220
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,000
I'd rather die

221
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,640
than become your concubine!

222
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,640
Guards!

223
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,840
Beat her!

224
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Keep beating her!

225
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
Beat her until she agrees!

226
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,120
Yes.

227
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,400
Hold on.

228
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,360
I-I am

229
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,160
already engaged.

230
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,280
Really?

231
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,280
Who are you engaged to?

232
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,480
Well...

233
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,400
Don't try to fool me.

234
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
Where is your betrothed?

235
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,560
Make him appear

236
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,040
right before me now!

237
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:35,334
I...

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
