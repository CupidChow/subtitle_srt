00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,380
Can you help me with something?

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,500
I want to pursue my tutor.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,740
How to flirt with your tutor with a score of 100.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,820
And what is it that he can't do?

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,140
Being a delinquent like you.

00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,860
- I'm taking you to a fight.
- A fight?

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,700
- Let's go!
- Hey!

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,828
You want me to feed you. Right?

9
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,220
It'd be too romantic. My mom is also here.

10
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,220
When I do it well enough, you can give in to me.

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,700
Give me some time to win your heart. Okay?

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,860
Let's divide into groups, to join activities with the kids in the camp.

Let's divide into groups, to join activities with the kids in the camp.

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,180
What kind of activities?

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,240
Do you have a part in it?

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,260
Okay. Let's stand up and draw lots.

17
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,900
Hey, Thi. You go first.

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,360
Thi is in Group One!

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,580
Come on up and pick one.

20
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,880
Ray is in Group Three.

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,741
You're in Group One.

22
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:46,180
You're in Group Four.

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,061
Group Three.

24
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,300
Group Four.

25
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,380
Who hasn't picked one yet?

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,320
Thi is in Group One!

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,020
Oh, we ran out of lots?

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,700
Well, in that case,

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,280
I'll let you… set up a new group,

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,740
so your friends can be in your group too. What do you say?

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,020
Can't I just join Group One?

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,540
It's better to set up a new group,

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,730
so that we'll have more groups,

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,401
- and your friends can join the activities too.
- How many people do we need?

35
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,420
Well, around four to five people,

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,680
so all groups can be of the same size.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,700
Okay, so Noey is in Group Five, guys.

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Yay!

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,140
I couldn't be in the same group as him.

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,780
- All right.
- Le's start.

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,180
Hey!

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,340
I think we don't have to join the activities.

43
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,940
We have to fight the Watpae gang tomorrow.

44
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,920
We have to join!

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,160
Okay. Fine!

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,460
What about our group members, then?

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,320
How cool is this.

Then gather all kitchen supplies that can still be used.

167
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,760
That's the plan.

168
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,360
Let's go!

169
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,400
Damn.

170
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,960
Do you have a broom?

171
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,220
How about this one?

172
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,440
In case it rains…

173
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,420
Where did you go, Thi?

174
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,620
I went to check on Noey's group.

175
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,940
Is everything okay?

176
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,360
Yeah, all good.

177
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,840
What's up, our group leader?

178
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,540
You're slacking off?

179
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,960
What should we do after this?

180
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,080
We can organize the space into a library first.

181
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,720
Or we could find bookshelves from other rooms and place them here.

182
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,640
After we finish setting up, we can put some books on the shelves.

183
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,920
Yes, sir!

184
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,400
Okay, I'll go find more bookshelves in other classrooms.

185
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,360
Okay.

186
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,480
- I'll be back.
- Fighting.

187
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,520
Here's some water.

188
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,080
I'm so thirsty right now.

189
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,140
Took you long enough.

190
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,780
I came here as fast as I could.

191
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,881
I'll go get a gas tank.

192
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,560
I'll go and borrow pots, pans,

193
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,400
and cooking utensils from Auntie Tim's restaurant.

194
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,960
Well, then Beem can go and borrow plates, forks, and spoons from Watphlu temple.

195
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,720
Well, then Beem can go and borrow plates, forks, and spoons from Watphlu temple.

196
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,580
And what about you, Thiw?

197
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,680
I have to buy and prepare meat, vegetables, and seasonings.

198
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,640
What about you, Noey?

199
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,880
I'll be the cook!

200
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,400
Who else knows how to cook in this group?

201
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:38,240
They look delicious.

202
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,204
Who made all these?

203
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:41,663
Noey made scrambled eggs.

204
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,180
Hey, then I don't want eggs.

205
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,840
- I'm allergic.
- Allergic to eggs?

206
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,841
Allergic to eggs?

207
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,360
Yeah.

208
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,420
Thank you.

209
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,100
Thank you.

210
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,300
You have to eat a lot to have more energy.

211
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,940
Okay.

212
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,860
Hey, Tong, you're not eating scrambled eggs?

213
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,920
That's your favorite dish.

214
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,820
Hey, you can have some of mine. I have a lot.

215
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,840
Good luck to you guys.

216
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,440
About what?

217
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,340
I think you'll need some water.

218
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
I know who made this.

219
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,200
Why didn't you warn us?

220
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,820
Even if these are just eggs,

221
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,360
I made them especially for you.

222
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,600
All of his eggs are gone,

223
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,200
and they are in your basket.

224
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,080
Oh my god! Nice wordplay.

225
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,280
Who taught you that?

226
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,040
What do you think, Waew?

227
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,580
It's quite obvious.

228
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,900
Here you go.

229
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,900
All this good food and you guys are eating garbage.

230
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,660
Don't you have other friends?

231
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
I always see you with this guy.

232
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,000
Noey! Speak nicely to Phayu.

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,720
He's your senior.

234
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,220
In this area,

235
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,820
I don't even consider you as my senior, Thi,

236
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,120
because I'm going to make you my boyfriend.

237
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
So,

238
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,140
I don't care about anyone else.

239
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,500
I don't have time for others

240
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,720
because it's all yours.

241
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,640
Have you finished high school yet?

242
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,200
And how old are you?

243
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,660
Hey! Hey!

244
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,220
What does it have to do with you?

245
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,140
I was just asking.

246
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,800
That's enough, Noey.

247
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,920
We'll see.

248
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,880
Oh, there's nothing going on everyone. Well…

249
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,020
these two are just practicing their lines for a play.

250
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,800
Whoever believes that is an idiot.

251
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,000
What? Noey, you were just practicing your lines?

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,120
It seemed so real.

253
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,800
How about a fair fight then?

254
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,140
Fight with your brain.

255
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,960
This is a friendly match, guys.

256
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Let it all out in this field.

257
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,800
We still have to work together.

258
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,360
Go!

259
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,440
Give it your all. Go for it!

260
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,280
- Focus, focus.
- Beat him, Noey!

261
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,820
Yay!

262
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,580
He's no match for our boss.

263
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,440
Keep going.

264
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,340
Can you handle it?

265
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
Go, go. Yeah, nice!

266
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,280
Yay!

267
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,220
There you go. That's how it's done.

268
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,320
Awesome! He's great!

269
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,140
It's a tie? Woah!

270
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
Hey, take cover from the rain, guys!

271
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,140
It's raining. Come in.

272
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,660
Hurry, come in! Come in!

273
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,880
Over there, hurry up and come in.

274
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,460
- Hey, you should take cover.
- Let's go guys! Come on!

275
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,110
Phayu, go take cover first and continue the game later.

276
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,680
Come on, come on. Let's go.

277
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,820
You too, Noey. Come on.

278
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,300
Let's go, Thi.

279
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,500
Not only can you not swim but getting wet from the rain also make you sick?

280
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Stop complaining. I'm not sick.

281
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,820
You should have gotten out of the rain sooner.

282
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,700
You didn't even take cover.

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
Are you worried about me?

284
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm worried about you too,

285
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,140
more than anyone else right now.

286
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,940
And I'm possessive over you, too!

287
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,740
If I could lock you in my heart,

288
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,320
I would have done so already.

289
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,120
Do you even hear yourself talking, kid?

290
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,400
No, I can't let myself get carried away.

291
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,520
You keep looking into my eyes.

292
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,990
You're falling for me again?

293
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,320
Yeah.

294
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,520
Hey! It's not that!

295
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,000
What did I just say?

296
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,580
Let's just say that it was a good sign.

297
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,400
Thanks for being straight forward.

298
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,400
Noey, what is it?

299
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,260
You should get some rest. I can fill in for your duties.

300
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,000
No.

301
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,360
There's nothing wrong with me.

302
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,760
Woah.

303
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,620
What are you doing?

304
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,280
Wait here for a minute.

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,180
He never tells me where he's going, huh?

306
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,540
Just sleep for a bit.

307
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,660
Don't worry.

308
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,380
I won't destroy your camp,

309
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,580
a sleepyhead tutor who snores super loud.

310
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,960
What are you talking about?

311
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,320
You snored all night...

312
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,780
like this.

313
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,860
Three cubed…

314
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,500
He's really funny.

315
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,420
He must be hot.

316
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,580
Circles.

317
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,000
Intersect and union. I remember that one.

318
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,700
I don't remember that.

319
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,060
What would you know?

320
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,860
I held you in my arms all night and you didn't even know.

321
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,560
Really?

322
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,220
You did that for real?

323
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,340
I'm not confirming that.

324
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,890
Let's just leave it to last night.

325
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,790
♫ When your heart is filled with love, like a flying bird ♫

326
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,000
Watch it.

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,610
I'll smack you, Noey.

328
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:33,120
♫ You blew my heart away to an unknown place ♫

329
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,840
Come here. I'll help you change your clothes.

330
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,760
Huh?

331
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,240
Come on. Stand up!

332
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,420
What?

00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,880
but it took me so long

501
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,600
to get to know this place.

502
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,360
I wanted to do something to make it a better place.

503
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,460
These are the reasons.

504
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,540
That was pretty long, but quite touching. Cheers, everyone!

505
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,680
That was pretty long, but quite touching. Cheers, everyone!

506
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,950
Cheers to Jarunee!

507
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,260
Cheers!

508
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,600
Tong!

509
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,280
Who is this Jarunee?

510
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,381
I don't know.

511
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:36,940
I saw it as the library name.

512
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,340
But that's all right.

513
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,350
To all the volunteer camp members.

514
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,700
Cheers!

515
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,610
To the music club who plays music for us. Cheers!

516
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,080
To the music club who plays music for us. Cheers!

517
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,870
To everyone who came and those who didn't.

518
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,760
Cheers!

519
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,260
To the tents, guitars, and motorcycles.

520
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,560
To everyone in this field and even the basketballs.

521
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,580
Cheers!

522
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,700
And for our dinner today,

523
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,540
we have a special surprise

524
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,940
from the most delicious and famous kitchen in this neighborhood.

525
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,640
Please welcome Auntie Tim!

526
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,040
- Yay!
- I'm here. I'm here!

527
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,140
I was waiting to see if he would cheer forsomething else.

528
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,170
Right? Cheers to this and that.

529
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,000
I've been waiting at the back of my truck.

530
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,261
So that means… we don't have to eat salty food anymore!

531
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:31,840
- Yay!
- Huray!

532
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,300
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that Noey was in charge of cooking in this camp.

533
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,300
Goodness. Everyone will get to enjoy some good food soon. Okay?

534
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,520
We'll have dinner soon.

535
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,700
Come serve yourselves, guys.

536
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,620
Hey, guys! Don't forget to get yourself some Krati Ice cream, too.

537
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,240
Complimentary from Noey Watphlu!

538
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Give me a ladle.

539
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,420
Want to go eat?

540
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,980
It's good. Not salty. I made it myself, not Noey.

541
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,460
Your volunteer camp went well.

542
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,680
Good job, Thi.

543
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,460
You did good.

544
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,220
I gave you 100 out of 100.

545
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,740
Thank you…

546
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,520
for being obedient.

547
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,300
And if I was naughty, what would you do?

548
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,380
I'll smack you.

549
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,960
You want to try me?

550
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,180
Hey, Beem.

551
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,980
You can't just hurt the Watphlu gang leader.

552
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,900
What do you think of our boss's image?

553
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,700
Who'll be afraid of our gang from now on?

554
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,300
You are my underling.

555
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,040
Did you forget about that?

556
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,020
I have no clue.

557
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,200
Do you ever know anything?

558
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,440
I'm not afraid of you. I'm ready to fight!

559
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,300
Just because I've been gentle and sweet with you lately,

560
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,800
you forgot how ruthless I am?

561
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
Geez.

562
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,400
Nonsense.

563
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,580
Or do you prefer the old bad boy attitude? Which one do you like?

564
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,800
Huh? Jarunee?

565
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,500
Meow.

566
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,160
What?

567
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,240
Want to go eat?

568
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,020
- Let's go.
- Or would you rather eat my cooking?

569
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,990
You like it. Right? My scrambled eggs.

570
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,880
Let's have some ice cream.

571
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,720
Do you want to play football?

572
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,880
What?

573
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,480
Some more water?

574
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,630
Everything went well.

575
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,900
Jarunee is very happy.

576
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,180
Cheers!

577
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,120
I just realized the true meaning of eating this ice cream.

578
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,600
I had Krati Ice cream before and it was…

579
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,120
quite good.

580
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,660
But eating Krati Ice cream with you right now, Thi,

581
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,840
is so blissful.

582
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,680
I see… eating Krati Ice cream with Thi.

583
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,220
You meant eating it with me. Right?

584
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,980
You are pretty clever after all.

585
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,160
No wonder you can tame me.

586
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,380
I finished my ice cream…

587
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,980
Can I have you next?

588
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
Don't. Stop playing around.

589
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,400
I don't play around. I'm serious.

590
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,140
I thought you said this was for your mom.

591
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,580
Noey has changed. Right?

592
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,940
Well, it's because of Thi's influence.

593
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,560
Otherwise, he'd be just like his father.

594
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,520
Hey! Turn around and pay attention!

595
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,000
Stop staring at your feet!

596
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
Well, it's okay.

597
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,141
He won't do anything to you.

598
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:31,000
You get into a fight every day. What's wrong with you?

599
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,160
You're in eleventh grade now.

600
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,480
This is just a small wound. It won't hurt.

601
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,940
It does! Ouch.

602
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,520
I really want to go to the temple fair.

603
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,240
Be patient with me.

604
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,600
I will become a better person for you.

605
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,640
I will be the person you can proudly walk with when we go out.

606
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,260
Noey! We got some troubles behind the temple.

607
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,720
Bas came all the way here to insult us!

608
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
I just took care of your friends. Now there's only you left. Just as I thought, you chicken out.

609
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,240
I just took care of your friends. Now there's only you left. Just as I thought, you chicken out.

610
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,340
You have to promise me that you will quit acting like a delinquent,

611
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,300
and focus on your studies for your mom and your sister.

612
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,060
I think you're way too serious, man.

613
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,060
From now on, everyone has to focus on studying and submitting their homework.

614
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,560
If your score is lower than mine, watch out.
