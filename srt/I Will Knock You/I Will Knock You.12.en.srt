00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,880
Not anymore.

166
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,000
Where have you been, Noey?

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,090
It took you this long to come

168
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,180
and clear things up with me, huh?

169
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,300
Hey, everyone!

170
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,240
Watphlu gang is coming back stronger than ever!

171
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
Hey!

172
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,060
Noey.

173
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,100
I think you still have some unfinished business.

174
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,900
Watphlu gang is still incomplete.

175
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,340
Go get one of us back.

176
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,980
How to flirt with your tutor and get 100 points.

177
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,120
Number one, act dumb and let him tutor you.

178
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,680
Ten points.

179
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,280
Number two, help him with something he cannot do.

180
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,440
Took him to fight a rival gang. Ten points.

181
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,700
Number three, always be by his side.

182
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,580
Ten points from dropping me off today.

183
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,620
Number four, treat him to desserts.

184
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,940
Ten points for buying me ice cream.

185
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,580
It was delicious.

186
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,980
Number five, take him out on a trip to relax. The Temple Fair.

187
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,380
How many points would you give me today, out of ten?

188
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,100
- Nine.
- How come I got only nine?

189
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,840
Nine points plus one point.

190
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,780
Did you cheat to get that one point for me?

191
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,940
Number nine, get rid of love rivals. Ten points.

192
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,500
I gave you ten points because there was no one to get rid of.

193
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,720
This is unethical.

194
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,700
Number ten,

195
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,340
I have to win over his family. Ten points.

196
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,080
I gave you ten points in advance because I'm sure you can do it.

197
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:58,680
Thiwa, your homeroom teacher.

198
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,740
You didn't know that he came to see me. Right?

199
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,220
He came to tell me about you.

200
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,540
I never thought it would be like this.

201
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,440
Noey never intended to leave you and the Watphlu gang

202
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,180
because Watphlu gang means so much to him.

203
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,860
It's because of me.

204
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,220
I made him promise to stop being a delinquent.

205
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,880
That's why Noey didn't show up at Watphlu that night.

206
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,900
Do you know what time it is?

207
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,700
I'll call you back. I'm watching a movie.

208
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Huh? What did you just say?

209
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,620
Be quiet, please, Noey.

210
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,220
He explained everything to me on your behalf.

211
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,380
But I wanted you to come and explain it yourself.

212
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,680
Oh and did you open the box that Thi's friend gave you yet?

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,260
Please give this to Noey.

Just go. Hurry and go now, before the semester starts.

Then I'll go tomorrow. Okay?

Oh… you're too kind, Auntie Tim.

Well, your heart is not here, so I have to let you go.

Yeah, yeah. I told you to fly there, but you're too stubborn.

- Thank you.

- I'll take good care of Noey, Auntie Tim.

- Good. Go ahead.
- Keep us posted.

Go, go. I'll follow you there.

241
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,940
We're almost at Nakhon Sawan. Where to next?

242
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,660
Before entering Nakhon Sawan city,

243
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,300
you need to take a bypass to Kamphaeng Phet.

244
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,660
Stay on the left side. There should be a sign.

00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,240
Okay, noted.

246

Let's just keep going. Only a few more kilos.

250
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,700
Hey, I think we should rest first.

251
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,820
We can keep going tomorrow morning.

252
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,460
I really want to see him now. Come on, let's go.

It's almost 1:00 a.m. now. We should get some rest.

255
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,550
Just a bit more.

256
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm this close to seeing his face.

257
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,480
We've come this far.

258

259

We'll leave first thing in the morning.

- Hello there.

261
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,700
Noey.

262
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,520
Take it.

263
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,540
It's for you.

264
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,540
You can keep it...

265
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,360
as a symbol of my heart.

266
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,640
Take it.

267
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,220
His feelings are sincere.

268
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,560
Noey, let go of me!

269
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,800
Let go of me already.

270
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
I don't want anymore of this.

271
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,950
I'm not someone you can mess around with.

272
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,860
Let me go!

273
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,940
I can't handle this anymore.

274
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm not letting you go.

275
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,820
I will never let you go again.

276
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,760
Enough already.

277
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,500
Just go back and be with your real female lead.

278

00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,420
Just go back.

280
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,480
Can I at least stay with you for a while?

281
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,740
Okay?

282
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,220
Just tell him that his dad told you to say that!

283
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,120
It's because of your mom and dad.

284
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,560
They called Auntie Tim and talked to Noey.

285
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,580
Is it true?

286

"If you have good intentions towards him,

287
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,260
then you should let him go for his sake,

288
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,600
not holding him back like this.

289
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,620
This means you just love yourself, not Thi."

290
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,680
"Let go of him, Noey."

291
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,800
Your dad broke his heart like this.

292
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,660
He had to use Pam as an excuse, so that you could get over him.

293
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,500
That's enough, Thiw.

294
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,160
I'm the leading man. I'm willing to get hurt,

295
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,340
give up, and let you go,

296
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,020
if that makes you happier.

297
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,000
It was not because of your mom and dad.

298
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,840
It was because of me.

299
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,760
I just want what's best for you.

300
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,480
I have no future…

301

What they said is true.

302
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,940
But before I die from heartache,

303
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,760
I wanted to see you one more time.

304
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,720

And again.

308

And again and again and again and again.

309
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,110
I couldn't just let you go like your parents asked me to.

310
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,700
Can you give me more time to get over you?

311
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,400
I can't handle this much pain.

312
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,630

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,700
This is my policy, Thi.

329
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,900
♫ As for me, I only look at the moon ♫

330
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,920
And the story ends happily ever after.

331
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,200
The leading man gets to be with his love til death do they part.

332
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,660
Thiw! Thiw!

333
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,180
Stop zoning out. Come and help me.

334
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,700
Sorry, man. I was too into it.

335
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,380
Sorry, sorry.

336
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,080
- So… where are we going?
- Sightseeing.

337
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,200
We're going to go sightseeing?

338
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,800
This is our first time here.

339
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,620
Should we go rumble with other gangs?

340
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,340
Make it known and make them terrified of Watphlu.

341
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,140
Let's do this!

342
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,340
Wait a minute.

343
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,280
You're going go fight with someone?

344
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,240
Oh, nothing.

345
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,280
We quit fighting. No more of that.

346
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,540
You're going to cause trouble here, too?

347
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,760
Not at all.

348
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,540
Seriously, I'm still wondering.

349
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,760
What did you get from gang fights?

350
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,500
It's just something silly good-for-nothing people do.

351
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,540
A good kid like you wouldn't understand.

352
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,020
That's our Watphlu boss!

353
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,200
Let's go!

354
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,320
Yeah, let's go fight!

355
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,920
- Hey!
- I mean let's go sightseeing.

356
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,100
Sightseeing.

357
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,101
Come on, Thi. Get over here.

358
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:51,600
- Where can I put this?
- Oh, that's mine.

359
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,140
- Okay.
- Let's go.

360
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,060
- You take the lead.
- Okay.

361
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,061
You know where to go?

362
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,363
Where should we go? Where do you want to go?

363
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:02,023
Thi, any recommendations?

364
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,160
Wow!

365
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,740
You really put in a lot of effort, riding all the way from Bangkok.

366
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,600
Chiangmai is not far at all.

367
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,140
I can even come here every day.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,880
I can pick you up and drop you off at the university.

369
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,540
Easy-peasy.

370
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,120
All right… my cocky kid.

371
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
I'm always yours.

372
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,560
What was that?

373
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,120
Come on.

374
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,840
If you don't know what to do, you can ask me.

375
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,860
I go on a pilgrimage with monks quite often.

376
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,700
Find the corners first. This is the base.

377
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,060
You know what you're doing. Right?

378
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,800
Hey, I went on a pilgrimage with Thiw, too.

379
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,840
When I was a kid, people always paid respect to me.

380
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
Because you're respectable?

381
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,700
No, I was a novice monk.

382
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,720
Oh, the wind.

383
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,661
- Come on. Let's finish it.
- Okay.

384
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:02,220
We've done this so many times already.

385
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,640
It's because of the wind.

386
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,760
Here. This one…

387
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
Which one is it?

388
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,480
Should we just lay down and use it as a blanket?

389
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,543
- Good idea.
- Hey, we can't do that.

390
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,920
Do you believe in destiny now?

391
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,460
Well…

392
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,760
I can start to believe in it.

393
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Why not?

394
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,140
I don't know.

395
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,840
It seems like… nonsense.

396
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,440
Huh?

397
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,740
That's the same answer as before.

398
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,560
But… you're also nonsense. Right?

399
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm going to believe in it… because of you.

400
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,760
Because I met you.

401
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,440
Can we continue our lesson about Thi?

402
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,340
Let's start right now.

403
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,280
A special course…

404
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,260
that you want to teach and I want to study.

405
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:30,010
♫ I still secretly hope he's interested ♫

406
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,500
Hey! Come eat BBQ! It's ready now!

407
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,000
Come on! I'm ready. Hurry up!

408
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,300
I guess we'll have to wait until I'm older.

409
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,860
Yeah.

410
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,200
I guess so.

411
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,600
Do you believe in a first kiss?

412
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,820
Not yet.

413
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,780
Because I've never had one.

414
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,860
You're right.

415
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,780
If you don't count that one time at the volunteer camp

416
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,640
that you were fast asleep and snoring…

417
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,860
You secretly kissed me?

418
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,360
I don't know.

419
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,160
Hey!

420
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,560
Are you teasing me?

421
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,980
The past is the past.

422
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,500
I'm older than you, Noey.

423
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,480
I don't know. I don't know.

424
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,820
Let's go eat BBQ.

425
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,120
Let's eat BBQ.

426
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,460
You always dodge the question.

427
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,000
- Thiw!
- Come on.

428
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm coming.

429
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,340
- Hurry up.
- What were you doing?

430
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,940
- Huh?
- What were you doing?

431
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,580
Just talking.

432
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,260
I was just teasing him.

433
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,820
Who would do anything in a temple, in the forest, on a mountain, right?

434
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,220
- I'm glad you have common sense.
- Amen.

435
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,560
[I'm very glad to visit your hometown, Thi]

436
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,300
You're finally here, Tim!

437
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,300
Hey!

438
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,260
That one looks exactly like yours.

439
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Right.

440
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,200
That's because I bought it here.

441
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,580
The House Next to the Temple.

442
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,180
My house is also right next to the temple.

443
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,800
Hey! Well, yeah, that's true.

444
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,300
Physically we are far apart…

445
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,100
and yet we feel more connected,

446
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,620
even with this shoulder bag.

447
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,640
You're so good at blabbing, Noey.

448
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,430
Hey, where's the pendant shop?

449
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,380
Oh, over there, Auntie Tim.

450
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm going to buy myself one because Noey won't let me have this one.

451
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,720
- Oh, you're walking ahead?
- Wait for me.

452
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
- Nid Nhoi.
- I'll take you there.

453
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,060
It's this place, Auntie Tim.

454
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,780
Really?

455
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,760
Woah, where is it?

456
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,920
Oh, here it is!

457
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,800
This one is good for business.

458
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,260
This one. This one is a lucky charm for business.

459
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,620
How many do you want?

460
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,740
If you don't want it, I'll have it. Okay?

461
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,460
Oh, this one is a charm for soulmates, Nid Nhoi!

462
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,900
Hey!

463
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,700
This looks just like the one Noey gave to me and then took it back.

464
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,740
Don't tell me…

465
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,740
The pendant you gave me is a love charm?

466
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,600
Just take it then.

467
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,620
- No wonder we ended up together.
- Huh?

468
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,760
Wait, wait, wait.

469
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,960
I confirm that it's authentic.

470
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,020
Because I fell head over heels for you.

471
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,960
Like there was some sort of spell.

472
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,100
Like this is my last love.

473
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,040
Nid Nhoi.

474
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,940
Nid Nhoi, do you want one?

475
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,660
Do you have a boyfriend?

476
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,300
What are you talking about, Mom?

477
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm in no rush.

478
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,300
Geez, I'm just teasing you. Don't take it so seriously.

479
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,800
You should get me a charm that'll help with my studies.

480
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,340
We should hang that one around your brother's neck,

481
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,220
so that he can get into university.

482
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,080
You need to share your intelligence with your brother.

483
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,540
Hey, Auntie Tim.

484
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,020
I was minding my own business but you keep insulting me.

485
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,800
Oh my god! Who would dare insult Noey Watphlu?

486
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
You already have a great tutor.

487
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,660
I wouldn't dare insult you.

488
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,000
You should be smarter by now.

489
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,820
Hey!

490
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,920
Here you go.

491
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,920
Nice one.

492

Let me know when you get there.

495
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,500
Of course. You will be the first and only one I tell.

496

There's nobody else to tell.

Please send my mom and Nid Nhoi off on their spaceship. Okay?

So… focus on your studies. Okay?

510

After high school, I will definitely get into university.

Well, let's go. Let's go back.

520
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,280
You'd better worry about yourself.

Yeah, just worry about yourself.

522

- Sure, Auntie Tim.
- Yeah.

Follow the Lamphun sign first, Noey.

525
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,140
After that, it's Lampang and then Tak.

526
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,480
But if you see a Nakhon Sawan sign, just keep following that sign all the way.

527
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,300
Can you remember all of that, Noey?

528

Yeah.

When his dad was in Watphlu gang, he was a loan shark.

It's the capital.

Noey just wants the capital back.

And if the borrower can't pay back sometimes, that's okay!

We just take it from the capital.

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,880
One cup of ice cream, please.

656
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,560
Oh, I'm here to collect the interest.

657
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,800
Do you have it, Uncle?

658
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,120
I don't have money right now. I'll pay later.

659
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,540
You can't pay us? Then I'll have three cups of ice cream.

660
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,320
What's wrong with the bike?

661
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,560
Damn, we're already late.

662
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,880
It would be better to go by myself.

663
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,040
If you're going to complain, then why did you ask me to pick you up?

664
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,200
Too fast!

665
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,760
Hello, Thi, the graduate.

666
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,540
Hello, sophomore Noey.

667
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,920
When did Noey remove all of his tattoos?

668
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,800
Noey has never had any tattoos.

669
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,200
Huh?

670
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,780
An important day with important people for Noey.

671
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,440
One, two, three.

672
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,360
Take more just in case.

673
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,420
One, two, three.

674
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,800
- Mommy Tim.
- What?

675
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,840
Thank you very much.

676
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,860
Thank you for pushing me until I graduated, Thi.

677
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,000
I was already ordained for mom.

678
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,460
When did you do that?

679
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,320
Now there's only you left.

680
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,920
Huh?

681
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,660
Don't tell me?

682
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,520
What's this?

683
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,480
It's a betel bowl procession.

684
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,380
Huh?

685
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,300
Now that I have graduated,

686
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,320
I might as well ask you to marry me.

687
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,720
final credits

688
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,710
Channel Manager: tile

689
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,800
Number thirteen, marry him.

690
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,500
The most important one.

691
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,540
Thanks to our amazing CE: kakashiandme

692
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,540
Thanks to our bjohnsonwong (CS) and his team of segmenters.

693
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,540
Thanks to the moderators of the other languages and thanks to you for following along!
Until the next project!

694
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,840
The end. I hope everyone's happy.

695
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:02,600
Hold on a moment.

696
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,444
Hey!

697
00:47:03,444 --> 00:47:07,483
There's one thing I forgot to tell you.

698
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:14,820
Your heart…

699
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,380
has been with me for a long time now.
