00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,580
Hey, are you free today? Have you eaten anything yet?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,180
See? I told you. There's really a restaurant in here.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,560
That is the legendary Auntie Tim.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,540
I have to go get my iPad in the car.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,940
I need to send a file to my student.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,300
My eyes hurt. Move!

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,000
- Noey.
- Wait! Wait!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,740
Woah! Help me, please!

9
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,616
Hold my hand. It's you again?

10
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:20,101
- Are you a tutor?
- Yes.

11
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,660
I want you to teach my kid.

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,761
You're welcome.

13
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:25,940
Is your heart really calling for me?

14
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,460
Do you think helping me will impress me and give in?

15
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,140
Hurry up!

16
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,820
Walk quickly then. It'll rain again soon.

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,920
Why did you bring me here?

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,080
For treatment, Wanlapa.

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,640
What? Treatment?

It's…

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,280
It should be a sin.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,560
It's not a sin. I already asked.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,020
But this is for monks.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,620
Hold this.

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,600
No way.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,940

No!

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,760
On my eyebrow.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,660
Oh…

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,300

- All of this?
- Wait…

171
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,580
Here you go. Eat it.

172
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,520
Want me to feed you?

173
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,381
- All right.
- I can eat by myself.

174
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:06,200
Just hurry and eat.

175
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,440
Here, to make it a bit sweet.

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,500
Orange juice.

177
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,640
Eat up.

178
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,340
Don't forget about dessert.

179
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,720
This one is good. I tried it yesterday.

180
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,180
Do you want some?

181
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,760
Here, I'm giving you my egg.

182
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,040
There is only some left. Just eat it.

183
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,400
Thank you.

184
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:48,470
♫ I was never interested in anyone, nor cared about others ♫

185
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:55,430
♫ My heart is the same, it has never been cared for ♫

186
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,260
♫ I used to be a person who didn't listen... ♫

187
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,310
Are you still looking at me?

188
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:09,860
♫ Until one day you broke into my heart ♫

189
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,560
[Wat Phlu]

190
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,920
Can you imagine what I have been through?

191
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,460
This is like what my mom offers to the monks in the morning.

192
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,260
Just eat it.

193
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,560
You guys aren't paying attention to what I've been through at all?

194
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,300
I had to sleep and eat at the temple!

195
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,620
You people...

196
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,600
You guys are so mean.

197
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,860
I still have stomach pain.

198
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,340
They kicked me real hard.

199
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,860
He was kicked, too!

200
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,180
Woah!

201
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,020
You, hurry up.

202
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,740
Hurry up and take me to the doctor.

203
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,520
Hey, what about a volunteer camp this year?

204
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,480
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- Woah.

205
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,680
Why are you asking now?

206
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,760
It just came into my mind. What should I do?

207
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,460
I don't know!

208
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,240
I want to take a shower!

209
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,680
I have no idea now.

210
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,980
Noey! That girl is looking at you.

211
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,820
She is looking at you or me?

212
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,420
Thiw…

213
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,680
I think we should tell them to go.

214
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,900
Why?

215
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,000
We should be prepared, in case we get into a fight.

216
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,940
We were born for this, dude!

217
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,020
I came here to wait for Pam,

218
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,980
not to pick a fight with someone.

219
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,900
What if Pam humiliates you again?

220
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,440
Then I can take care of it.

221
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,420
Geez, I am just kidding.

222
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,380
Sure, I'll handle it.

223
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,500
Whatever you say.

224
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,780
Noey Watphlu!

225
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,520
Hey! Let's go back. Come on!

226
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,180
Just go away!

227
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,440
Goodbye, Noey.

228
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
When will she come?

229
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,380
Hey, that's really Noey Watphlu!

230
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,400
I want to take a photo with him.

231
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,160
Are you crazy? Aren't you afraid of him?

232
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,840
He is scary, but I like him.

233
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,760
Hey! You like him?

234
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,640
Want to take a photo? I'll take it for you.

235
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,880
Come, come. Don't be afraid.

236
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,580
Noey Watphlu treats a lady well.

237
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,860
Hey, don't touch him! Or he will kick you.

238
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,500
You just said he treats a lady well!

239
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,720
Only the one he likes.

240
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,200
Come on.

241
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,940
Smile.

242
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,540
One, two.

243
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,340
Hey you.

244
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,260
Are you in tenth grade?

245
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,800
I am looking for Pam.

246
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,620
We are waiting for her. Do you know her?

247
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,080
We are in eleventh grade.

248
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,940
Eleventh grade?

249
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,820
Okay, if you want to know Noey, you can contact me.

250
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,640
I am his personal manager.

251
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,680
How does the photo look?

252
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,020
Hey, you'll be fine by yourself. Right? I'll wait outside.

253
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,080
Okay, sure.

254
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,760
Let me fix you up.

255
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,981
- Do I look okay now?
- Yeah.

256
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:33,240
- This looks cool enough?
- Yeah.
- Okay.

257
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,220
Don't destroy Noey Watphlu's reputation!

258
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,920
Do you understand?

259
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,900
Sure, thank you very much.

260
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,440
- I have to go now. See you.
- All right, see you.

261
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,120
My boss is so cool!

262
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,580
Wow!

263
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,200
Okay.

264
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,180
Why don't you sit with your friends?

265
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,060
I'm fine.

266
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,840
What's wrong?

267
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,000
Two more cards. Need to pick two more?

268
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,480
Okay.

269
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
No. It's nothing.

270
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,100
We still have time before class.

271
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,000
Have you eaten anything yet? It's my treat.

272
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,340
Let's go!

273
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,800
15 minutes left.

274
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,340
Right. Is Noey still bothering you lately?

275
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,080
No.

276
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,240
That's good.

277
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,920
He kept his promise.

278
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,800
That's very nice of him.

279
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,220
I thought a gangster like him would be nothing but trouble.

280
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,420
You must be careful.

281
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,100
I think he's scary.

282
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, I think so.

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
But...

284
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Sometimes he doesn't seem so scary.

285
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,780
You can't take your eyes off my handsome face, can you?

286
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,360
Wanlapa.

287
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,400
Are you still looking at me?

288
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
Do you think I will be nice like last night?

289
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,180
But he's scary anyway.

290
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,360
He's unpredictable.

291
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,660
Do you know his background?

292
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,920
- Background?
- Yes.

293
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,600
He even has a notorious background?

294
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,360
Yes, he does.

295
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,660
Can you tell me about him?

296
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,700
Noey, his name is Noey,

297
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,420
known as Noey Watphlu.

298
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,960
I think I knew that already.

299
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Okay. Let's continue.

300
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,960
His background started when he was in high school.

301
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,000
Even if he is a sophomore, no one in Watphlu High School

302
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,560
dares to face him.

303
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,600
Everyone is scared of Noey.

304
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,200
Many girls are scared of him, but still like him anyway.

305
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,880
They're into bad boys, I guess.

306
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,280
But almost every guy doesn't want to be around him,

307
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,520
or even make eye contact with him.

308
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,200
Wow.

309
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,180
Really?

310
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,440
Hey! Are you done?

311
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,920
My boss wants to use the toilet.

312
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,440
Hey, come on out!

313
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,760
So slow!

314
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,520
Why do you have lunch in the toilet?

315
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,120
The toilet is available now.

316
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,760
No one gave him a warning?

317
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,920
Like teachers… What did they do?

318
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,680
They should give him a warning right?

319
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,641
No.

320
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:30,760
Paper.

321
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,680
Paper? Oh, tissue paper!

322
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,720
Yes.

323
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Hey, find him some tissue paper.

324
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,081
- Did you find it?
- No.

325
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:42,400
Take off your shirt then.

326
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
You got it yet?

327
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
Please wait for a moment.

328
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,720
Here, boss. Here you go.

329
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,400
Give me one more.

330
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,760
- One more?
- Yes.

331
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,920
Hey, you!

332
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,880
Take it off. Come and help.

333
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,601
They said Noey has connections.

334
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,440
- His father is very influential in this area.
- Here you are.

335
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,460
He donated a lot of money to the school.

336
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,000
Some of his friends are an abbot and a school director.

337
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,560
So no one dares to offend Noey.

338
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,760
Woah! Really?

339
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
It's like this Watphlu High Schoolis owned by Noey's gang.

340
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,600
That's too much.

341
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,100
Noey.

342
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,560
Hey, Sompong!

343
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,360
Have you finished copying for Noey?

344
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,240
I am trying to finish it now.

345
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,600
Why you are so slow?

346
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,080
Hurry up!

347
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
- Have you finished?
- It's almost done now.

348
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,440
I told you.

349
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,160
I won't help you if his homework can't be submitted on time.

350
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,480
How much longer?

351
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,200
Hurry up!

352
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,280
I am trying my best now.

353
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,600
Hey, don't take off his glasses. He needs them to copy the homework.

354
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,160
Someone said Noey was in prison once.

355
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,520
Really? With this age?

356
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,240
In the past, they always got into gunfights.

357
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,240
They always carried guns and other weapons with them.

358
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,240
He also has scary tattoos, and incantation tattoos all over his back.

359
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,080
I think he got it when he was in jail.

360
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,800
That's why I'm warning you that Noey is scary.

361
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,040
We should avoid him. Stay away from him.

362
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
After that day,

363
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
did they do anything to you?

364
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,320
I am so concerned about you.

365
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,120
No… I don't see them anymore.

366
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,280
Thank you for helping me... and Pam.

367
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,160
There's a high chance that Noey and his gang will be displeased,

368
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,520
- and will shoot you.
- Huh?

369
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,800
Well, It's okay. My pleasure.

370
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,120
As someone older, I have to help you.

371
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,480
What about their styles?

372
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,680
I think they were influenced by his father's first gang.

373
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,760
Around 80s or 90s.

374
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,680
You sure know a lot!

375
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,840
Why does Noey pursue Pam?

376
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,840
I think because Pam is cute.

377
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,200
Keep it for me, please.

378
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,160
Hello, Thi.

379
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,760
Hello.

380
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,040
Did you finish your homework?

381
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,960
The one I gave you.

382
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,240
- That's a bad habit.
- You will be in trouble.

383
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,300
You didn't do your homework.

384
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,940
It's not like you're here to pick me up.

385
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,880
Have you ever come to pick me up at the right school?

386
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,760
Geez, come on, sis!

387
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,560
The schools are just next to each other.

388
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,260
Like, this close.

389
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,020
You are waiting for Pam again?

390
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,560
Yes.

391
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:49,378
Is that from Mom?

392
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,320
Nope. I cooked it by myself.

393
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,600
But I confirm that my cooking is as delicious as Mom's.

394
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,080
I hope... Pam will like it.

395
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,480
Or do you want to go home now?

396
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,600
You should think first before you make a move,

397
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,280
thinking that if you move, you'll lose your chess piece or not.

398
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,240
No, Nid Nhoi. I already tried my best.

399
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,120
If this is the best you can do, then...

400
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,880
Then what?

401
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,000
That means you didn't think.

402
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,680
There is no way I'd call my brother 'stupid.'

403
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,400
No, not stupid.

404
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,920
The game is not over yet, Nid Nhoi.

405
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,880
Look, Nid Nhoi. Look.

406
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,760
That's all for today.

407
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,960
Goodbye, Thi.

Goodbye, Thi.

No, I want to go home now.

Just a second.

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,120
Wait for a moment, please.

I won't be long.

Stop complaining.

They always carried guns and other weapons with them.

Nid Nhoi, get over here!

437

I understand that girls like bad boys.

438
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,680
But bad boys should not hurt women.

439
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,960
When did I hurt you?

440
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,860
I don't know either.

441

I knew everything about you, Noey.

Don't threaten her. Just let her go.

She is still young.

Her mother is waiting for her to get home. She must be worried sick now.

I told you to go home. Mom is waiting for us.

Yeah, you're right.

Should we go back and have dinner with Mom?

That's a good idea. This was too salty for me.

00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:14,740
Help me, please!

505
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,020
Oh, okay.

506
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,580
Help me, please!

507
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,680
Help me, please!

508
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,820
I can't do it anymore.

509
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,340
No one wants to help me shout?

510
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,460
Do you have some water?

511
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,120
You guys have food, but no water?

512
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,200
Anyone, help please.

513
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,740
I don't want to be stuck here.

514
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,440
I am thirsty.

515
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,480
There's no water.

516
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,220
Someone can eat the food you cooked.

517
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,960
Nid Nhoi, do you want some?

518
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,700
It's delicious.

519
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,520
You can have it. I am not hungry.

520
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,150
Steamed Layer Cake.

521
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,720
Wow, delicious!

522
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,260
You want some?

523
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,500
Orange...

524
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,040
So sweet.

525
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,460
What?

526
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,640
Yesterday, I slept at the temple.

527
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,320
Today, I slept on the school's rooftop.

528
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,300
Those guys left without telling me. Didn't even call me!

529
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,370
Noey Watphlu.

530
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:37,580
Every time we meet, I am always in trouble!

531
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,000
Hello, Auntie Tim.

532
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,840
Hello, you called me yesterday. Do you have something to talk to me about?

533
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,140
Oh, are you coming in to teach my kid this evening?

534
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,740
Yes, I will go for the class today.

535
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,180
Yesterday, I had a little trouble.

536
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,460
- Nid Nhoi?
- It's about Nid Nhoi.

537
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:11,320
Yesterday evening, I saw Nid Nhoi with...

538
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,460
With…?

539
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,060
With…

540
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,240
A male student.

541
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,380
Oh, with her friend?

542
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,300
She has many male friends. It's normal.

543
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,810
No. I think he is older...

544
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,680
And I think we can't trust him.

545
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,760
So I followed her because I was worried.

546
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,320
That's why today she got home in the early morning.

547
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,820
- Morning?
- Yes.

548
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,540
- And what's it about?
- You must have been worried sick.

549
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,120
And did you report this to the police?

550
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,900
Wait, Nid Nhoi didn't get home in the morning.

551
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,980
She got home last night with her older brother.

552
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,420
It was around 9:00-10:00 p.m.

553
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,340
- What?
- Yes.

554
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,960
Let's talk more this evening. I have errands to run.

555
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,880
Goodbye.

556
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,980
They got home around 9:00-10:00 p.m?

557
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,640
Noey was the only one who insisted that the door was locked.

558
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,900
No one wants to help me shout?

559
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,300
And didn't even try to ask for help.

560
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,180
And it is possible that…

561
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,060
The door wasn't locked in the first place.

562
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,240
How could you have done this to me?

563
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,560
I am angry now!

564
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,040
Here! Take it!

565
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,000
Noey Watphlu.

566
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,240
Take it!

567
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,740
I'm not sure now...

568
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,240
That the one I have to teach...

569
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,120
is Nid Nhoi or not.

570
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,060
Well… I will know it today.

571
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,961
Thi.

572
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,300
- Hello, Auntie Tim.
- Hello.

573
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,580
I will take you upstairs. Let's go.

574
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,260
Today, you will be able to teach for sure.

575
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,640
I locked my kid in the room. That kid can't go anywhere.

576
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,040
Follow me.

577
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,420
The historic moment is soon to come.

578
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,420
Come here.

579
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
This room.

580
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,180
You can get in. The door is not locked.

581
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,300
Please wait.

582
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,440
How many kids do you have?

583
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,840
Two.

584
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,080
She got home last night

585
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,080
With her older brother.

586
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,730
Just go in.

587
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,260
She has two kids.

588
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,000
Please don't turn out the way I'm thinking.

589
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,540
Is that Nid Nhoi's room?

590
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,560
And this room...

591
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,500
Is Auntie Tim's other kid.

592
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,060
Three...

593
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,720
Two...

594
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,360
One...

595
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,020
Here we go.

596
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,320
This song sounds familiar.

597
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,040
Wanlapa.

598
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,760
It's really destiny.

Hello, I am Thiwa.

602
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,140
Why did you introduce yourself?

603
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,740
I don't want to know.

604
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,440
Hurry up with your tutoring class, so we can go.

605
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,341
No need to.

606
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:22,160
All my students already went home.

607
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,800
I have to go now. My clothes are in the washing machine.

608
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,680
I need to hang them.

609
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,183
- Aren't you going to hang your clothes?
- Yes, I am going now.

610
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:32,280
You're not going?

611
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,801
- Mom.
- What's up?

612
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,520
He will give up teaching me.

613
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,800
Again?

614
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,020
Looks like he can't handle it anyway.

615
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,500
Who would be able to handle Noey?

616
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,040
I think there is no one.

617
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,600
I just came here to teach you.

618
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,700
My responsibility is to teach you as a tutor.

619
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,580
That's all.

620
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,180
If you can defeat me,

621
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,000
I will let you teach me.

622

If you step outside the circle, you lose!

- Go!
- Hey!

625
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:01,370
Three minutes for each round. You have to win two out of the three.

626
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,440
There's no draw.

627
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:03,920
The loser will die!

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,640
Start the timer!
