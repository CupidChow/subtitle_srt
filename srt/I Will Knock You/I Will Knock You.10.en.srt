1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Can I cuddle with you? I'm afraid of ghosts.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,560
No, no, no. I don't want to!

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,840
Stop it, Noey!

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,400
Don't let me see you going anywhere with him.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,721
- What're you talking about?
- I'll give you a smack.

6
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:11,560
A representative from each group

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,920
will draw lots for the mission they will be responsible for.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,560
Even if these are just eggs,

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,220
I made them especially for you.

10
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,860
You keep looking into my eyes.

11
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,280
You're falling for me again?

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,360
Come in, please.

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,700
Jarunee's Library.

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,000
Your volunteer camp went well.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,820
Noey! No, stop fooling around.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,120
Who's fooling around?

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,440
I'm not fooling around.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,440
I am serious.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,520
Stop it, Noey. Don't tease me!

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,260
Noey! Don't…

21
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,840
It tickles.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,220
You think you can tease me?

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,040
Woah…

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,520
Noey, I gave in.

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,010

♫ My heart is the same, it has never been cared for ♫

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,260
♫ I used to be a person who didn't listen

[I Will Knock You]

36
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,020
That was exhausting and hot.

37
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,880
You shouldn't have started it.

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,960
I thought you said that was for your mom.

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,720
Is this real jade? Where did you buy it from?

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,240
-Chiangmai.
- Chiangmai?

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,600
Why, do you want it?

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,820
I think my mom might want it.

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,200
I did give it to her.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Auntie Tim.

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,460
I have something for you.

46
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,800
What's this, Noey?

47
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,220
A real jade pendant from Chiangmai can help you.

48
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,680
And why is it still with you?

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,620
I'm not sure either.

50
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,600
Huh? What's wrong with you?

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Suddenly, I felt like keeping it for myself.

52
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,280
Her restaurant is already selling well.

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,700
As for me…

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,680
I'm not that saleable.

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,280
What is he talking about?

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,240
What kind of comparison is this?

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,140
He probably doesn't know that the pendant doesn't help with business,

58
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,960
but it's a love charm.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,880
Or does he already know?

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,820
Why are you opening your mouth?

61
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,160
Please don't. Don't say what you're going to say.

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,620
Don't tell me that you love me.

63
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,680
Don't ask me to be your boyfriend or be together right now.

64
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,920
Not right now, Noey. I'm not ready!

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,560
Don't!

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,680
Oh, he just sneezed.

67
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,600
Do you have some tissues?

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,360
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,320
But they're in the tent.

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,460
Or did you catch a cold from me?

71
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
Of course I did,

72
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,100
because I can't stay away from you.

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,980
Let's go to sleep.

74
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,120
It's getting cold.

75
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,580
It's chilly.

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Let's go.

77
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,481
Sweet dreams, Noey.

78
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,420
Good night, Patthama.

79
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,440
I was Jarunee earlier.

80
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,560
Now I have a new nickname already.

81
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,080
I don't know how he comes up with all these names.

82
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,060
But anyway, good night,

83
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,180
you troublemaker.

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,300
Good morning, Noey in junior year.

85
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,860
It's time to wake up, Noey!

86
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,640
Otherwise, I'm going to school without you.

87
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,600
Time goes by really fast.

88
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,720
School break is over in the blink of an eye.

89
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,380
It's the first day of school and you made your sister late, Noey!

90
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,200
You asked me to wake you up, but you spent a lot of time getting ready.

91
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,880
My apologies, boss.

92
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,200
It won't happen again.

93
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,700
Okay, go ahead. Just go to school already.

94
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,360
Come on. Hurry up or you'll be late!

95
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,080
- We're leaving, Mom.
- Okay.

96
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,880
Good day, Auntie Tim.

97
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
Just go. Come on, you're late.

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,740
The kickstand! Kick it up.

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
Drive safely.

100
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,840
Okay.

101
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,560
Nid Nhoi is in eighth grade now.

102
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,000
As for Auntie Tim, she is the same.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,300
She's happy. Eat well and live well.

104
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,640
Noey's changed, right?

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,800
Yeah, because of Thi's influence.

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,680
Otherwise, he'd most likely have ended up like his father.

107
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,280
But you fell in love with someone like that.

108
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,380
And had two kids!

109
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,520
Well… and what of it?

110
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,640
I fell in love with a gangster.

111
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,080
What's wrong with that?

112
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,960
But I don't want my son to be like his father.

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,880
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, all right.

114
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,960
After all, he didn't take care of his family.

115
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,040
It's all me. Who knows if he's dead or alive? I was left alone.

116
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,360
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes, Ma'am.

117
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,520
Enough already.

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,660
- All right.
- All right. Whatever.

119
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,040
Please hurry, Noey. I'm already 30 minutes late.

120
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
Noted.

121
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,820
Lately, Noey always comes to pick me up and drop me off.

122
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,040
He never listens to me. He won't let me go back to my dorm alone either.

123
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,820
I don't know what he's worried about.

124
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,340
Look. He even waits while I'm teaching.

125
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,240
Hey!

126
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,720
Pay attention! Stop staring at your feet!

127
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,280
And he doesn't just wait around quietly.

128
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,920
It's okay. He won't do anything to you.

129
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,820
He waits around acting like a delinquent.

130
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,320
There he goes again. He's off to fulfill his delinquent duties.

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,440
This is something Watphlu gang must join in…

132
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,460
except me.

133
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,360
That's too much for me.

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
You're late.

135
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,820
You don't do your homework. You get into a fight every day.

136
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,360
I don't know what's up with you.

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,780
You're already in eleventh grade!

138
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:20,640
This can't hurt that much.

139
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
It does! Ouch!

140
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,870
In the end, I have to be a Watphlu medical unit.

141
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,500
They stared… They stared at me first.

142
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,560
- No, it's probably only for him, Noey Watphlu.
- And what if I stared at you?

143
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,280
Put it in the other side.

145
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,450
Gently… Ouch!

146
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,520
But one thing to be proud of…

147
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,140
Noey Watphlu seems to be focusing more on studying these days.

148
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,800
It's hot, right?

149
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,320
It's better than nothing. Just one thing at a time.

150
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,320
I think you're way too serious, Noey.

151
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I have to get good grades.

152
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,940
Otherwise, I have to listen to that goof complaining all day.

153
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,360
I see. He's your goof.

154
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,400
This goof will help with all his might.

155
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,860
What happened, Boss?

156
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,200
From now on, everyone must study hard,

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,500
and submit your homework.

158
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,360
If your score is lower than mine, you'd better watch out.

159
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,520
The new look of Watphlu has begun.

160
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,360
If I don't fail my exams,

161
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,140
he promised that he'd go to the temple fair with me.

162
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,740
Huh?

163
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,160
So I can continue with my flirting mission.

164
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,080
You mean number five?

165
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,980
After final exams, I'll take you on a trip to relax. Okay?

166
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,220
Number five.

167
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,560
This step is long overdue!

168
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,680
- What do you think?
- I don't think it'll happen.

169
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,660
You underestimate me, Thiw.

170
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,860
Natchon Jinjutha is 18th in class.

171
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,180
I told you. It won't happen.

172
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:42,140
Three point five. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, two, three point five. Fail. Fail. Fail.

173
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,000
He attended every class, but he was completely clueless.

174
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
You will get to know me soon!

175
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,080
[Thi, The Love Fanatic]

176
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,840
[Thi, The Love Fanatic]

177
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,260
Hello, Noey.

178
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,700
How are your exam results?

179
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,520
When is the temple fair?

180
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,100
I can't keep my words, Tutor.

181
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,740
I personally want to go.

182
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:57,160
I really want to go to a temple fair.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,680
Well, if you really want to go,

184
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,740
it can't be helped.

185
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,440
All right everyone, we welcome you to our big merit event.

186
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,500
I feel bad for Noey the Jerk.

187
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,860
He hasn't found his match yet.

188
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,420
Would you like a new one?

189
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,340
Let's go.

190
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,760
This is it.

191
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,280
This time. I'm sure.

192
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,240
Good Job, Thi!

193
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
Yay!

194
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,760
One more time. One more.

195
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,881
Good job.

196
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,000
One more time, please.

197
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,780
You're too obvious, Wanlapa.

198
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,800
I've already fallen so hard for you.

199
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,040
You don't have to stare at me.

200
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
I'm not going anywhere.

201
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm going to win that prize for you,

202
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,960
but you need to let me have you in exchange.

203
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,840
- Want to watch a movie?
- Watch a movie here?

204
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,120
Yeah.

205
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,640
Stop, stop!

206
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,560
Let the lady go.

207
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,880
Stop!

208
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,778
- Oh my.
- Don't shoot!

209
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:26,741
I've never watched a movie like this.

210
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,360
Don't shoot. Stop.

211
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,520
I like this movie. I've seen it many times.

212
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,760
Can you handle it?

213
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,800
Many times?

214
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,140
Can you hang in there?

215
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,486
If not, we will die together.

216
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,160
I can.

217
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,620
I see. You like to watch old Thai movies.

218
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,440
He has a lot of movies like that in his room.

219
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,542
- I have this one at home, too.
- See?

220
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:56,345
Or would you prefer to watch it at my place?

221
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,200
At his place?

222
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,680
I also have a cat.

223
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,000
Where did the cat come from?

224
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,440
Geez, he's talking nonsense.

225
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,340
Can you give up your gangster life?

226
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,204
- Oh, sorry.
- And don't ever rob anyone again.

227
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:08,023
- Oh, sorry.
- And don't ever rob anyone again.

228
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,920
You got shot.

229
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,280
Do you know that since the day I broke into you house,

230
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,920
I never robbed anyone again.

231
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,800
I got the most valuable thing in my life.

232
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,920
My last robbery was robbing your heart. Patthama.

233
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,320
This is almost the end of this movie.

234
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,900
I love you with all my heart.

235
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,880
- So what's it about?
- I'll become a better person for you.

236
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,780
So I can get into it.

237
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,680
Before this scene…

238
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,540
the male protagonist robbed wealthy people's houses.

239
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,880
- He met the female protagonist there.
- Please wait for me, Patthama.

240
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
The female protagonist is also a burglar?

241
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
Just give me a little more time.

242
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,080
She is a daughter of that house.

243
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,240
- Oh…
- Can you wait for me?

244
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,200
- I thought she was a rival gang.
- Always.

245
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,140
No matter how long it may take.

246
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,360
No matter how many years it takes, I will wait for you...

247
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,820
- Destiny…
- I will wait for you in every life.

248
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,960
- brought them together.
- But you can trust me without a doubt

249
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,380
that we will meet again because our hearts became one.

250
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,520
After that… they secretly met and flirted with each other.

251
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,060
And they become a couple, right?

252
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,860
Yes.

253
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,740
They happily love each other.

254
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,260
Please don't rob anyone in your next life.

255
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,300
But the male protagonist is a bad person, a gangster, and a thief.

256
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,720
You asked me not to steal,

257
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,380
but stealing your heart is allowed. Right?

258
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,300
I don't think they'll have a happy ending.

259
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,240
Whenever he focuses on something,

260
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,560
Noey looks pretty cool.

261
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,900
He's pretty cute and sincere.

262
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
He's quite all right.

263
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,700
- This is for you. Keep it as a symbol of my heart.
- This is for you. Keep it as a symbol of my heart.

264
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,160
I see. So this is it.

265
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,940
Noey Watphlu's inspiration…

266
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,860
comes from something like this.

267
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,720
I get it now.

268
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,580
I totally understand him now.

269
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,000
Before I die, can I kiss you farewell?

270
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,280
Where I live, we only have goats, not farewells.

271
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
Or can you kiss a horse instead?

272
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,280
You have a horse, too?

273
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,560
A rocking horse chair that is.

274
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,300
Such a cry-baby…

275
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,260
Patthama.

276
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,860
You gave me the role of the female protagonist?

277
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,840
Your male protagonist isn't dead yet.

278
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,740
Huh?

279
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,940
He will receive treatment and recover.

280
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,360
But do you know what the saddest part is?

281
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,180
Don't die. How do I live without you?

282
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,440
Her parents sent her to study abroad.

283
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,940
Come back to me. Don't die.

284
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,380
And those two never saw each other again.

285
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,560
The male protagonist had no idea where they sent her to.

286
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,820
Don't die just yet.

287
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,940
And when he heard about her, she had married and had a child.

288
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,700
This is sad.

289
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,640
That's how the story ends.

290
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,380
- Even sadder than death?
- I'm forever yours. Love, Patthama.

291
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,100
Living with a broken heart is so much more painful.

292
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,940
That lotus withered just like their love.

293
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,900
But you don't have to worry.

294
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,400
If you have to leave,

295
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,400
no matter how far,

296
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
I will follow you there.

297
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,680
I won't stop until I find you.

298
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,500
Don't ever worry. You have my word.

299
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,900
Let's make a pinky promise, Thi.

300
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,500
Come on!

301
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,380
Then you also have to promise

302
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,880
to stop being a delinquent and stop picking on others.

303
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,340
And focus on studying for your mom, your sister, and for me.

304
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,460
What's with you?

305
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,520
Can you promise me that?

306
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,340
Can you do that, my protagonist?

307
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,300
You can just tell me that you're worried about me.

308
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,760
Just admit it.

309
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,980
Noey!

310
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,880
We have a problem!

311
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,440
Behind the temple.

312
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,140
Bas came all the way here to insult us!

313
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,900
Hurry up and meet us there! I'm going to gather our gang members.

314
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Go!

315
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Then you also have to promise to stop being a delinquent and stop picking on others.

316
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,280
And focus on studying for your mom, your sister, and for me.

317
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,160
And focus on studying for your mom, your sister, and for me.

318
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,720
Whoever wins gets to ride the Ferris wheel with Thi.

319
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,780
The loser goes home.

320
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,660
Deal?

321
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,960
Go ahead and shoot first.

322
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,680
He missed one.

323
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,600
So Phayu got six in total. Not bad.

324
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,820
You challenged me to a shooting game, like you don't know Noey Watphlu at all.

325
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,120
Can Noey beat that record?

326
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,800
Noey never missed a single shot.

327
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,680
Fighting.

328
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,660
One.

329
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,460
Two.

330
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,600
Three.

331
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,400
Four.

332
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,860
Five.

333
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,620
Six.

334
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,340
And… seven!

335
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,440
He got them all!

336
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,300
Who did you hope to ride with? Phayu or me?

337
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,400
Then your wish came true because I won.

338
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,620
I planned to give you this for a while now,

339
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,100
because you belong to our Watphlu gang...

340
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,760
and you belong to me.

341
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,440
Give me a little more time.

342
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm going to be a better person for you to love.

343
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,660
I will be the person you can proudly walk with.

344
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,220
I love you, Thi Watphlu.

345
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,640
Huh?

346
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,700
You heard that right.

347
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,340
I said I love you.

348
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,300
Wait, wait! Did you hear what you just said?

349
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,620
- You're still a kid.
- I'm not a kid.

350
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,400
You haven't even finished school.

351
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,660
Well, after I graduate, do you want to move in with me?

352
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,160
Huh?

353
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,540
These fireworks represent my love for you,

354
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,700
Thi Watphlu.

355
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,540
Are they pretty?

356
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,260
Do you like it?

357
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,160
Very much.

358
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,040
You mean the fireworks?

359
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,780
Yep.

360
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,280
Geez, come on!

361
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,620
Thank you for taking me out.

362
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,220
Out of 10, how would you rate me today?

363
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,840
- Nine.
- Why only nine?

364
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,660
I deducted only one point.

365
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,180
And what did I do to lose that one point?

366
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,920
The movie you took me to see was a bit depressing.

367
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,460
Our ending won't be like that, Thi.

368
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,760
Nid Nhoi!

369
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,510
[Nid Nhoi]

370
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,540
What do you want?

371
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,800
I just took care of all your friends.

372
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,470
There's only you left.

373
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,280
Just as I thought, you chickened out.

374
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
I see…

375
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,900
You've been with your playmate.

376
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,010
Don't talk shit about other people.

377
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,940
Let's settle this behind the temple, not here!

378
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
Okay!

379
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,540
- Noey!
- Noey!

380
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,260
Are you all right?

381
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,220
Noey, enough. That's enough, son.

382
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,140
Auntie Tim!

383
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
Auntie Tim, are you okay?

384
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,520
Stop it, son. That's enough.

385
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh my god! Nid Nhoi.

386
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,440
Nid Nhoi!

387
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,000
- Oh dear.
- Nid Nhoi.

388
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,520
Nid Nhoi, are you hurt?

389
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,300
Bring it on.

390
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,040
What a wuss you are.

391
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,640
Come here!

392
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,800
Can you guys do something for me?

393
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,641
I wish that my kids will…

394
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:35,160
be good, behave, and study hard.

395
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,340
Especially, Noey. Stop acting like a delinquent.

396
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,240
In the future, you'll be the head of this family.

397
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,200
You remember it exactly word by word.

398
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,680
Mom, you say the same thing every year.

399
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,840
But Noey still misbehaves.

400
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,180
I will try, Mommy Tim.

401
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:03,300
And I'll protect this family in place of dad.

402
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,220
And… I'll focus on my studies more.

403
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
What do you mean 'focus'?

404
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,860
You drove all your tutors away.

405
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,100
Don't stress out.

406
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,460
It will affect your cooking and you'll lose your customers.

407
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,400
Well, okay. All right.

408
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Come here.

409
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,080
I'll will behave.

410
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,240
You're happy now, Mommy Tim?

411
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,640
Promise?

412
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,800
I promise, Mom. Promise…

413
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Come on. Blow out the candles.

414
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,340
Happy Birthday to Mommy Tim.

415
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,620
Oh no. Not like that.

416
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,501
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- No, no.

417
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:23,660
You didn't tell me to eat my cake. You just told me to blow the candles.

418
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,100
Hey, get him up!

419
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,700
Get up now.

420
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,340
Hurry up!

421
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,340
Stay still.

422
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,280
You think you're a badass? Here's something to enlighten you.

423
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,360
Mommy Tim!

424
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,900
- Auntie Tim!
- Mom!

425
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,300
Hey, let's get out of here.

426
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,660
Mom.

427
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,700
Auntie Tim.

428
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,780
Mom.

429
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:32,480
[Auntie Tim's]

430
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,300
[We're closed today]

431
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,740
Luckily, it was just a graze.

432
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,140
Thank you so much, Thi.

433
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,100
If you have something to do, you can leave.

434
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
I'm fine.

435
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,940
No need to worry about me.

436
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,620
I have Nid Nhoi here to take care of me.

437
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,220
Because of me, you got hurt.

438
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,600
I'm sorry.

439
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,100
I'm okay.

440
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,420
You should talk to Mom.

441
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,780
I can go home by myself.

442
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,820
You should look after your mom.

443
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,920
How will you go back from here?

444
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,700
I can walk. It's not far.

445
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,180
I won't fall over. Don't worry.

446
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,820
Hang in there!

447
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,140
You have to eat this. It's good for you.

448
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,260
Eat up, Auntie Tim, so you can take your meds.

449
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,380
- I'll check your wound later.
- Get off me.

450
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,600
- Mommy Tim!
- Leave me alone!

451
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,740
Mom.

452
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,860
Don't cry, Mommy Tim.

453
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,840
I let you down again.

454
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,720
I'm sorry that I keep causing trouble.

455
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,020
You bring me trouble every day.

456
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,720
Bring it down a notch, will you?

457
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,120
We're hot-blooded teenagers.

458
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,360
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yeah!

459
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,960
Jesus!

460
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,560
You think you can run away from me?

461
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,000
Watch it. I'm going to smack you, Noey!

462
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,380
You should go first.

463
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,360
I'll take care of this.

464
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,060
Noey!

465
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,120
The angle at the center of the circle is twice the size of

466
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,400
the angle in the circle's arc.

467
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,980
You lost me.

468
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,200
You're looking at my face? You think I'm stupid?

469
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,040
No, kid, that's not what I thought.

470
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,760
Who said you can call me that?

471
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,360
No.

472
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,880
- I'm sorry.
- Noey!

473
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,500
Hey, Noey.

474
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm sorry.

475
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,900
The circle is twice the size of the circle's arc bullshit.

476
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,640
Noey!

477
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,440
I don't get it.

478
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,680
Do I really have to know this stuff?

479
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,000
What's all this about Mommy Tim?

480
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,240
I'd better learn how to cook than learn about whatever this is.

481
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,920
You are a student. It's your duty to learn these things.

482
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,920
Go and do your homework.

483
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,440
Nid Nhoi, come and teach me.

484
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,080
I'm back, Auntie Tim.

485
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,100
Please don't be like your father.

486
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,260
I am a terrible son.

487
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,500
I can't seem to change for the better,

488
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,420
but please don't ignore me.

489
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,860
You can smack me if you want.

490
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,740
Smack me and teach me a lesson.

491
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,320
Noey!

492
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,700
That's enough, Noey!

493
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,060
Mommy Tim,

494
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,140
please don't be mad or hate me.

495
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,940
No…

496
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,940
I'm not mad, son.

497
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,120
It's all right. Mom is not mad at you.

498
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
I'm so sorry.

499
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,560
What if it was you who got stabbed last night?

500
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,740
What would I do? How could I live with that?

501
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,700
I was afraid that you'd get hurt.

502
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm so sorry, Mommy Tim.

503
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,560
I'm so sorry.

504
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,580
It's okay.

505
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,900
I'm not angry.

506
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,820
Don't cry, son. Don't cry.

507
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,560
Don't cry, son. Don't cry.

508
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Let me see your face.

509
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,480
Does it still hurt?

510
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,760
It's all right.

511
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,260
It doesn't hurt, son.

512
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,300
Hello, Thi.

513
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,840
Your father and I just arrived in Bangkok.

514
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,580
You have to eat a lot.

515
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,220
- Can I sit here, too?
- Come sit, sit.

516
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,680
Your campus is really small.

517
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,260
You bump into each other everywhere.

518
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,960
I'm so sick of your face.

519
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,397
Whoever wins gets to drop off Thi.

520
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:47,760
Hurry up. Let's go!

521
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,660
What's with you? You miss me that much?

522
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,020
Here's the thing. My parents came down from Chiangmai.

523
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,060
Don't worry.

524
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,260
I'm going to find a way to win over your parents.

525
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,940
Why didn't you educate your son?

526
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,480
Thi only comes to tutor my son.

527
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,660
I can tell what's going on just by looking.

528
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,540
My son has a bright future ahead of him.

529
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,960
And him hanging around with that kid, it's not right!

530
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,300
Get home safe. Don't think about it too much.

531
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,400
Keep fighting.

532
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,660
I really don't deserve you, Thi?

533
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,400
Auntie Tim is feeling better, right?

534
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,800
Mommy Tim said it's okay.

535
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,260
I should fix it myself.

536
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm not leaving anyone.

537
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,100
You're not? You just left me here.

538
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,460
Up until now… thank you for tutoring me.
