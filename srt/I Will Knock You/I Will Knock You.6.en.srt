00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,968
Thiw and I went to see the girls.But we run into Bas's gang.

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:04,448
Calm down, Noey!

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:05,408
Noey!

4
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:06,608
You got scammed!

5
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,308
It's our boss's plan. How awesome?

6
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,808
- Coconut Milk Ice cream that I promised to treat you.
- It's delicious!

7
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,329
- Right?
- I like it.

8
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:14,748
Just keep it. You wear it often.

9
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,588
This hair style suits you really well.

10
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:19,148
What do you want to teach me?

11
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:21,188
How about 14 times 12?

12
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,589
It's 168.

13
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,268
- And 17 times 18?
- It's 306.

14
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,988
- Hey!
- You can join my gang.

15

In front of the dorm, now.

00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,268
Huh? What did you say?

38
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,508
In front of the dorm, now!

39
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,348
It's from Noey.

40
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,548
He asked me to call you at 7:00.

What?

44
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:15,988
I don't understand it.

You got two minutes.

If you are late, I won't wait for you.

Well…

52
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,908
I don't think I can make it.

53
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,428
Too bad.

54
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:10,668
I walk really slowly.

55
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,548
It takes a long time for me to walk to my room,

56
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:13,788
open the door,

57
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:16,008
- and…
- Hey!

00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,948
I mean I will go and drag you to my bike…

by force.

61
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,728
I will be quick then.

I am sorry.

64
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:06,028
Luckily, you don't have class today.

65
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:08,708
How come?

66
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,068
The class shouldn't have been canceled.

67
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:15,228
But if you had class, I would have made you skip it anyway.

68
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,508
What's the point then?

69
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:17,788
What did you say?

70
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,108
I said…

71
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,288
Can I grab your shirt?

72
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:23,848
I almost fell down.

73
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,028
Hold onto me tight then.

74
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:28,148
I'm fine with that.

75
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,228
The temple again?

76
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:50,308
Are you afraid of the temple?

77
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,168
What?

78
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,668
Hey, you know what?

79
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,428
You are very late today.

80
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,548
I've been awake since 7:00 a.m.

81
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,108
Do you know what time it is now?

82
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,188
Look.

83
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,408
- What are you doing?
- Get off.

84
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:14,948
No.

85
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:18,068
Hey, get off!

86
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,048
Take it off.

87
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,488
Get off the bike!

88
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,328
Hurry up.

89
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,908
Ouch.

90
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,508
Come on.

91
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:39,148
Do I even have a say in this?

92
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:48,148
Hey!

93
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:51,608
Is it that loud?

94
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,788
You're so dramatic.

95
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:59,448
- Let's go.
- Wait!

96
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:04,628
Noey, you can go do your thing.

97
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,788
I will just leave for now.

98
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:07,868
Okay?

99
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,068
Hey!

100
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:11,628
We are already in front of this religious ceremony.

101
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:14,588
Where are you going? Huh?

102
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:15,948
Huh?

103
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:19,108
You have no right to say no to this.

104
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:23,308
This is what our gang has to join.

105
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:27,148
Well… I don't want to fool around,

106
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:30,148
like… with your gang!

107
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:32,908
Now, I am hungry!

108
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:34,668
Hey!

109
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,968
Are you looking down on my gang members?

110
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,188
We don't fool around.

111
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,668
This is very serious.

112
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:46,668
Can you take it seriously?

113
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,428
Well… but…

114
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,468
But what?

115
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:55,308
I am hungry. I haven't eaten breakfast yet.

116
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,108
We can go after this.

117
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,768
Okay?

118
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,508
Keep smiling.

119
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,788
Today is a good day.

120
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:17,268
Just do as I told you to.

121
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:19,868
And you won't be in trouble.

122
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,568
Let's do it!

123
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,028
How?

124
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,068
You're late, man.

125
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,468
I was waiting for him for so long.

126
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:32,608
Let's go.

127
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,168
Don't tell me…

128
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,508
How long have you been dancing?

129
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,868
Yeah, I've been dancing all the way from the front of the temple.

130
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:41,268
- Let's do it!
- In front of the temple?

131
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,243
Yeah!

132
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:46,348
How could the guy like Noey Watphlu dance like that?

133
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:49,068
I don't think so.

134
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:55,368
But well… he does!

135
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:59,428
It's over for Noey Watphlu.

136
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,588
No one's going to be afraid of him anymore.

137
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:07,228
Well… at least there's me.

138
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,488
I am still afraid of him anyway.

139
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:14,668
See? What does he want from me?

140
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:17,708
- Hey!
- Thi!

141
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,668
What are you waiting for?

142
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,588
- No…
- Hurry up.

143
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,008
Come on.

144
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:30,028
- Hurry up.
- Thiw, take care of him.

145
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:32,108
Come on.

146
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:34,228
Come.

147
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:37,100
So extreme, Noey.

148
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,668
- Come on.
- No, I don't know how to dance.

149
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:41,908
I am not good at it.

150
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,848
I am teaching you now.

151
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:48,368
I am not good at studying but you still want me to study.

152
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:54,748
Move your arms and legs now!

153
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,928
Starting with your legs first.

154
00:10:58,268 --> 00:10:59,808
And arms.

155
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,608
Hurry up.

156
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,808
I am doing it now.

157
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:09,988
Do it with more intensity!

158
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:14,748
- What are you scratching?
- This is intense.

159
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:16,388
Just move you body!

160
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,868
Here, look!

161
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:21,988
See? Can you do that?

162
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:24,688
Like this. Can you do it?

163
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:28,408
Harder! Why are you being shy?

164
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:32,588
This is the best I can do.

165
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:35,588
It's so difficult to teach you.

166
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:37,228
Damn it!

167
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:43,188
If you don't do it,

168
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,248
I will have you keep walking around.

169
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:46,728
You can't go anywhere.

170
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:50,448
Okay?

171
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:53,208
What do you say?

172
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:29,308
Hey! What's going on with him?

173
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,388
He's really not holding back.

174
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,048
Well…

175
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,688
That's surprising.

176
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:46,868
You are something.

177
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:50,588
Great job, my tutor.

178
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:19,108
Awesome!

179
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,828
How could he do that?

180
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:35,708
You did a great job, bouncy man.

181
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,448
Earlier…

182
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:47,948
You did this and also this.

183
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:49,688
That's awesome!

184
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:56,088
I am really hungry.

185
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,808
Let's wait for the money first.

186
00:13:57,808 --> 00:13:59,790
And I'll treat you.

187
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,168
At this moment,

188
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:04,568
you must pay attention to the things in front of you.

189
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:09,750
By that,

190
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,240
did you mean... you…

191
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,128
or something else?

192
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:21,808
Don't be so obvious in the temple.

193
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,948
It'd be sinful.

194
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:27,868
I was just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

195
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:32,668
- Just stay focused! Look over there.
- Okay.

196
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:46,548
Thank you.

197
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,588
Are you ready?

198
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,588
Yeah.

199
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:33,836
Don't step on me!

200
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:46,568
Ouch. What the heck! Don't step on me!

201
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:34,490
I didn't think that a person like him

202
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,640
would worry about other people.

203
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,088
Go and find shelter.

204
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:49,648
- Thank you.
- Go.

205
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,368
Hey! Move away already!

206
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,828
If you don't want it, you shouldn't get in my way.

207
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,748
What a mood killer.

208
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:11,568
I am sorry.

209
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:15,468
Why did he get in my way?

210
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:33,688
Geez, I thought he was helping me.

211
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:35,408
What the heck.

212
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,368
Damn it.

213
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,380
Geez.

214
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,848
My feet.

215
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,588
How can I go back now?

216
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:08,068
Noey, you got so many.

217
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:13,168
Wow. You got a lot as always.

218
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,228
Hey, is anyone hungry? How about we go and eat noodles?

219
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:19,728
Let's go.

220
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,668
Noodles. Okay?

221
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:27,768
Hey, Noey. What about you?

222
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:29,268
Are you coming?

223
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:32,228
I have to find my tutor first.

224
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:35,588
You guys can go first. I will follow you there.

225
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:37,508
Do you want me to help?

226
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:39,388
It's okay. This guy is too much.

227
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,508
I'll deal with him.

228
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:43,888
- All right, just hurry then.
- Okay.

229
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:49,568
Hey! By the way, he's joining our gang now?

230
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:51,568
Yeah.

231
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,248
Do you think it's okay?

232
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,848
Letting him join our Watphlu gang…

233
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,240
It'd be embarrassing if people were to find out.

234
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,628
He's all brain but no strength! That wouldn't work.

235
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,348
It's something new. It's going to be fun though.

236
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,660
Huh?

237
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:13,968
Well, I think it'll be fun.

238
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,068
Whatever you say.

239
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,028
Good! Drive carefully.

240
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,608
Whose is this?

241
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,948
Noey, I have to go now. Bye.

242
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,400
All right, see you at the restaurant.

243
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,050
See you.

244
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,368
Who are you waiting for?

245
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,630
- I am waiting for my tutor.
- Oh.

246
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,308
I see.

247
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,448
Hey. Why are you smiling, Sis?

248
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:05,968
Why are you teasing him?

249
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:08,008
You mean Thi?

250
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:12,668
He annoyed me at first.

251
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:18,048
But later on, I think it's fun. I just can't stop.

252
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:29,448
Hey, Thi!

253
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,328
Don't you have class later?

254
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:42,560
No, I am lazy.

255
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,050
Maybe…

256
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,408
That is so you, Noey!

257
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:52,368
- Why? You mean I always skip class?
- He's flirting with her?

258
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:56,188
Well, I actually want to go but I am lazy.

259
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,688
Thi!

260
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:11,208
Wait! You are wearing one shoe?

261
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:17,788
Are you crazy? Is that a trend?

262
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,868
I can't keep up with your style.

263
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,588
It's beyond me.

264
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:25,248
What's that?

265
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:48,708
I don't think anyone would steal a shoe though.

266
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,388
Maybe they found it and threw it away.

267
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:54,348
It's okay.

268
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:57,648
I can buy a new one.

269
00:21:59,548 --> 00:22:02,148
You didn't even try to find it.

270
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:07,928
I did try to find it.

271
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:11,448
It's nowhere to be found.

272
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,888
They kept stepping on my toes…

273
00:22:15,608 --> 00:22:18,508
It's better to find it sooner in the first place.

274
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:24,588
You'll use money to solve the problem again?

275
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,088
Huh?

276
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:30,788
What do you mean by again?

277
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:32,308
Like the lotus!

278
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,848
My lotus!

279
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:37,768
You forgot about it already, TaengAon?

280
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:43,300
Ouch, it hurts!

281
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,883
Do you want more?

282
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:47,808
Okay, okay. I remember it now.

283
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,648
I gave up.

284
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:53,448
If we don't buy it, what should I wear then?

285
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,588
No.

286
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,588
No freaking way!

287
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,528
No way!

288
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:11,989
- Hurry up!
- No.

289
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:15,528
We can't steal shoes from the temple.

290
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:18,188
But you are in trouble now.

291
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,408
You can return them later.

292
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:23,768
Or you can offer a pair of shoes to the temple later.

293
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:41,888
I can be your witness that you are not stealing.

294
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:46,068
You can take them and return a new pair later.

295
00:23:46,068 --> 00:23:47,968
You're right, Sis.

296
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,748
No.

297
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:09,469
Well.

298
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,388
That's it!

299
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,308
I am Thiwa Ananbhuchai.

300
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:20,268
Please let me borrow the sandals from the temple…

301
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:25,008
What's this temple's name?

302
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:28,908
Just say it in general. They know it all.

303
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:31,188
Don't dilly-dally.

304
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:37,868
Please let me borrow the sandals from the temple…

305
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:40,088
In general.

306
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,008
Will it be okay?

307
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:02,308
Hey, that's too much now.

308
00:25:27,268 --> 00:25:30,028
I have a question.

309
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,708
Why do they cut off the heels?

310
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:35,488
Every pair was cut off.

311
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:40,228
So people won't steal them. People like you.

312
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:41,648
Huh?

313
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:44,248
You just said it wasn't stealing.

314
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:47,728
Hey, stop teasing him.

315
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:50,608
Hey, Sis. It's a serious issue.

316
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:53,428
Otherwise, why do they have to cut them then? Right?

317
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,768
If it's damaged, people don't want to take them.

318
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,308
Well, this can…

319
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:02,468
avoid sinning at the same time.

320
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:06,068
Adinnathana Veramāni…

321
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,668
Sikkhapadang Samadiyami.

322
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,388
Do not steal.

323
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:12,128
Right, Sis?

324
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:23,128
Can we return them now?

325
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:37,088
Hey, Noey! Where have you been?

326
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:39,088
Took you so long to get here.

327
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:01,908
The same thing for him?

328
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:15,408
Just take them off then.

329
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:17,788
And walk on your bare feet.

330
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,108
Are you still thinking of it?

331
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:25,248
Then… I will carry you to your dorm.

332
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:26,588
How about that?

333
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:28,188
So you don't have to walk.

334
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,341
I think it's quite comfy actually.

335
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,630
Wide rice noodles with soup. No cilantro.

336
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,168
Meatball added,

337
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:50,910
meat patty, meat, minced meat, and liver.

338
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,680
Here you go.

339
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:57,508
Too long. I can't remember what's in it.

340
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:00,488
It doesn't matter, just eat it!

341
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:19,588
Okay.

342
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:21,708
I'm going to dig in now.

343
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,588
Why did you tell me that?

344
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:25,688
Just dig in!

345
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:37,628
Slow down or you'll choke.

346
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,108
Wow!

347
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:41,188
Very delicious.

348
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:46,528
You want more of that? Order now, so you won't have to wait.

349
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,310
Piggy.

350
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,808
Hey! Can I have one more, please?

351
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:52,648
Sure.

352
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:05,648
We really don't have to pay for it?

353
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:08,368
Yeah.

354
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:14,368
But I feel bad for him.

355
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,008
He's just making a living.

356
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,808
Don't poke you nose into it.

357
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:23,788
I didn't think that you could be this awful.

358
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:26,988
It's not cool when you take advantage of others.

359
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:44,508
If you don't know anything,

360
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:47,028
just keep your mouth shut.

361
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:49,068
It doesn't look cool.

362
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:00,448
Okay.

363
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:03,608
That was very scary!

364
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:06,588
He was looking at me like he was about to beat me up.

365
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:09,900
Like this. This close!

366
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,248
Hey, enough already. Your shirt is all messy now.

367
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,249
- Wow…
- So dramatic.

368
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:22,028
No, I wasn't being dramatic.

369
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,248
I am really afraid of him.

370
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:26,568
Really? Why didn't you run away then? Just avoid him.

371
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:28,888
I wish I could do that.

372
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:32,268
But his mom already paid for it.

373
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:37,488
And I already promised that I would tutor him.

374
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:41,328
It's useless to teach that kid.

375
00:30:41,328 --> 00:30:43,328
It's a waste of money and time!

376
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:44,368
That's right.

377
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:45,568
Yeah.

378
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:46,828
Listen to me.

379
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:50,288
You don't have to waste your time with that kid.

380
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:53,688
Trust me. Just go back on your words and quit.

381
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,588
You guys don't know. Right?

382
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,908
I already joined the Watphlu gang.

383
00:31:03,908 --> 00:31:05,008
Huh?

384
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:06,708
What?

385
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:11,290
Wait, how? You need to explain it to us.

386
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:15,508
He accepted me into the Watphlu gang.

387
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:20,368
So the gang name became my surname…

388
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,768
It's Thi Watphlu!

389
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,108
Thi Watphlu?

390
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:28,268
It's cool, isn't it?

391
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,488
What are you talking about? You said you were afraid of him.

392
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:36,088
Oh, yeah.

393
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:37,708
Then, why did you join the gang?

394
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:41,791
- Huh?
- Calm down.

395
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:46,308
How about this? We can go to talk to Auntie Tim.

396
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:48,108
I don't think it'd be difficult.

397
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:51,128
At least, she could tell her son not to bother you anymore.

398
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:54,848
No, I don't want to break my promise.

399
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:58,068
Geez, then how can we help you?

400
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:00,888
Yeah?

401
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:08,288
[Nid Nhoi, Auntie Tim's daughter]

402
00:32:09,788 --> 00:32:10,888
[Nid Nhoi, Auntie Tim's daughter]

403
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,688
Nid Nhoi.

404
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:16,468
Noey's sister.

405
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,628
Just pick up then.

406
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,428
Yeah.

407
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:21,288
I'll just pick it up for you then.

408
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:23,828
I'll do it.

409
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:31,228
Hello, Nid Nhoi.

410
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,768
Noey's going to see you now.

411
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,088
He asked me to tell you to wait at your dorm.

412
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,488
- Huh?
- Don't go anywhere.

413
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,749
Really?

414
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:42,028
He has no money in his phone, and he doesn't carry it with him either.

415
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:44,588
I might call you quite often.

416
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,908
Often?

417
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:50,600
Seems like he hangs out with you a lot lately, Thi Watphlu.

418
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,970
I'm hanging up now. Goodbye.

419
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:04,268
Can you guys stay over tonight?

420
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,428
Look! Here he comes.

421
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:32,968
Noey Watphlu.

422
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:37,388
This kid?

423
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:39,668
I'll take care of him. What?

424
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:42,068
Damn. With the broom?

425
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:44,931
Are you crazy? You're fooling around.

426
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:49,248
He doesn't look that scary.

427
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:56,108
Well, are you going to see him now?

428
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:01,688
Or maybe we shouldn't?

429
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:03,828
I just saw him today.

430
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:07,468
He came alone.

431
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:10,728
Maybe he wants you to teach him something.

432
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:12,968
I think it's okay.

433
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,448
We are also here, too.

434
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:21,668
Is that the hairstyle you did before?

435
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,048
Hey! That was super cool.

436
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:27,328
I want to join Watphlu gang, too.

437
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:29,568
Like… Tong Watphlu. Ouch!

438
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,908
It's stressful for him. What's going on with you?

439
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:34,508
I really want to join the gang.

440
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:36,208
What?

441
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,028
Why not?

442
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:59,070
These are your friends?

443
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:04,048
Well, yes, we are working on a report.

444
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:05,888
We are very busy.

445
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:09,048
So we don't have much time.

446
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:11,808
- Right guys?
- Yeah.

447
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:20,748
Here you go.

448
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,828
What is this?

449
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:34,768
It's my homework.

450
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:37,510
I didn't go to school today but I have homework to do.

451
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:42,308
Well, I'm not free to teach you today.

452
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,268
Who asked you to teach?

453
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:50,128
You can do it when you are free.

454
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:52,688
The question is on that sheet.

455
00:35:53,748 --> 00:35:55,868
You can write on it.

456
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:01,288
Wait!

457
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:06,028
You want me to do your homework?

458
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:07,628
Yeah.

459
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:09,368
I'm leaving now.

460
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:12,368
Wait! Wait!

461
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:15,508
This won't do.

462
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:18,008
I'm not going to do it.

463
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,048
Why?

464
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:30,148
Your mom hires me to teach you, not to do your homework.

465
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,148
This is not right!

466
00:36:34,948 --> 00:36:37,548
How much for doing my homework?

467
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:39,368
Is it more expensive?

468
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,708
I'm not doing it.

469
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,968
What's the difference?

470
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,128
I do it after you teach me.

471
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:03,208
Submit to the teacher, then I get points.

472
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:07,028
And you do it,

473
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:10,448
submit to the teacher, then I also get points.

474
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:13,108
Why do we have to waste time on it?

475
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,648
But what will you gain from that?

476
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:16,248
Scores, of course.

477
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,048
But you won't gain any knowledge.

478
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,268
Knowledge?

479
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,148
Like multiplication tables?

480
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:32,388
Then, what did you buy a calculator for?

481
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,968
I am also confused.

482
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:47,168
I have no idea how to answer that.

483
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:51,668
If you can answer me,

484
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:57,128
I will do it by myself and let you teach me.

485
00:37:57,128 --> 00:38:00,788
Let's just go. You don't have to say anything.

486
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:03,988
I don't think he will understand it.

487
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:06,108
Let's go.

488
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:07,748
All right, let's go.

489
00:38:22,888 --> 00:38:26,488
What's 21 times 34?

490
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:30,728
It's 714.

491
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:36,868
Hey, that's correct.

492
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,908
It's 714.

493
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:48,708
You just answered me with your own voice.

494
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,908
The calculator doesn't do that.

495
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:54,868
It means the calculator taught you.

496
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:07,068
You remembered that answer and then you answered me.

497
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:08,808
Right?

498
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:15,288
It's 714.

499
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:19,208
Then I can't answer it for you.

500
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,988
You have to remember it so as to answer the teacher yourself.

501
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:29,728
You're good at beating around the bush.

502
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:38,328
Tomorrow at 4:00!

503
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:42,648
At Watphlu temple. You will go there to teach me.

504
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:49,668
Then I will remember the answer from you and do this homework.

505
00:39:57,568 --> 00:39:59,588
You calculator.

506
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:35,008
It finally begins.

507
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:37,888
Keep fighting, by the way.

508
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,288
The little boy…

509
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:42,608
Noey Watphlu.

510
00:40:45,788 --> 00:40:49,388
Hey, did you take my temple's sandals?

511
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,528
Don't you see who's with him?

512
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:54,896
Noey Watphlu.

513
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:57,570
Hey, not every boy in the temple

514
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,593
will be as nice as Noey Watphlu. You're scared, aren't you?

515
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,668
Do you mind taking me to the temple we went to yesterday?

516
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,068
- That's it?
- I feel better now.

517
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:08,408
If I give this to Pam, will she like it?

518
00:41:08,408 --> 00:41:09,528
She might like it.

519
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:12,108
Or we should try making it into a bouquet?

520
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,448
Roses are the most popular.

521
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:16,008
Do you want to practice?

522
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,468
I will be Pam.

523
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,288
And you'll try flirting with me.

524
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:21,108
All right, so you will be Pam.

525
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:22,988
I will be Noey Watphlu.

526
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:25,368
First off, can I ask you something?

527
00:41:25,368 --> 00:41:28,028
Why do you like Pam that much?

528
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,668
Is that necessary for you to help me?

529
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,388
It's for character information. So I can immerse myself in it.

530
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,509
We're here, Thi. That's enough.

531
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:38,828
It's not like you to do your own homework.

532
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:39,789
It's okay.

533
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,388
Do you believe in destiny?

534
00:41:41,388 --> 00:41:42,868
No, not really.

535
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:43,973
Why?

536
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:46,112
I think it's…

537
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,200
♫ Destiny inspires and leads ♫

538
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,180
♫ Letting us meet immediately ♫

539
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,250
♫ Before this, we lived very far away from each other,
destiny controlled our hearts ♫

540
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,170
♫ So I moved closer to you ♫

541
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:31,290
♫ Destiny determines everything ♫

542
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:36,410
♫ And sets the path for everyone ♫

543
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,470
♫ One's life is destined, making soulmates meet each other ♫

544
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:46,400
♫ Which it has bestowed you to me ♫

545
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,560
♫ One's life is destined, making soulmates meet each other ♫

546
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,030
♫ Which it has bestowed you to me ♫

547
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:02,060
