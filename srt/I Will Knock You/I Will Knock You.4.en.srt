1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,420
You can't take your eyes off my handsome face?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,520
You must be careful. I think he's scary.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,780
We should avoid him.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,300
Hurry up! Want me to feed you?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,680
- Wait.
- Hey!

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,280
Just do as he said!

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,040
What's with all these questions?

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,480
No, I want to go home now.

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,040
It's better than nothing!

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,000
I will protect you. Nid Nhoi, run over here.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,920
I am angry now!

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,100
Noey Watphlu!

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,700
Are you still looking at me?

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,341
- Hello, Auntie Tim.
- Hello.

15
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:30,863
I will take you upstairs. Today you will be able to teach for sure.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,160
Wanlapa.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,080
So…

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,840
Wanlapa's story begins now.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,780
But what's going on?

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,200
Seems like I can't run away from him.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,180
I am afraid of him and angry at the same time from what he has done to me.

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,680
All right. I should gather myself up and teach this kid a lesson!

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,040
- Noey Watphlu!
- Ouch!

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,740
Hey! How long you're going to stand there?

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,720
Well, hello, my name is Thiwa.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,700
You can just call me Thi.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,720
- From now on, I will come here to teach…
- Just Thi,

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,360
Why did you have to introduce yourself?

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,640
I don't want to know.

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,570
Not "Just Thi".

31
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,980
I mean you can just call me Thi.

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,000
Your name is too boring.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Thi!

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Dorky!

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
Goofy!

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,700
Wait! Who is Goofy?

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,860
And can you just call me nicely?

38
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,980
I am older than you.

Yes, I think I will open the window.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,590
Let the wind in to cool down the room.

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
You…

74
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,860
How long do I have to spend time with you?

75
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,300
What?

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,260
How long do I have to stay in this room with you?

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,320
Oh, two hours.

78
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,470
But I have a special offer for you.

79
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,320
Only one hour is fine.

80
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,280
My mom would be at a loss then!

81
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,360
She paid for two hours but you teach me only one hour.

82
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,140
Doing this to your client makes you super rich I guess.

83
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,400
No! No!

84
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
Then I can teach you for two hours.

85
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,360
Here, let's get started.

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
So you won't lose any money.

87
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,300
Well, I prepared overall sophomore material for this class.

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,280
You're a sophomore, right?

89
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,900
Yeah!

90
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,720
So…

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,160
Today, we can discuss which part you want me to focus on.

92
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,100
Or which subject you want me to teach.

93
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,980
Next time, I will prepare and customize the material for you.

94
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,720
It's about Pam.

95
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,080
Huh?

96
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,340
I want to learn about Pam.

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,260
I want her worksheet.

98
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,100
I want her notes.

99
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,080
I want to know what she likes or dislikes.

100
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,801
But it's not about this class at all.

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,440
If you teach me about Pam, then I am your student.

102
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,040
How come that's not studying?

103
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,440
But it's not a sophomore subject.

104
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,340
How come it is not?

105
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,020
What grade am I in now? Tenth grade!

106
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,460
My feelings right now,

107
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,980
and I'm a sophomore, how can it not be?

108
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,500
And learning has no limits. Right?

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,940
Can I choose to learn what I want?

110
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,480
This is confusing.

111
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,460
You make me feel guilty.

112
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,060
- You're so useless, Wanla…
- Wanlapa?

113
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,440
Let's get into it.

114
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,740
If you only teach me from a textbook,

115
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,700
I can just ask Ohm and Thiw to read it for me.

116
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,210
Just go away!

117
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,980
I accept the loss only for this time.

118
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,760
Because you want to teach what I don't want to learn.

119
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,300
Wait!

120
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,380
You can't just go.

121
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't know what to do next.

122
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,140
What do you want from me?

123
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,520
Hey, I wasted too much time with you.

124
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,800
You keep bothering me.

125
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,850
It's my responsibility to come here

126
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,280
and teach you as your tutor.

127
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,340
That's all.

128
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,380
Later then.

129
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
How about today?

130
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,400
What would your mom say if I didn't teach you today?

131
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,760
Don't use my mom to threaten me.

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,820
If you really don't want to study,

133
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,780
how about you talk to your mom about this?

134
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,500
I can return the money, all of it.

135
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,320
Where are you taking me?

136
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,100
- Mom.
- Yes?

137
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,920
He wants to give up teaching me.

138
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,690
I told you. It won't work.

139
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,300
Well, I think I might not be good enough to be his tutor.

140
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,440
It's okay. I understand it.

141
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,710
I will return the money to you then.

142
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,990
You don't have to. Just keep it.

143
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,260
I wasted your time too many times.

144
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,520
Want to have something before you leave?

145
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,460
Nid Nhoi, find a table for him to sit

146
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,800
What do you want to eat, dear?

147
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,060
It's okay. I am not that hungry.

148
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,080
Noey! You should see him off to his dorm!

149
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,180
You wasted his time. Come on!

150
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,700
What are you saying, Auntie Tim?

151
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,060
It's okay!

152
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,580
Goodbye, Auntie Tim.

153
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,660
I will visit your restaurant again.

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,700
I think it's safer if he goes back by himself, Auntie Tim.

155
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Auntie Tim, my ass!

156
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,060
Noey and I got our ass from you.

157
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,340
I was being sarcastic.

158
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,200
- Again?
- Yes.

159
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,660
From what I see, I think he can't do it. Who would put up with Noey?

160
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,260
There's no one.

161
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,700
I told you. It's better if you let me teach him.

162
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,440
I am leaving now, Auntie Tim. Goodbye.

163
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,020
All right. Thank you, Waew!

164
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,880
Nid Nhoi, you go check if customers want some drinks or not.

165
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,300
- Don't let them wait.
- Sure.

166
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,560
Wait. I can go back by myself.

167
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,380
My mom said so.

168
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,160
Just do what she said.

169
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,400
I just want to keep my words.

170
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,900
You said you'll leave Pam alone,

171
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,080
- You don't even keep your words…
- When did I tell you that?

172
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,400
I don't bother O anymore, this is good enough for you!

173
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,080
You gave me one Gourd.

174
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,560
That's an exchange with one person.

175
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,240
It's a Jade Pandent Gourd!

176
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,600
Say it right!

177
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,940
You can go now.

178
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,340
I can just walk out.

179
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,400
It's not far at all.

180
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,280
You want to fall into the water?

181
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,740
How dare you call my name? You Shallow Water Tutor.

182
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Get on.

183
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,580
If you don't get on the bike, I will force you.

184
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
Or do you want me to carry you like in the movies?

185
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Get on!

186
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,740
Okay, okay! You don't have to scold me.

187
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,760
Well, where is a helmet?

188
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
What?

189
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
A helmet.

190
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,340
If you don't have one, I won't go with you!

191
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,000
No way!

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
You're too much!

193
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,700
Is he going to get it?

194
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,880
He never tells me anything.

195
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,260
Slowly, please. I am not in hurry!

196
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,400
Hey, wait! I dropped something!

197
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,460
Geez.

198
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,860
Hurry up! You're such a slowpoke.

199
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,950
- It's over there!
- Where?

200
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,200
Hurry up! Wear the helmet!

201
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,040
Just leave it! Wear the helmet and get on the bike.

202
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,000
You want a helmet, right?

203
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,620
- Hurry up!
- Okay, I got it now! Ride slowly, please.

204
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,160
Slowly, please! I told you to drive slowly!

205
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,240
That's too fast.

206
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,700
Wow. I thought you weren't coming, Boss.

207
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,220
Wait! Well, so we…

208
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,120
Well, so we… we can just go our own way. Right?

209
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,800
What do you mean?

210
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,860
I told you I would drop you off at your dorm.

211
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,820
Can't you just wait a bit?

212
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,440
Hey! What is he doing with the cooking pot?

213
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,600
Who knows?

214
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,920
♫ Just by looking into your eyes, they change something in my heart ♫

215
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,400
- What?
- Let's go.

216
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,040
♫ My heart trembles ♫

217
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,920
♫ Every night and every day ♫

218
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,400
♫ I still keep thinking of you ♫

219
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,300
- What are you doing? No!
- Come with me.

220
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,460
- Hurry up!
- I'm going to hit you.

221
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,980
- Hurry up!
- I'm going to hit you.

222
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,180
Hey! Wow, he is fierce!

223
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,600
Come here.

224
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,420
- No…
- Come here!

225
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,240
Please let me go.

226
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,940
Go ahead.

227
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,120
You seem weak.

228
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,160
How can a weakling like you survive if you get bullied?

229
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,120
Life is not that easy in this society.

230
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,420
I don't think there's anywhere worse.

231
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,320
Well… I will teach you a P.E. subject.

232
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,000
What?

233
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,180
If you win, I'll let you teach me with no excuses!

234
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Okay?

235
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,100
How about that, Jamnien?

236
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,600
As expected, this kid won't call my name properly.

237
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,200
Wanlapa, Jarunee, and Jamnien.

238
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,220
How can he think of those names?

239
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,700
They don't suit me at all.

240
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,900
But…

241
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,920
with…

242
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,100
this kid,

243
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,340
I think that style suits him well.

244
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,460
His looks, the way he dresses, and the way he speaks.

245
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,540
Actually, he is pretty good-looking and charming in a vintage way.

246
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,140
Hey!

247
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,000
That's too long.

248
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,960
You can't fall in love with me every single moment.

249
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,060
Well…

250
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,940
I will assume that you have accepted my offer.

251
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,440
Yeah!

252
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,740
Noey Watphlu!

253
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,960
Noey Watphlu!

254
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,300
If you're outside the circle, you will lose! Go.

255
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,496
Noey Watphlu!

256
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:47,681
- Start the timer!
- You got a timer? How long?

257
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,980
What if it's a draw? What if I lose?

258
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,250
Three minutes for each round. You have to win two out of three rounds.

259
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,460
There is no draw for this.

260
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,860
- The loser will die!
- What?

261
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,380
Start!

262
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,280
Noey Watphlu!

263
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,140
Hey…

264
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,700
Firstly, you must look at your enemy,

265
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,740
not keeping your head down like this.

266
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,980
If you keep your head down,

267
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,280
how can you see whether you should defend or fight back?

268
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,880
Hey, are you going to cry?

269
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,400
No.

270
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,640
Be patient. Then your fear will disappear.

271
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,960
A man's tears.

272
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,940
I'll practice wiping it for you for now.

273
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,590
I won't comfort you the next time.

274
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,160
You must learn to stand on your feet.

275
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,020
I haven't even cried yet.

276
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,220
Stop being weak or whining in front of others.

277
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,760
Five, Four, Three,

278
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,141
Two, One!

279
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,380
First round is a draw.

280
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,060
Come on! Let's get it!

281
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:04,860
- Come on! Go ahead!
- Punch!

282
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,360
Do you have the guts to do it?

283
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,740
Do you?

284
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,360
Punch.

285
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,100
Be brave!

286
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,260
I will go easy on you.

287
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,580
If your hand touches anywhere on my face,

288
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,060
then you're a winner.

289
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,860
Do you have the guts?

290
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,380
Punch.

291
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,760
Go! Just Go!

292
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
Jesus Christ!

293
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,460
Woah!

294
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,780
I am sorry.

295
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,040
It wasn't intentional.

296
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,940
I forget my bag.

297
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,920
I am going now. Goodbye, everyone.

298
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,401
Hey! That was very insulting.

299
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah! Let's go beat him up.

300
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Let's go.

301
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,420
Stop!

302
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,280
Just let him go.

303
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,120
You became more determined, Thi.

304
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,420
But next time, I won't go easy on you.

305
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,940
It doesn't hurt that much.

306
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,900
Just a weak punch. I don't think he will be angry.

307
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,040
I guess.

308
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,820
What if he's angry?

309
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,860
The Watphlu Gang will…

310
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,960
Damn it! Why do I have to do this?

311
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,460
I can't do this anymore.

312
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,860
No! No!

313
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,600
The hole is still shallow!

314
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,200
I hope it won't be that bad.

315
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,100
- What should we have for the dinner?
- Anything.

316
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,720
- What about Papaya Salad?
- Sure.

317
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,700
Hey, Thi, do you want to join us?

318
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
Thi!

319
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,420
Hey!

320
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,540
What's going on?

321
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,200
I just ask if you want to have dinner with us.

322
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,520
No, I have my tutoring class today.

323
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,200
You guys can go ahead.

324
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Oh, well. Okay.

325
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,340
- What's going on with him?
- I don't know either.

326
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,080
Let's go.

327
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,740
Thi,

328
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,160
can we go get our snacks?

329
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,860
Okay.

330
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,100
Let's have a 15-minute break.

331
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,520
Thank you.

332
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,220
Let's go.

333
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,180
Hurry up.

334
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,960
Hey, check this out.

335
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,540
What?

336
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,041
Hey! Again?

337
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,980
- The other one was seriously injured.
- I feel bad for him.

338
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,060
That's scary.

339
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,080
It's just nearby our school. Right?

340
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,641
- What happened?
- There is a big fight near our school.

341
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,260
I see.

342
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,560
- Right. Do you know Noey Watphlu?
- What?

343
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,120
Don't tell me…

344
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,500
the Watphlu Gang?

345
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,460
Yes.

346
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Oh, it seems like you know them.

347
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,460
I will tell you something.

348
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,360
This gang walks past our school a lot.

349
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,000
So scary!

350
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,520
But I think Noey Watphlu looks very cool though.

351
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,320
That's right. But still scary anyway.

352
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,660
Who would want to be around him?

353
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,000
He's only a sophomore. Right?

354
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,100
Yeah, he is a sophomore.

355
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,520
But I am not sure about other gang members,

356
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,040
Whether they are still in school or not.

357
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,820
No need to study. Being a gangster is way better.

358
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,900
Yeah, that's right.

359
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,200
You always said that.

360
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,340
Well… but…

361
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,300
How do you know that Noey and his gang?

362
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,100
Nonsense! I don' t know him at all.

363
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,580
Are you ready to continue the lesson?

364
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,640
Everyone is here now?

365
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,820
Ready.

366
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,020
Noey.

367
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,510
Thi, I have to leave early today.

368
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,680
My mom is calling me.

369
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,740
You are leaving already?

370
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,440
Three students left.

371
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,660
Four, including me.

372
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,460
Thi, then I'd like to leave too.

373
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,580
My dad doesn't want me to get home late today.

374
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,220
Well, then, I'm leaving now.

375
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,460
What a small world!

376
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,780
Speaking of the devil.

377
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,060
Can I take a photo with you, Noey? Just one photo.

378
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,390
Let's go. What are you talking about?

379
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,960
Can I take a photo, please?

380
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,880
No, let's go.

381
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,120
Get the phone.

382
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,920
See you again, Noey.

383
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,640
Don't go…

384
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,640
Well… I have to go now.

385
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,780
My clothes are in a washing machine. I need to hang them up.

386
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,420
Otherwise, they won't dry.

387
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,960
Aren't you going to hang your clothes?

388
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,900
I am leaving now.

389
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,800
What?

390
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,040
Why are you still here?

391
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,940
I want to, but…

392
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,020
But what?

393
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,540
Huh?

394
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,480
But…

395
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,780
that can wait.

396
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,520
Good!

397
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,180
I am sorry about yesterday.

398
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,780
It wasn't intentional.

399
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,680
It's from my mom.

400
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,460
Eat up.

401
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,200
What?

402
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,900
I am not hungry.

403
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,080
How dare you say no after I gave you this?

404
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,420
No manners at all.

405
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,340
I don't think I'm the one who has no manners.

406
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,000
Just eat it.

407
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,700
Hey!

408
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,620
Hurry up and eat and teach, so we can go!

409
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,300
Teach?

410
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,460
The class is canceled.

411
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,440
All my students went home already.

412
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,420
There's one left.

413
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,160
No one left.

414
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,780
They all went home.

415
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,500
Hey!

416
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,720
My boss said that there is one student left, and that student is you!

417
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,300
Idiot!

418
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
Do you know that word, Idiot?

419
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,400
Geez, what an idiot!

420
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,380
I think that student is Noey.

421
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,620
He meant the student, not the tutor.

422
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,100
Hey!

423
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,940
Is that right, Noey?

424
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
Who is an idiot now?

425
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,380
Oh, are you insulting me?

426
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,740
You're talking about me?

427
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,840
It's the herbal drink.

428
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,420
Do you want me to feed you, or can you eat it by yourself?

429
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,980
You don't have to.

430
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,960
I can eat it by myself.

431
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,100
Eat up then.

432
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Hurry up.

433
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,880
Come on, eat it!

434
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,860
Okay, okay.

435
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,560
It's very good.

436
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,280
Yummy!

437
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,540
Here, drink some water.

438
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,700
Yummy!

439
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,160
Which one do your prefer? This one,

440
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,560
or the one you had on the rooftop?

441
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,200
Your cooking?

442
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,100
Rooftop?

443
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,040
Well…

444
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,680
It's…

445
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,240
It's kinda…

446
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,740
- Kinda…
- Hey!

447
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,900
Just spit it out already!

448
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Both are delicious!

449
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,780
Your cooking and your mom's cooking are the same.

450
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,640
I thought you would be more honest.

451
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,040
Huh?

452
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,740
My food was not delicious at all.

453
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,480
It's not even as good as my mom's cooking.

454
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,240
Well, it's not that bad.

455
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,100
I will try it again.

456
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,800
I rarely cook, so I still lack experience.

457
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,080
I'll let you try it.

458
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,640
And you will forget all about my mom's cooking.

459
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,880
Well, so…

460
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,540
Please thank your mom for me.

461
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,000
It's getting dark now. I'd better go.

462
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,700
Sit…

463
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,920
Sit down.

464
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,900
Sit down.

465
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,180
Some dessert for you.

466
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,000
You seem to enjoy it.

467
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I bought it for you.

468
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,960
Huh?

469
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,740
Orange.

470
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,640
All right, then.

471
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,020
Go ahead and teach. Whatever you want to teach.

472
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,120
Wait.

473
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,380
You're going to let me teach you?

474
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
You silly boy!

475
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,820
Should I be the one teaching you, then?

476
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,760
Real idiot!

477
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,820
I already told you that I won't teach you anymore.

478
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,110
It's better if I return the money to you.

479
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,820
So we don't owe each other anything.

480
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,420
Hey!

481
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,780
You won.

482
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,920
I lost.

483
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,460
I must keep the promise.

484
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,940
What promise?

485
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,700
If you win, I'll let you be my tutor with no excuses.

486
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,760
Okay?

487
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,700
Do you remember now?

488
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,780
What do you say, Jamnien?

489
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,060
How come I won that?

490
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,020
I ran away from the circle.

491
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,440
Before you left,

492
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,920
you punched me in the face.

493
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,120
I lost.

494
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,240
It was just a weak punch. Right?

495
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,280
It doesn't matter weak or strong, you punched my face.

496
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,980
Here, hurry up. I am ready.

497
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,920
I don't know anything.

498
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,040
I didn't prepare anything.

499
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,740
Well, what do you want me to teach?

500
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,760
What are you studying now?

501
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,300
Or how should we do this…

502
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,720
I am not ready at all.

503
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,780
Can I take a rain check?

504
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,600
If you don't teach me, I won't go back.

505
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
Hey.

506
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,640
Seriously?

507
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,700
I am not kidding.

508
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,640
Well, you can teach me anything.

509
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,780
Just any course that you can remember.

510
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,300
Just teach me. Anything!

511
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,500
Anything in the course.

512
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,600
Just pick one.

513
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,120
If you do a great job,

514
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,600
I…

515
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,300
- I will buy you coconut milk ice cream.
- Huh?

516
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,400
I'm trying my best to persuade you.

517
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,700
Hey!

518
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,740
Hurry up and teach him!

519
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,140
Coconut milk ice cream, he said!

520
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,080
He doesn't do that a lot.

521
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,660
You'd be stupid to not take it.

522
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,260
Take it!

523
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,400
You'll go back if I teach you, right?

524
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,320
Well, let's do it this way.

525
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,180
Let's check and see which level we should start from.

526
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,540
'Level'?

527
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,540
I think 'level' means difficulty levels of the course.

528
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,840
Do you know what this is?

529
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,180
Circles.

530
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,560
What?

531
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,220
Yeah, they're two circles!

532
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,340
Why are you so surprised?

533
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,780
Um… What do you see in this picture?

534
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,020
- Circles.
- Two circles.

535
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,780
Yeah, if they're not circles, then what the heck are they?

536
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,540
Hey, what's with you and those circles?

537
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,940
You didn't finish our lessons yesterday either.

538
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,180
Why did you take that long?

539
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,300
Do you think I should waste my time

540
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,600
just to learn about these circles?

541
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,580
Gosh…

542
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,680
Wish I could say it out loud.

543
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,220
But I am afraid they'll beat me up.

544
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,740
From now on, we will study about… union and intersection!

545
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,120
Whatever!

546
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,220
There's no turning back now. I am a teacher.

547
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,580
I can't choose who I'd like to teach.

548
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,960
No matter how scary my students are.

549
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,060
I will give it a try. I'm Thi, the best tutor!

550
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,800
A mission of transforming these gangsters into students.

551
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,480
We'll go for it!

552
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,780
I won't run away.

553
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,620
I will fight with you.

554
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,560
I promised Auntie Tim that I would do my best.

555
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,110
I will keep my word.

556
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,620
I never lie.

557
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,580
I won't give up, leave,

558
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,920
run away, or give up on my students.

559
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,360
Yeah, I should go for it!

560
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,560
Now, you tell me.

561
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,840
What are we going to study next?

562
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,000
Please Noey, say something that makes me feel hopeful.

563
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,060
Well… circles.

564
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,900
Well… they're two circles.

565
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,820
You tutor.

566
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,730
Or should I just give in?

567

[Director: Weerachit Thongjila]

568
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,220
Why don't we have a lesson at your home today?

569
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,340
Yesterday, I already attended your class.

570
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
So, today, it's my turn to teach you.

571
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,180
You really go all out for it.

572
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,520
Do you like me that much? I surrender.

573
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,280
Four times eight equals 32. Four times nine… 36!

574
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,440
Four times ten equals 40.

575
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,500
Four times 11 equals 41.

576
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,620
Well, it should be 44.

577
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,420
Just a small mistake. It's fine.

578
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,140
Yeah, it's okay. Fighting.

579
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,860
Boss!

580
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,100
Well, Thiw and I went to see some girls behind Wortor Dorm,

581
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,680
But we run into Bas's gang.

582
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,860
Bas asked me to tell you that you can meet him behind Wortor Dorm.

583
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,260
Calm down, Noey! Noey!

584
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,880
What should I do? How can I stop him?

585
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,781
Geez. The person that could stop him would be so damn cool.

586
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,960
- Let's go for it! Fight until we die!
- Until you die?

587
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,080
Go!

588
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,059
- Hey!
- Bye-bye!

589
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:49,260
Let's go!

590

Do you know that Wortor Dorm?

591
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,480
