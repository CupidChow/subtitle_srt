Hello, my name is Thiwa.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
Why did you introduce yourself? I don't want to know.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,020
Hurry up and teach. So you can go.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,940
How long do I have to stay in this room with you?

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,920
If you really don't want to learn, why don't you talk to your mom about this?

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,220
- Mom.
- Yes?

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,660
- He wants to cancel the class.
- Noey! Drop him off at his dorm.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,740
If you win, I will let you be my tutor with no excuses.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,440
Hurry up and teach whatever you want to teach.

10

Do you know what this is?

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,440
What do you see from this picture?

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,120
They're two circles.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,020
You tutor.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,087
It's ready now.

15
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:54,473
The course for Noey Watphlu.

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,160
Four times two equals 8.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,980
Four times three equals 12.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,440
Four times four equals 16.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,700
- Four times five equals 20.
- Awesome.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,460
Four times six equals 24.

21
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,360
Four times seven equals 27. Oh, 28!

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,340
Go on…

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,740
Four times eight equals 32.

24
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,820
You're a lost cause. I thought you'd be smarter than this.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,200
Geez, Nid Nhoi.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,840
What about you then?

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
This is a multiplication table of four!

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,100
Table of four.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,800
What's the result of four times four? It's 16.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,480
Table of four.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,780
Four times five equals 20.

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,460
See? It's not that easy.

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,180
Geez, four times one equals four.

34
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,140
Hey, why are you smiling, dorky?

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,960
Just calm down.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,380
You keep looking at me all dreamy. I can't focus.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,360
Hey! If you have a crush on me, just don't be so obvious about it.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,300
This is too obvious.

39
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,840
I am sorry.

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
Four times ten equals 40.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
What about four times nine?

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
Oh, four times nine…

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,620
I am confused now. I already passed it.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,600
Who is that kid reciting multiplication tables?

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,080
Not a kid, mom. That's Noey.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,540
What?

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,820
Four times four equals 40.

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,140
Four times 11 equals 41.

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,880
I think it's 44.

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,980
Hey, just a small mistake. Big deal!

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,160
Oh, it's fine. Fighting!

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,120

He couldn't be a good student for long.

74
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,500
As expected, he didn't want to study.

75
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,020
Usually, he would threaten or force me to do it.

But he doesn't do so this time.

167
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,040
Let's go to Wortor Dorm! Let's go to Wortor Dorm!

168
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,560
Let's go!

169
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,300
Fight them, yeah!

170
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,580
- Let's go!
- Hey!

171
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,400
Kid, do you know that Wortor Dorm?

172
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,860
It's the college.

173
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,420
Yeah! That should be right.

174
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,940
Do you know its full name?

175
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,540
It's Bangpien College.

176
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,340
To Bangpien College, please.

177
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,560
Why did you stop here?

178
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,420
Over there!

179
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,080
You can drop me here.

180
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,660
- How much?
- It's okay.

181
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,420
Just take it.

182
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,700
Take it, please.

183
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,780
Where is he?

184
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
Excuse me.

185
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,720
Well…

186
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,900
Are there…

187
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,940
Are there people fighting around here?

188
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,640
Huh?

189
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,440
I am looking for my brother.

190
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,800
He's around this tall.

191
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
And his hair style is like this.

192
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,220
He has some bangs like this,

193
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,400
And looks a bit like a gangster.

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Well, not just a bit.

195
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,160
And what about his outfit?

196
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,780
He's wearing jeans with orange,

197
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,260
And a blue striped floral shirt.

198
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,960
He just got here a few minutes ago. Well…

199
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,500
I am not sure.

200
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,560
Whether this is in front of the building or behind the building.

201
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,561
But… there should be an old red motorcycle parked there.

202
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,520
Did you see it?

203
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,720
Well…

204
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,120
Oh!

205
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,700
I have no idea.

206
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,740
Damn it! What a waste of time!

207
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,200
Hello.

208
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Hello, Nid Nhoi.

209
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
Who is this?

210
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,900
It's me, Thi. Tutor Thi.

211
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,700
Thi and Noey!

212
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,680
Thi and Noey?

213
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh, right, Thi.

214
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,840
Look. Now, I have something urgent!

215
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,460
I am looking for Noey.

216
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,040
He skipped your class?

217
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,640
Well, not really.

218
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,580
Do you perhaps know…

219
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,940
If Noey came to Bangpian College, where would he go?

220
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,900
Normally, if he goes there…

221
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,960
He will go for ice cream.

222
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,040
Huh?

223
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Come again?

224
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,360
Can you say it again?

225
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,040
He always goes there to eat ice cream behind Dorm Two.

226
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,280
Behind Dorm Two,

227
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,140
for Ice cream?

228
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,520
- Just ice cream?
- Yes.

229
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,960
Okay.

230
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,460
I won't bother you now.

231
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,920
- Thank you.
- Sure.

232
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,840
Incredible!

233
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,380
Yum.

234
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,380
Very fresh.

235
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,460
- Noey.
- We don't get to eat it that often.

236
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,140
Wait, what?

237
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,740
Thi!

238
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
You are late.

239
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,240
What's going on?

240
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,720
- You guys…
- How about the fight?

241
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,840
You got scammed!

242
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,760
- Scammed?
- Yeah, it means you've been fooled.

243
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,860
You mean I've been fooled?

244
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,120
It's our Boss's plan. Awesome, right?

245
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,480
Coconut Milk Ice cream.

246
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,420
I promised that I would treat you one.

247
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,220
Huh?

248
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,600
If you do a great job,

249
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,880
I will…

250
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,140
- I will buy you Coconut Milk Ice cream.
- Huh?

251
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,220
I'm doing the best I can to persuade you.

252
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,880
You have to come and wait at this time.

253
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,160
If you come too early, he won't be here.

254
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,700
But if you come too late, you will miss it.

255
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,560
Hey! Hurry up and take it. It's melting now.

256
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,700
I ate this one already.

257
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,040
Do you want mine?

258
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,160
Geez…

259
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,700
You're really something.

260
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,560
You try in every way!

261
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,740
Damn!

262
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,240
Huh?

263
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,280
Over there! You have to wait in line.

264
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,160
If you want some, just hurry up!

265
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,660
And tell him that… Noey Watphlu'll pay for it.

266
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,960
If you're late, I won't wait.

267
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Hurry up!

268
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,200
Come on!

269
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,440
All right. What's wrong with him?

270
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,840
♫ So many stars in the sky ♫

271
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,540
♫ But there's always only you in my eyes ♫

272
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:25,620
♫ But you haven't noticed me at all ♫

273
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,440
You're so lucky. That Noey brought you here.

274
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,920
Besides the girl he likes, Nid Nhoi is the only girl he brought here.

275
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,440
No one else will ever get this chance.

276
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,160
Hurry up and eat. Are you waiting for it to melt and drink it?

277
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,560
I am eating it now.

278
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,246
How is it?

279
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:59,420
- Delicious?
- Delicious!

280
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,400
I love it!

281
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,760
Good! I'm glad you like it.

282
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,340
I will bring you here some other time.

283
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,600
Hey! If you want some more, just get in line again.

284
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,640
Our boss is very generous today.

285
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,260
I think you want it yourself.

286
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,660
Oh, you know me well. What are you waiting for? Just go!

287
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,140
I'll have one more, please. With a lot of sticky rice.

288
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,080
Uncle, I'll have the same one. One more cup with all toppings!

289
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,680
Big size, please.

290
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Hey! It's your third cup already. You still want more?

291
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,740
I come this far. You pay for it so I should get the best out of this.

292
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,520
What a greedy eater.

293
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,640
So… that kid at the temple and a motorcycle taxi, they know everything?

294
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,861
- What about the blood ?
- Looks real. Right?

295
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:04,960
This is a grenadine.

296
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
That's right.

297
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,660
How did you know that I would come?

298
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,060
What is that? Breast?

299
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,380
A heart! Trust.

300
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,380
Oh…

301
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,100
Why did you do that for?

302
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,780
What? To prove that...

303
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,140
Well… nothing! We just do it for fun.

304
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,640
- Really?
- Yeah, it is.

305
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh?

306
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,300
Tutor!

307
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Come here.

308
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,340
Where are we going?

309
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,980
Oh, you're ready to study now?

310
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,160
Where should we go?

311
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,440
Just get on the bike.

312
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,860
I will take you there. Don't ask too much.

313
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,740
Hey, I have to go now. See you.

314
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,180
Bye.

315
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,000
See you, dude.

316
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,800
Hurry up!

317
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,480
Why do I have to repeat myself? Are you deaf?

318
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,060
Where is he going? How could he just leave me here?

319
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,520
You're so picky.

320
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Take it!

321
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,780
Hey…

322
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,580
I won't put it on for you.

323
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,941
Put it on! Don't just hold it like that! Or do you want a cooking pot?

324
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,980
Okay, okay.

325
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,680
Well…

326
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,500
Whose helmet is this?

327
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,480
I gave it to you. That means it's yours.

328
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,960
But who did you take it from?

329
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,900
You didn't steal it. Right?

330
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,040
Do you think I am that kind of person?

331
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,480
Not at all!

332
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,880
Noey Watphlu is a nice, righteous kid.

333
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Noey! Noey!

334
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,860
Can you drive slowly, please? I have a fear of speed.

335
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,500
Woah! Are you teasing me?

336
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,160
You bumped into me too hard.

337
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,960
Are you taking advantage of me?

338
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,000
Geez…

339
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,860
Let's go.

340
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,420
♫ Destiny inspires and leads ♫

341
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,320
♫ Letting us meet immediately ♫

342
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,940
♫ Before this, we lived very far away from each other ♫

343
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,560
Slowly, please!

344
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,790
I said slowly!

345
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,500
I need to hang on to you like this.

346
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,300
Please don't think too much of it.

347
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,600
You told me that, but you hang on to me very tight.

348
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,120
You never understand what I say!

349
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,100
Your heart is beating so hard. How can I stop thinking?

350
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,680
Hey! Slow down, Noey.

351
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,960
That's too fast.

352
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,880
♫ Even if we live far away, we won't miss each other ♫

353
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,980
What do you mean?

354
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,240
This is your dorm. I'm dropping you off here.

355
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,980
Get off. Or do you want to go with me?

356
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,960
♫ If I was not a real spouse ♫

357
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,030
♫ How much more would I secretly love you? ♫

358
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,200
♫ It's very difficult to be satisfied ♫

359
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,100
Just keep it.

360
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,220
You need to wear it every time. Right?

361
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,960
I don't want to find a new one for you.

362
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,580
Not every time!

363
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,920
And on your way back,

364
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,780
You could use it, too.

365
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,260
For safety.

366
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,120
You are really worried about me, huh?

367
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,060
You keep flirting with me.

368
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,300
Well… I'll keep it then.

369
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,460
I might wear it often.

370
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
Thank you very much.

371
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,200
I really like this helmet.

372
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,660
Goodbye then.

373
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,360
Wait.

374
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,040
You're really not going to invite me to your room?

375
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,500
Well…

376
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,560
It's okay.

377
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,140
I don't mind.

378
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,540
Well, I have to…

379
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,600
do the laundry and other things.

380
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,260
I can do it.

381
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,720
You don't have to help me.

382
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,740
It's okay.

383
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,840
Do you want some coffee?

384
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,780
I can boil some water for you.

385
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,800
I think I can't open the door.

386
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,220
In that case, do you want me to break the door down?

387
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,180
Oh, I can open it now.

388
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
It's very dark in here.

389
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,300
You can wait outside though.

390
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,600
Move.

391
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,920
You live alone. Right?

392
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,040
Sometimes my friends come to hang out.

393
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,680
They like to sleep so we are cramped up together.

394
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,240
But this place is small, so there is not enough space.

395
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,220
I need to go down and do my laundry.

396
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,440
Hey, are you crazy?

397
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,980
How can you wash your clothes with hangers like that?

398
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,800
Oh, so I can just hang them right away.

399
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,840
Why? It's not okay?

400
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,250
That's funny.

401
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,940
Wait. That day I…

402
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,160
Gave it a new name. Noey Watphlu the Jerk!

403
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,160
I'm screwed. He must see it for sure.

404
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,280
- Noey the Jerk?
- There you go.

405
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,500
It's a cute name.

406
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,140
Are you making fun of me?

407
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,240
No, no!

408
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,280
Wait!

409
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,880
I am not making fun of you at all.

410
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,660
You are moving too close, kid…

411
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,760
What… are… you… doing?

412
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,760
♫ Just by looking into your eyes, they change something in my heart ♫

413
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,760
♫ My heart trembles ♫

414
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,680
♫ Every night and every day ♫

415
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,880
♫ I still keep thinking of you ♫

416
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,380
This hair style… suits your face well.

417
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,420
It's cute. You look cute.

418
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,240
Hey, look at these bangs.

419
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,800
Your hair is falling.

420
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,140
Overall, it is perfect.

421
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,920
Incredible.

422
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,457
He looks very happy.

423
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,500
When he teases me.

424
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,500
I'll have one Pink Milk, please.

425
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,360
Please wait a moment.

426
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,840
- Here you go.
- Hey, you pay for it.

427
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,320
The host should pay. Right?

428
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,500
Cool, yeah? His hair style looks cool. Right?

429
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,160
Very stylish.

430
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,080
I told you.

431
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,460
Hurry up.

432
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,260
Go ahead.

433
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,903
- You want to come too?
- No, thanks.

434
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:14,583
Go ahead.

435
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,140
Hey, what are you embarrassed about?

436
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,620
It's weird!

437
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,980
Weird?

438
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,660
Everyone had this hair style in the past.

439
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,860
That was in the past!

440
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,501
Well, now I'm still doing it. Right?

441
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:40,060
That's Noey Watphlu, not Tutor Thi.

442
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,120
Who could be that stylish?

443
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,420
Hey, hey.

444
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,540
Do you have something in mind?

445
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Just speak your mind.

446
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,100
I just want to know how hard it is to wash.

447
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,060
That's all.

448
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,660
If you are that worried,

449
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,360
I can wash it for you.

450
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,840
Huh?

451
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,960
You crazy!

452
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,640
By the way, you didn't tutor me today.

453
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,180
You just realized that?

454
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,320
What do you want to teach me?

455
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,440
Nine times eight.

456
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,680
Seventy-two.

457
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,580
Seven times six.

458
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,500
Forty-two.

459
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,660
- Twelve times three.
- Thirty-six.

460
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,423
Wow, you are getting better.

461
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,200
- Fourteen times twelve?
- It's 168.

462
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,820
- How about seventeen times eighteen?
- It's 306.

463
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,180
- And twenty-one times thirty-four?
- It's 714.

464
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,840
Hey!

465
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,000
Anything more difficult than this?

466
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,260
Quiz me any tables, Thi.

467
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,500
- You can join my gang.
- Huh?

468
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,200
What?

469
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,280
From now on, you are…

470
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,540
I am…

471
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,460
Don't tell me…

472
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,660
Thi Watphlu.

473
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,380
Thi Watphlu?

474
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,360
What will happen to me next?

475
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,240
I'm just his tutor.

476
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,140
No. I don't want to be Thi Watphlu.

477
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,700
No!

478
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,800
[Director: Weerachit Thongjila]

479
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,100
You guys didn't know. Right?

480
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,700
- I joined the Watphlu Gang already.
- What?

481
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,661
- Thi Watphlu.
- Will it be okay, Noey? You let that kind of person join the gang.

482
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:43,520
He's all brain, no strength. I don't think he will make it.

483
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,320
It's something new for our gang. Should be fun.

484
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,140
Hey. Are you going to get the helmet?

485
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,540
The temple again?

486
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,601
Take it off. Get off.

487
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:52,920
Hurry up.

488
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,360
Ouch!

489
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,860
Hey! Was it that loud?

490
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,861
You're overreacting. We are in a religious ceremony.

491
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,960
You're overreacting. We are in a religious ceremony.

492
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,561
Where are you going now? Huh?

493
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,960
I am hungry.

494
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,881
We can go after we're done with this. Okay?

495
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:07,760
Just do as I say, so you won't be in trouble.

496
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,940
No, I can't dance.

497
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,040
I am not good at it.

498
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,840
If you don't dance, I will make you walk around until you do.

499
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,300
Now, you must pay attention to the things in front of you.

500
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,640
Ready?

501
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,820
That kid?

502
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,220
What did you gain from tutoring him?

503
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,900
Why didn't you quit? Just stay away from him.

504
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,900
I really wish I could.

505
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,480
But his mom already paid for it.

506
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,240
And I already promised that I will tutor him.

507
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,090
♫ Destiny inspires and leads ♫

508
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:04,140
♫ Letting us meet immediately ♫

509
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,170
♫ Before this, we lived very far away from each other,
destiny controlled our hearts ♫

510
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:14,210
♫ So I moved closer to you ♫

511
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,260
♫ Destiny determines everything ♫

512
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,310
♫ And sets the path for everyone ♫

513
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,360
♫ One's life is destined, making soulmates meet each other ♫

514
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,400
♫ Which it has bestowed you to me ♫

515
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,520
♫ One's life is destined, making soulmates meet each other ♫

516
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,810
♫ Which it has bestowed you to me ♫

517
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:51,600
