00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,880
I will make you proud of me.

164
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,020
Ouch… be gentle. It hurts.

165
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,140
Noey, my wound.

166
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,320
Sorry. My bad.

167
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't worry.

168
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,000
Aren't you going to have some of my birthday cake?

169
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,580
- Yeah, I'm going to eat it right now.
- Go ahead.

170
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
That's right.

171
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,300
You'll get a daughter-in-law as your birthday gift.

172
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,540
You can do as you please when you become an adult. No one can say anything,

173
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,420
as long as you don't cause trouble.

174
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,240
Yes, Auntie Tim. I got it.

175
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,740
I'm digging in. Let's see.

176
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,820
- Oh! It's good.
- Of course it's good. I didn't bake it.

177
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,480
Why didn't he carry his phone with him?

178
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,920
Hey! It took you long enough to answer.

179
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,800
I'm busy.

180
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,080
- You're with your parents, right?
- Yeah.

181
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,940
I understand. I won't bother you anymore.

182
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,080
But I'll see you at the university, then.

183
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,980
That's all. Bye.

184
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,220
Hey… If you're worried about me,

185
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,020
don't be.

186
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,380
I'm going to find a way to win over your parents.

187
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,760
And this…

188
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,260
please tell your parents to try this.

189
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,620
I made it with all my efforts.

190
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,780
Smells good.

191
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,520
Maybe you should taste it first?

192
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,900
Hey! Use a spatula and put it in a spoon.

193
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,920
Okay.

194
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,580
Hey! It's salty enough.

195
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,060
You add fish sauce again.

196
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,760
Do you dare to eat it?

197
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,460
Well, he tasted it and it was good.

198
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,950
Take it.

199
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,140
Tell you parents that they can feel free to enjoy the food.

200
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,580
As for you, just focus on your studies.

201
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,800
This is your last year.

202
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,090
You're graduating soon.

203
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,640
Fighting, Thi.

204
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,660
Too bad I'm still in eleventh grade.

205
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,900
When I'm a freshman, you will have already graduated.

206
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,380
But… I'm going to try my best to get into this university.

207
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,740
If I can study in the same university as you,

208
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,740
I can prove to your parents that I can be good, too.

209
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,940
And… I'll ask my mom if I can move into your dorm with you.

210
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,300
I'll pay the rent. You'll pay for the insurance.

211
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,500
I'll pay the water bill.

212
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,560
You'll pay the electricity bill.

213
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,060
But no matter what, you'll still have to tutor me.

214
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,320
I trust you.

215
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,420
You're the best tutor, Thi.

216
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:54,180
Never leave, never run away, never give up tutoring, or…

217
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,140
What's your policy again?

218
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,700
What policy?

219
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,660
It's my slogan.

220
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,260
I'll never leave, never run away,never give in and give up tutoring.

221
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,360
Yeah, that one.

222
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,620
The truth is…

223
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,620
If you have something on your mind, you can tell me.

224
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,400
I will be a good listener.

225
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,100
Well…

226
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,680
Should I tell him now?

227
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,780
Will it… dash his hopes?

228
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,040
After finishing my senior year here,

229
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,360
my parents want me to go live in Chiangmai,

230
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,020
and pursue a master's degree there.

231
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,540
It seems like I can't live with you.

232
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,520
He's not upset about it at all?

233
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,980
Or he's trying to hide his true feelings?

234
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,500
Good for you, Thi.

235
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,180
Don't you worry.

236
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,820
I'll follow you there.

237
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,180
No matter where you go,

238
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,480
no matter how far,

239
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,380
I will follow you.

240
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,620
I made that promise to you.

241
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,940
Chiangmai isn't that far away.

242
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,700
Only about 10 hours drive away.

243
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,620
It takes only an hour if you fly there.

244
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,960
He probably doesn't know.

245
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm also planning to buy more of this pendant.

246
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,740
That one will be yours. So it will be a couple pendant.

247
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,020
And another one for Auntie Tim.

248
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,800
Back then, you said that Chiangmai was very far.

249
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,720
You said you'll buy it from Sampeng.

250
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,500
You troublemaker.

251
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,460
Oh, and which university are you going to?

252
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,980
In case I can get in.

253
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,000
He's really going to follow me there? That's crazy!

254
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,740
Thi!

255
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,940
Huh?

256
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,300
I was asking which university will you be studying at in Chiangmai?

257
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,980
Let me try the soup.

258
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,140
- Well?
- Well?

259
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,560
Wow.

260
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,440
This is pretty good, son.

261
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,480
Where did you buy it from?

262
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,640
Mom, try this.

263
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,090
Wow, very delicious.

264
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,700
You should take us to this restaurant before we return to Chiangmai.

265
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,440
It's quite different. The packaging is very cute, too.

266
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,540
Eat up, son.

267
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:26,680
You guys go ahead.

268
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,603
I have it regularly.

269
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,600
- Look at these big shrimps.
- Noey's cooking…

270
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,500
I always like it.

271
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,580
Do you think your son will be accepted into university?

272
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,620
Do you want my honest answer or a fake one?

273
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,840
An honest one.

274
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,680
Of course you can.

275
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,060
Noey Watphlu can achieve anything if he puts his mind to it.

276
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,360
I read my books 10 times and I can never remember anything,

277
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,560
but seeing your face once, and I can never forget it.

278
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,020
Geez, I'm not sure about getting accepted now.

279
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,640
- Even if I can't get in,
- Huh?

280
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,860
getting in his heart is enough for me.

281
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,240
Jesus! My head hurts.

282
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,180
My wound also hurts. I'm out of here.

283
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,200
♫ I think of you every day that I'm tired ♫

284
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:51,920
♫ Even though the sky is far away, I'm still waiting to meet you ♫

285
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,840
Do this one like that one, follow the example.

286
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,420
What are you looking at?

287
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,680
Just study hard!

288
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Or you won't pass the exams.

289
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:21,040
♫ I still remember the day I met you ♫

290
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,420
- Bye-bye, Thi.
- Yes, bye. Get home safely.

291
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,820
♫ Making my heart still dream about you in my dreams ♫

292
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:37,680
Honestly, I still don't know what are we.

293
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,500
You can't stop staring at me, Thi?

294
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,460
Even though we've been together for a while now.

295
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,400
He just keeps talking nonsense, my troublemaker.

296
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,980
What was that in my head?

297
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,120
My troublemaker?

298
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,600
That means I think...

299
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,960
he belongs to me now?

300
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,140
No.

301
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,000
I can't think that way.

302
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,620
Hey, you!

303
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,760
What's wrong with me?

304
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,440
What the heck are you thinking, Thi?

305
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,220
- Hey!
- Huh?

306
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,520
What is it?

307
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,820
What's wrong?

308
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,340
Oh, it's nothing.

309
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,000
I was just… enjoying the view.

310
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,700
♫ When you're so far away ♫

311
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,360
Everywhere feels special, when you're with me. Right?

312
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,420
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,220
Hey! That's not it!

314
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,340
You're acting suspicious.

315
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,520
You've fallen in love with me, huh?

316
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,760
Falling so deep, you can't come out?

317
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,140
Damn it. My heart is trembling.

318
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,680
I'm so sick and tired of your face.

319
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,360
We already decided to be together, and you still have to butt in.

320
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,440
We already decided to be together, and you still have to butt in.

321
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,380
Wait a minute, Noey!

322
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,640
Whoever wins gets to drop off Thi.

323
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,180
Did you ask him who he wants to go home with?

324
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,840
Go ahead and tell him, Thi.

325
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,800
What does your heart say?

326
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,980
I can go home by myself.

327
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,000
Then, let's get it over with. So I can take Thi home.

328
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,840
Trust me.

329
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,220
Cheer me on, will you?

330
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,700
Well, fighting.

331
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,960
I'll give it my all.

332
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,080
Trust me.

333
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,180
You can go first.

334
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's see what you got.

335
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,680
You want to fight?

336
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,700
Do you know what time it is?

337
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,280
I'll call you back. I'm watching a movie.

338
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,800
Huh? What did you just say?

339
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
How could you go watch a movie with him? Who said you can go?

340
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,540
Be quiet, Noey.

341
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm giving you 10 minutes.

342
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,900
Come back now.

343
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,560
Or I'll go there and drag you out myself.

344
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,740
I'm behind your dorm.

345
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,440
Hurry up.

346
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,920
You don't need to feel neglected.

347
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,600
I had more fun watching a movie with you.

348
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,720
He won't budge.

349
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,900
A little movement.

350
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,120
He's dreaming of dancing at an ordination ceremony or what?

351
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,380
Have you thought about changing your hairstyle?

352
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,920
Hey, Thi.

353
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,980
Thi!

354
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,760
What a sleepyhead.

355
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,280
The sound of you snoring is the best sound on earth.

356
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,620
You look so cute even when your sleeping.

357
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,640
How can I not fall for you?

358
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,680
Do you know that my heart is beating so fast right now?

359
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm going to try my best to be with you there.

360
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,220
I'm going to get accepted.

361
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,500
I will make that happen… for you.

362
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,060
Thank you for always being by my side,

363
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,440
even though I treated you badly in the past.

364
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,100
I realize who will always be there for me.

365
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,600
It has always been you.

366
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,160
Thiwa, my love.

367
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,020
One person is sleeping while another one is awake.

368
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,820
It goes on and on like this.

369
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,680
Will they wake up and see each other's faces tonight?

370
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,160
Nid Nhoi.

371
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,880
Help me, please.

372
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,700
Here. You have to substitute that with this first.

373
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,020
Hey, you can ask me if you have any questions.

374
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,720
If you don't understand anything, just tell me and I'll help you.

375
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,740
Hey, Thi, the song is over. It's over, Thi.

376
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,240
- Huh?
- Stop recording.

377
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,760
Okay, okay, okay.

378
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,160
Recently, Noey's really studying hard.

379
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,440
Yeah, I got it.

380
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,740
He's so focused that…

381
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,060
I completely forgot that he used to be a delinquent.

382
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,260
Watphlu gang's fighting activity has come to an end.

383
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,860
They turned into nerds.

384
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,800
I'm no longer the leader of Watphlu gang.

385
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,120
You guys don't have to do this.

386
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,520
And despite Noey disbanding his gang,

387
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,840
everyone is still by his side.

388
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,860
Thanks a lot.

389
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,920
except… Thiw Watphlu,

390
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,560
the person Noey wants to remain by his side.

391
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,860
Fighting, Noey.

392
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,600
This tastes hella good!

393
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,200
I wish I had someone to cook for me like this every day.

394
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,780
You can order a gas tank from me.

395
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,730
I'll give you fried rice for free.

397

400

You still remember what I taught you last time. Right?

401
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,980
No, I remember it by heart.

402
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,720
See?

403
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,320
Gang fights no longer exists.

404
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,420
Great job, my troublemaker.

405
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,020
Time flies, don't you think?

406
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,400
Yeah, right?

407
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,500
The day you leave,

408
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,600
let me see you off. Okay?

409
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,260
I don't want to be so far away from you.

410
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,020
I want you to stay here.

411
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,720
I thought you said you would go visit?

412
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,440
Yes, of course.

413
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,100
I'll visit you.

414
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,800
But I'll have to get through twelfth grade without you for a whole year.

415
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,840
How am I going to survive?

416
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Easy-peasy.

417
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
If you miss me, just call me.

418
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,280
That's for sure.

419
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,380
But… I just want you to be by my side.

420
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,740
I'll come down to Bangkok during school break.

421
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,400
Gosh!

422
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,540
One semester is so long.

423
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,000
Just kill me already.

424
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,680
And who's going to tutor me?

425
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,820
I don't want anyone else.

426
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,680
We can do it online.

427
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,400
I'll charge 1,000 baht per hour.

428
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
Huh?

429
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,180
Online?

430
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,480
How does it work? And…

431
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,620
And why is it so expensive?

432
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,180
Well, it's… a surcharge for missing you.

433
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Then, I'll pay you 100,000 baht.

434
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,800
Just because… I'll miss you so much.

435
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,060
Can I hold your hand?

436
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,920
Well, this is nice.

437
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,680
Can I kiss you?

438
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,900
I'll take a raincheck on that.

439
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,500
I can wait until I graduate.

440
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,500
Answer the phone, Thi.

441
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,720
Don't make your mom wait.

442
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,980
Hello, Mom.

443
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,320
Yes.

444
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,220
Yes, of course.

445
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,420
Okay.

446
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,140
The day I have to move out…

447
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,680
my parents are coming to pick me up.

448
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,200
That's good.

449
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,080
So you don't have to travel alone.

450
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,120
It would be too lonely.

451
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,700
- But then you would…
- I won't see you off then.

452
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,380
I hate waking up early, you know.

453
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,900
Just let me know when you get there, then.

454
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,200
My tutor.

455
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,080
Up until now…

456
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,620
thank you so much for tutoring me.

457
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,220
Yeah.

458
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,800
Not on school subjects though,

459
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,300
I meant the love subject.

460
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,400
You played Pam's part really well.

461
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm going back to flirt with the real Pam now.

462
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,460
[Director: Weerachit Thongjila]

463
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,740
We'll go and visit you. Okay?

464
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,020
Safe travels. Let us know when you get there.

465
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,560
- We will miss you for sure.
- Geez, this is awkward.

466
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,320
- We will miss you for sure.
- Geez, this is awkward.

467
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,500
You're really going to leave things like this?

468
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,400
The end of the alley. Tomorrow. You want to go with me?

469
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,140
A comeback for Noey Watphlu.

470
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,920
No, it's Noey going solo, because you left your old gang.

471
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,720
And what can I do, Sis?

472
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,660
There are many ways to do things.

473
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,900
First off, go back and talk to Thiw.

474
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,160
The second thing is to follow your heart.

475
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,540
It's easier said than done, Waew.

476
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,660
I have no future. What they said is true.

477
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,320
I never thought it would turn out like this.

478
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,180
It's because of me.

479
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,360
If you really have good intentions,

480
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,260
you should let him go to better his future.

481
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:12,380
But before I die from heartache,

482
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,280
I want to see you one more time.
