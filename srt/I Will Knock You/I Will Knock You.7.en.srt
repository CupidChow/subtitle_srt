1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,018
- You guys don't know, right? I already joined Watphlu gang.
- Huh?

2
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:05,001
Thi Watphlu.

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,780
Do you think he'll be okay? Letting him join our Watphlu gang,

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,360
- That's not going to work.
- It's something new.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,440
Just hold onto me tight. I'm okay.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,600
The temple again?

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,680
No, I don't know how to dance.

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,043
I am not good at it.

9
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:18,963
You did a great job, Bouncy man.

10
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:21,640
Awesome!

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,521
Hurry up!

12
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,560
Geez…

13
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,400
We can't steal the shoes from the temple.

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,620
I can't answer it for you.

15
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,640
You have to remember it yourself and answer that to the teacher.

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,500
You're good at beating around the bush.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,900
He knows how to behave as well.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,400
If you ask me what kind of person Noey Watphlu is,

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,200
I would say that it depends on each day.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,680
He might have seven to nine different emotions per day.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,260
It's just hard to guess.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,920
Sometimes he seems gentle.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,100
Sometimes he seems very scary.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,520
See? He always looks fierce.

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,880
And now, he is in a good boy mode.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,260
Damn it!

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,100
So damn difficult! What kind of question is this?

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,200
It's too hard to understand.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,460
I quit.

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,420
Tomorrow, I will have my class representative copy it for me.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,280
Huh?

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,100
No more good boy mode.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,000
How fast.

34
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,140

Noey.

46
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,540
Don't force me. I already tried hard enough today.

47
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,200
No, it's not that.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,360
Do you mind taking me to the temple that we went to yesterday?

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,960
If it troubles you, you can just tell me the temple's name.

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,980
I already forgot.

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,080
But I can go there by myself.

52
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,560
Just tell me.

Tell me now.

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,900
I came here to return the sandals.

55
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,440
That's it?

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,680
I feel better now.

We can separate now.

I can go back by myself.

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,860
Up to you.

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,960
Hey, you!

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,550
Did you take the temple's sandals?

63
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,580
Oh, I just borrowed them. I returned them already.

64
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,580
- Give me 500 baht for the rent.
- Five hundred?

65
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:31,740
It's only 500 baht. Don't be sticky!

66
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,800
Give us the money!

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,060
Otherwise, I will tell the monk that you stole them.

68
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,380
You will pay us 500 baht or do you want to pay the police 2,000 baht?

69
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,220
What do you want?

70

Okay, okay.

I am sorry. I will pay.

00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:55,560

Wait!

Please don't do anything to me.

82

Hey.

Hey! Noey Watphlu.

Go!

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,540
Put them on him.

88
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,200
Do it.

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Sure.

90
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,420
You're putting them on the wrong feet.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,700
Sorry about that.

92
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,440

Both of you.

94

Apologize to him.

95
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,260
We are sorry.

96
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,700
Don't you guys see who's with him?

97
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,480
If you bother him again,

98
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,980
we'll see.

99
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,940
We're sorry. It won't happen anymore.

100
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,580
Let's go.

101
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,260
How can I leave you?

102
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,980
Watphlu never leaves anyone behind.

103
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,960
Especially you.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,880
Let's go back.

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Geez.

106
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,800
You're scared, aren't you?

107
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,360
Any dirt?

108
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,960
Hey, you.

109
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,820
Do you know?

110
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,380
Not every boy in the temple will be as nice,

111
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,740
as handsome, and as cool as Noey Watphlu.

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,180
At first, I wanted to thank you.

113
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,020
But now, I just feel annoyed.

114
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,180
What kind of person… can be this narcissistic?

115
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
As much as you like me?

116
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,900
Or maybe more?

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
Huh?

118
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,680
Should I be all red?

119
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Well,

120
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,940
you can go ahead and be all red like an actress.

121
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,580
It's up to you.

122
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,600
Wow, so cool.

123
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,720
Aren't you afraid of falling now?

124
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,760
Oh, not so much now.

125
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,500
It's fine.

126
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,800
Maybe I have to speed up.

127
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,680
So you will have an excuse to hold onto my waist.

128
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,880
Huh?

129
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,040
No!

130
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,460
Slowly, please.

131
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,140
Go easy on me.

132
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,440
Slowly!

133
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
No…

134
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,540
We're here.

135
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,520
That's enough.

136
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,100
Get down.

137
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,140
Great. Let's get your homework done then.

138
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,560
Who told you that?

139
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, why did you bring me back here then?

140
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
I just want to bring you back here.

141
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,240
You can go anywhere you want.

142
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,580
I just want to come here alone.

143
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,380
Wasn't it you? The one who followed me here.

144
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,180
Did I ask you to come?

145
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,220
Hey, you're not going to give me some space?

146
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,360
You're so…

147
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,320
Just like that?

148
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,920
I will go back then.

149
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,560
But…

150
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,660
Thank you for taking me to return the sandals.

151
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,420
And for helping me.

152
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,120
Hey!

153
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,900
Do you think Pam will like this...

154
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,240
if I give this to her?

155
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,880
To share my merit with her.

156
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,040
What do you think?

157
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,620
You know Pam more than I do.

158
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,540
Do you think Pam will take it or not?

159
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,440
Suddenly, I want to help him.

160
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,700
Even if the chance that Pam will like it.

161
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,360
Might be zero.

162
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,960
Sharing his merit?

163
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,260
Last time, he gave her the lotus.

164
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,400
How could he think of these?

165
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
I think it's possible.

166
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Do you think so?

167
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,480
Really?

168
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,080
Yeah…

169
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm glad I woke up early.

170
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,500
Well, should we go now? Maybe she is still at school.

171
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,700
Let's go.

172
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,020
Hey, wait!

173
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,180
It's evening already.

174
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,860
Maybe we can go another day.

175
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,660
I think she might be back home by now.

176
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,270
Hey...

177
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,140
I feel very restless right now.

178
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,220
Just relax.

179
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,340
If you were me, could you be?

180
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,900
Right now…

181
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,160
I think I have a chance, just like what you said.

182
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,660
Do you want to practice?

183
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,060
What did you say?

184
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,520
I will be Pam.

185
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,460
And you try flirting with me.

186
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,140
First of all, can I ask you something?

187
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,540
Why do you like Pam so much?

188
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,700
And… you really must know that to help me?

189
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,780
Yeah.

190
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,080
It's the character details.

191
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,060
So I can be immersed in it.

192
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,240
Well, you will be the first one to know.

193
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,900
That day, I saw a girl.

194
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,220
Was that girl Pam?

195
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,260
That's just my guess.

196
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,400
All right, go on.

197
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,860
That girl was Pam.

198
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,160
I learned her name after that.

199
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,720
I guess you learned her name from O, right?

200
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,700
Connecting the dots.

201
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,940
Do you want to tell the story yourself?

202
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,440
Huh?

203
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,580
You can continue. I won't interrupt.

204
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,700
She was holding a lotus and pressing her hands together.

205
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,020
Oh… the lotus.

206
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,690
I fell in love...

207
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,740
with all my heart.

208
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,250
Okay…

209
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,130
She was the first girl that

210
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,140
I fell in love with at first sight.

211
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,180
Hey!

212
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,340
What number?

213
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,980
One.

214
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,520
[Number One]

215
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,080
♪ Destiny brought us together ♪

216
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,320
♫ Leading us to meet suddenly ♫

217
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,500
I think it must be destiny.

218
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,540
Do you agree?

219
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,520
I agree to whatever you say.

220
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,820
♫ Destiny inspires and leads ♫

221
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,660
♫ Letting us meet immediately ♫

222
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,980
How should we begin then?

223
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,100
Okay, it looks similar.

224
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,180
Yeah.

225
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,140
All right! So you will be Pam.

226
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,640
And I will be Noey Watphlu.

227
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,860
Yeah, it should be like that.

228
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,060
It's because Noey Watphlu...

229
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,040
is so handsome,

230
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,000
smart, and cool.

231
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
I have to do it myself.

232
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,800
I'm the perfect fit.

233
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,060
Got it?

234
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,800
Now, give me your advice.

235
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,120
Well…

236
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,040
First of all,

237
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,260
when you're meeting Pam like this,

238
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,280
you might have to come alone.

239
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,420
Alone?

240
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,360
Yes.

241
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,160
Why?

242
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,120
So that you will be less scary.

243
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,360
Hey, which part of me is scary?

244
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,100
Every part.

245
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,560
If you appear as a gang,

246
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,880
it seems like you're about to kick someone's ass.

247
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,240
Everyone would be afraid of you.

248
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,280
How about you imagine that you were Pam?

249
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,600
You are a female student,

250
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,920
who's cute and tiny.

251
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
And then you see Noey Watphlu with the gang.

252
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They all look ruthless and even have weapons.

253
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,760
Imagine that…

254
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,640
You're Pam.

255
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,540
You're a female student,

256
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,240
who's cute and tiny.

257
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,480
And see Noey Watphlu with the gang.

258
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,960
He looks ruthless, but still handsome.

259
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,360
What kind of weapons do they have?

260
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,760
It's the knife used for cutting the lotus.

261
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
Watphlu gang.

262
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,680
Watphlu's angel gang.

263
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,140
The number of the members is almost the same.

264
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,080
There are too many.

265
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,680
It looks scary.

266
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Am I that scary?

267
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,680
Try reducing the number of people.

268
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,180
All right.

269
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,280
Hey, you guys can leave.

270
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm here to flirt with my girl.

271
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,560
So don't get in my way.

272
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,940
Hey, wait!

273
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,760
Give me the lotus.

274
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
Hey, you.

275
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,600
Your name is Pam. Right?

276
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,840
I really like your front bangs.

277
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,480
I'd love it if you could come and do my hair at my place.

278
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,540
Do you want to come?

279
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,780
Come and make my heart flutter.

280
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,961
Well…

281
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:18,080
That's why you gave the lotus to Pam. Right?

282
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,020
Yeah! The one you stepped on.

283
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,200
Oh, yeah.

284
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,570
I meant the lotus itself

285
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,540
doesn't convey love.

286
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,240
If you want to be clear, it should be…

287
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,420
roses or something like that.

288
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,140
It's the most popular.

Put it in the bag.

See? It works.

321
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,060

I can imagine.

326
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,900
People prefer roses nowadays.

327
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,040
It represents love.

328
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,760
What about this?

329
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,760
With this, you get merit too.

330
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,440
This is even worse than the lotus.

331
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,880
What?

332
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,840
Hey, you said earlier that she might like it.

333
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,880
Well… I said "might."

334
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:50,020
But... based on Pam's style,

335
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,320
it's…

336
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,320
What?

337
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,760
You can't make me lose hope again.

338
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
Or should we try making a bouquet?

339
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,340
A bouquet of roses?

340
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Here, try it.

341
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,680
Do it like this to imitate the real ones.

342
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,320
Like this.

343
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,040
- Where?
- The upper part.

344
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,540
Go on.

345
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,740
And don't make it too long.

346
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,901
Okay.

347
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,160
Wrapping it around.

348
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,080
That's enough. Cut it out.

349
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,420
And this paper,

350
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,660
Cut this part out.

351
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,740
- Like this.
- Yeah.

352
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,041
See? And then you make it tight.

353
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,920
Squeeze it?

354
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,880
- Grab this part and then squeeze it.
- Okay.

355
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,740
Make it into smaller ones.

356
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,780
Hold this.

357
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,040
This looks nice. Hey, this is really something.

358
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,960
See?

359
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,320
I think Pam will like it.

360
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,820
Right?

361
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,360
I love your idea.

362
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,300
See? It was made with your heart. She will definitely like it.

363
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,640
So she could see that we put in effort.

364
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,500
Yeah. Who made this?

365
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,160
Me.

366
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,460
All right.

367
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,240
His idea of this Ribbon Chick bouquet...

368
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
is brilliant.

369
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,880
Hey!

370
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,800
- For Pam.
- What are you doing?

371
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,420
I hope he likes it.

372
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,620
I hope you like it.

373
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,980
Pam, this is for you.

374
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,420
Was that okay?

375
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,580
- Yeah.
- Really?

376
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,160
Right.

377
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,560
I think Pam will like it.

378
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,660
For sure.

379
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,460
♫ No matter how long it takes ♫

380
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,900
♫ I'll wait for you ♫

381
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,680
He is quite alright.

382
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,840
♫ Even once ♫

383
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,600
♫ Even though it seems ♫

384
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,420
Who gave it to you?

385
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,201
- I did it by myself.
- Really?

386
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:27,660
Yeah.

387
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,000
You did it?

388
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Well, actually, someone helped me.

389
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,620
You mean your Thi?

390
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,140
You know too much now.

391
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,140
Is there something going on between you guys?

392
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,680
Hey! What did you say?

393
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,560
Who taught you that kind of phase?

394
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,540
It's you.

395
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,740
How poetic.

396
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,960
I'm going downstairs then.

397
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,600
Nid Nhoi.

398
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,960
Can you help me with something?

399
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,020
What do you want?

400
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,940
Hey, Sompong!

401
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,510
Copy the homework for Noey now.

402
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,820
Chop, chop please.

403
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,820
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

404
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,720
Hurry up!

405
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,480
What are you looking at? Want me to slap you? Hurry.

406
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,980
If you are late, you will get hurt.

407
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,620
He's finished his homework.

408
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,880
Huh?

409
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,980
Hey, Noey.

410
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:12,481
Who did it for you?

411
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:14,921
- I did it myself.
- Huh?

412
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,401
You did it yourself?

413
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,861
Yeah.

414
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:19,761
How's that possible?

415
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,121
Nid Nhoi taught me.

416
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:27,321
I told you so many times. You should remember it by now.

417
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:30,601
- It's a bit confusing.
- I'm confusing?

418
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:33,601
No, not that. I mean...

419
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,641
This homework is a bit confusing.

420
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:38,561
I mean just a tiny bit. Okay?

421
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,681
It's not that you're confusing.

422
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,001
Hurry up! I got my homework, too.

423
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:49,040
Okay.

424
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,980
This is weird. Suddenly, you do your own homework.

425
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:54,181
It's not like you at all.

426
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,601
Well, so he can be proud of me.

427
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,782
Huh? What was that?

428
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:05,361
I meant him. He will be happy.

429
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,461
Noey might…

430
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:38,681
have gone out to see Pam by now.

431
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:43,581
And I hope that Pam will open up a bit.

432
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:46,441
Excuse me. How can I do this one?

433
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,590
Well, I want to know how it goes too.

434
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,300
How come he doesn't call to update anything.

435
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,301
He doesn't carry his phone with him.

436
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,601
Unknown number?

437
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,701
Hello.

438
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:10,101
Hey, it's me. Come down now.

439
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,061
Thank you.

440
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,001
You came up into my mind.

441
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,641
I thought you could help.

442
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:41,561
So I came to see you.

443
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:43,881
Okay.

444
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:56,701
He looks a bit down.

445
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,381
It's done now.

446
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:02,981
Thank you.

447
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,081
I will find a way for you to get to know Pam.

448
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,341
I will teach you more about Pam.

449
00:34:18,941 --> 00:34:21,761
And love subjects for free.

450
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:23,661
Free of charge.

451
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,120
No matter how many times you get rejected,

452
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,740
you will keep fighting for her. Right?

453
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,581
I went there alone,

454
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:04,581
with a bouquet of flowers as you told me to.

455
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:15,621
I still couldn't win Pam's heart.

456
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:28,381
I really can't.

457
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:40,441
He tries to cheer me up?

458
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,581
Well.

459
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,481
Can I sleep over tonight?

460
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,721
Huh?

461
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:03,141
Seriously?

462
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,361
That's right.

463
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:10,681
Watphlu gang will not leave their members behind.

464
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:14,881
We need to be there for the gang when in need.

465
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,381
Let's go!

466
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,081
How can I leave you behind?

467
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:25,441
Watphlu gang won't leave anyone behind.

468
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:28,681
Grab my hand, Noey. Watphlu will stay together.

469
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:34,141
Huh? He will grab my hand later?

470
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:42,961
- Maybe later.
- Let me borrow your toothbrush. Okay?

471
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,021
What?

472
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:50,701
I will borrow your toothbrush.

473
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:56,740
Let's go. We can go and buy one.

474
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,580
[8 Mini Mart]

475
00:37:07,901 --> 00:37:11,181
A bottle of water is 7 baht each. The toothbrush is 35 baht. The snack is 10 baht.

476
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:14,081
And the sandwich is 10 baht for each. Total is 80 baht.

477
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:16,581
- Do you want a plastic bag?
- No.

478
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,701
Thank you.

479
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:28,521
It's 79 Baht, isn't it?

480
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:32,341
Two bottles of water are 14 baht.

481
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,961
The toothbrush is 35 baht.

482
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,441
The snack is 10 baht.

483
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:41,361
And the sandwich is 10 baht for each, two pieces for 20 baht.

484
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:43,541
So the total is 79 Baht.

485
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:47,161
Take back your 1 baht, Thi!

486
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,861
Hurry up!

487
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:53,881
His calculating skill is improving.

488
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:56,661
Take it.

489
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,941
I am so proud of him.

490
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:06,701
- What are you looking at?
- I am looking at a handsome guy.

491
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,581
- You see someone handsome?
- As if he could read my mind.

492
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,081
Yes.

493
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,001
Which way should I go? Lead the way.

494
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,321
It's over there.

495
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,001
Hey! I'll kick your ass.

496
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,541
I can't sleep.

497
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:39,141
Do you want to listen to some music? I can turn it on.

498
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:41,821
I can't listen to your songs.

499
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:47,681
Let's listen to yours, then. What song do you want to listen to?

500
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:51,001
"Destiny."

501
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:01,041
Do you believe in destiny?

502
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,721
Well…

503
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,761
We met in a strange way.

504
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:26,201
We made a promise in a strange way.

505
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,581
No, not really.

506
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:37,041
Why?

507
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,221
I don't know.

508
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:43,081
I think it's…

509
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:46,401
unreasonable.

Okay.

512
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,321
I found your song.

you are quite all right.

How?

518
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:22,161
Or maybe I should pursue you?

519
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:23,761
Huh?

520
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:34,341
Can you teach me about Thi instead?

521
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:37,901
I'm starting to want to study,

522
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:41,421
so I can study now.

523

Teaching love subjects with Noey Watphlu?

You are lucky, Thi.

You will have Noey Watphlu as your soulmate.

Thiw, can you help me with something?

530
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,261
- What's up, dude?
- I want to pursue…

531

Pam?

532
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,182
- My tutor.
- What?

533
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:16,621
I think he is really afraid of me.

534
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:20,461
Well, is there anything that a nerd can't do?

Nid Nhoi, my little sister.

Do you think there is anything that a nerd can't do?

537
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:27,021
He can't be a jerk like you.

538
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:28,441
Being a jerk like me?

539

- Being a jerk like us.

You have to look into the enemy's eyes. Don't avoid eye contact.

Go!

No, no.

Hey!

You really never let me down, Noey.

549
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:54,781
- Thank you, mom.
- I'm being sarcastic.

550
00:41:56,901 --> 00:42:00,141
If one day, Noey is too much to handle, you can tell me!

It's okay I'm fine for now, Auntie Tim.
