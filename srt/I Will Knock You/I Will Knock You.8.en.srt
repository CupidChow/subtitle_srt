00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,520
Go and help your friends!

167
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,140
Why are you just standing there?

168
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
Noey, I'm leaving now.

169
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,000
You did quite well. No injuries.

170
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
How could I have any?

171
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,660
I didn't do anything.

172
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
Come on. Let's go to my house.

173
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,920
Huh?

174
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,360
Hey, we're going to your house.

175
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,700
Sure. I'll ask my mom to fry some eggs.

176
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,680
Hold up. He's going to your house later?

177
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
Yeah.

178
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,520
I will be on my way, then.

179
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,080
Stop talking nonsense.

180
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,060
Have dinner first and then I'll drop you off.

181
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,420
No, no…

182
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,720
Hey!

183
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
Hey, Noey, wait up!

184
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,920
You never let me down, Noey.

185
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,240
Thanks, Mom.

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,360
It's not a compliment.

187
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,820
Nid Nhoi.

188
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,240
Give him some fish, dear.

189
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,480
It's out of my reach, Mom.

190
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,520
Again? It's out of your reach again?

191
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,000
Eat up so you'll be stronger.

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Huh?

193
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,880
♫ Every day, every time, I still miss you who are there ♫

194
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,700
Thank you for the meal.

195
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,420
You want me to feed you. Right?

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,820
It'd be too romantic. My mom is also here.

197
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,400
Don't be shy.

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,760
I can help myself. I'll do it.

199
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,900
Shall I feed you?

200
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
No need.

201
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,580
Just eat then.

202
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,140
Pick up the spoon, scoop the rice with some eggs, and open your mouth.

203
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,450
♫ Just a faint smile that fades every time we meet ♫

204
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,820
♫ But you can't change it ♫

205
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,640
How was it?

206
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,680
Noey!

207
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,380
Watch your tone when you're talking to Thi.

208
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,940
What's wrong with the way I talk?

209
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,640
Just look at his face.

210
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,760
Why? He looks very happy to me.

211
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,420
Huh?

212
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,841
- Take a look, Mom.
- Thi, dear.

213
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,880
I don't think so.

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
Woah!

215
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,600
How messy.

216
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,200
Oh, right.

217
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,700
Have you ever eaten fish before?

218
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,060
Eat a lot of fish so you can be smarter.

219
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,340
Thank you.

220
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,980
I think it's you that should eat a lot.

221
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,240
You mean eggs, Mom?

222
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,360
I mean fish! So you can be smarter.

223
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,900
- I'm already smart.
- Oh really?

224
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,361
- Auntie Tim.
- What?

225
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,600
Can we start eating now?

226
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,240
What are you waiting for?

227
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,600
Oh, I can just dig in? What the heck was I waiting for?

228
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,500
- Mom, would you like some fish?
- I think so, too.

229
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,100
I'm already smart.

230
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,063
- Let me get you some.
- No need.

231
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,800
Two fish will make you twice as smart.

232
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,280
Who taught you that?

233
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,920
It's too much.

234
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,880
That's what I thought.

235
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,960
Mom!

236
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,920
So she can be smarter. Even though she already is.

237
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,940
He could be twice as smart.

238
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,194
- Yummy!
- Spicy!

239
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,020
It's a chili sauce. Of course, it's spicy.

240
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,800
You're pretty useful.

241
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,320
Thi, I'm so sorry, dear.

242
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,840
You got into a lot of trouble because of me.

243
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,900
No worries, Auntie Tim.

244
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,160
I'm still okay.

245
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,840
If you can't put up with Noey anymore,

246
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,200
let me know immediately.

247
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,240
That was a long time ago, Auntie Tim.

248
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Please help me.

249
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,160
Damn it! That's annoying!

250
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,440
If it doesn't work, then just take another bike.

251
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Come on…

252
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,560
There is more than one bike here. Can't you see?

253
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,020
Thi, are you okay?

254
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm fine.

255
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,840
Let me know immediately. Okay?

256
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Yes, Ma'am.

257
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,520
Move this bike out of the way! Otherwise, how can you take it out?

258
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,060
Goodness Thiw, you're so…

259
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,580
You act like you've never ridden this bike before.

260
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,660
Goodness Noey, hurry up!

261
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,060
Thank you.

262
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,980
- Oh.
- You're such a dummy.

263
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,480
Thiw.

264
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,700
I can walk home alone.

265
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:58,420
So you can go fill up your tank and drive home.

266
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,560
Who would let you walk alone at this hour?

267
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,920
If something happens, who will help you?

268
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,280
Hey, I'll be fine.

269
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,040
I walk in this alley all the time.

270
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,220
Okay. From now on, I'll walk you home every day.

271
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,440
You okay with that?

272
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,160
No, no. Actually, it's not all the time.

273
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,240
I'll help you with the bike.

274
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
No need.

275
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm flirting with you.

276
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,900
Just let me do it.

277
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,680
So you will be impressed.

278
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,120
Damn. Is he for real?

279
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,020
This is nuts.

280
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,180
I'm serious. I'm not fooling around.

281
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,970
I know that you have had a crush on me for a while now.

282
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,600
But please, let me make a move.

283
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,640
Got it?

284
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,360
When I do it well enough,

285
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,260
you can give in to me.

286
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,100
But… for now, I just ask that...

287
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,400
that we can stay together like this.

288
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,240
Give me some time to flirt.

289
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,040
I've prepared myself for this.

290
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,600
Don't leave me just yet.

291
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,860
Thi! What're you doing here?

292
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,040
Just go! What are you lingering around for?

293
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,120
I'm going home now.

294
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,880
I'm too lazy to walk you to your dorm. I'm sleepy!

295
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Go ahead!

296
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,620
Just get going! Your friends are waiting.

297
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,740
What is it?

298
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,560
Let's go. Get in the car.

299
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,000
Hey. We are not drunk yet.

300
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,020
We didn't even drink. So don't assume that we're drunk driving.

301
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,900
We bought alcohol. We changed our minds to drink at your place instead.

302
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,103
- I'll get going then.
- Yeah. What are you waiting for?

303
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,980
Wait!

304
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,900
What is it?

305
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,960
You're such a hassle.

306
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,180
I told you to go home, but you didn't listen.

307
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,240
Watphlus never leave each other.

308
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Because you're so cute.

309
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
Huh?

310
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,740
All done.

311
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,640
It's okay. I'll pay.

312
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm touched.

313
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,340
Go ahead. Your friends have been waiting too long.

314
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,220
We're good. No rush.

315
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,360
Let's make sure that the bike is good to go.

316
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,040
Go home safely.

317
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,940
Thank you.

318
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,580
Just wait and see. He's going to complain about something.

319
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,940
Damn it!

320
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,160
It's so difficult to put on! So troublesome.

321
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,400
There you go. That's the real Noey Watphlu.

322
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,100
Just as I thought.

323
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,560
Here.

324
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,160
Even though he is a delinquent,

325
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,860
he still needs someone to take care of him.

326
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,740
He's such a pain in the ass…

327
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,560
Drive safely, Noey.

328
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,780
Hey, you! Yes, you.

329
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,000
Are you going with us?

330
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,020
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

331
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,360
Come on, you'll see each other again.

332
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,180
- Go!
- Wait a second.

333
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,880
Go!

334
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,600
Hey. Spill it.

335
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,520
Here.

336
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,400
Oh, you meant spilling the tea?

337
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,420
My bad.

338
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,040
The thing is…

339
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,800
I see. My gosh.

340
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,783
But that's it?

341
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:29,663
Nothing else?

342
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,080
What exactly do you mean?

343
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,750
Well, between you and that kid.

344
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,140
Or maybe I should pursue you?

345
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,780
Can you teach me about Thi instead?

346
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,360
You have to endure it as a wife.

347
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,000
There's nothing going on!

348
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,100
That's all.

349
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,840
So you weren't threatened or beaten up? Or…

350
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,340
No!

351
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,620
There's nothing else. I told you everything.

352
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,720
That's all. Really.

353
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,400
You guys are so nosy.

354
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,940
Cheers!

355
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,300
Let's cheers!

356
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,224
Cheers to what? Your glass is empty.

357
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,380
Okay. I'm ready.

358
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,120
Open the lid first!

359
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,320
That was a joke.

360
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,540
Hey, Thi, if there's something going on, you can tell us.

361
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,640
No, no way. You're thinking too much.

362
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,060
Everything is perfectly normal.

363
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,920
- But you're acting weird.
- Yeah.

364
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,440
I have mine.

365
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,180
- What about you?
- No, I'm good.

366
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,940
What's wrong with you?

367
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,200
Drink up.

368
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,760
Yeah, my throat is pretty dry.

369
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,040
You want more?

370
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,340
Number two: Help them with something they can't do.

371
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,920
I took him to fight with another gang.

372
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,480
Today, I made him misbehave.

373
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm sure he was impressed.

374
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,420
Oh, I forgot to ask about my score.

375
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,260
What are you smiling about?

376
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,060
Did your dad make you laugh or something?

377
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,360
Auntie Tim.

378
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,700
What?

379
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,500
Can you buy me a helmet?

380
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,380
Huh? What did you say?

381
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,000
Am I dreaming?

382
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,360
My son asked me to buy him a helmet.

383
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,400
And one more thing. Your motorbike was out of gas.

384
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,300
But it turned out to be a good thing.

385
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,240
I got to talk to him longer.

386
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,660
What's with you?

387
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,480
And did you fill up the tank?

388
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,400
- What color do you want for a helmet?
- Any color is fine!

389
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,994
- Just use your dad's old helmet then!
- Fine.

390
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:19,660
Okay! So did you fill up the tank? You still haven't answered me.

391
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,700
Mom, you woke me up!

392
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,220
- What are you two yelling about?
- Noey didn't answer me about the gas!

393
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,400
- So did you fill up the tank for Mom or not?
- It's done already.

394
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,320
- All right, Mom? I'm going back to sleep!
- That's all. Done!

395
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,940
The next move…

396
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,300
will probably have to wait until the school break.

397
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,300
May all the students of Watphlu.

398
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,180
focus and concentrate during your exams.

399
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,740
No copying and no cheating. These will become a bad habit.

400
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,840
Us teachers believe that if our students

401
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,000
are determined, everyone will do well on the exams.

402
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Good luck to everyone.

403
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,580
May all of you get A's across the board.

404
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,260
Finally, it's time for our boss to…

405
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,120
Be on school break!

406
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,800
Yeah!

407
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,480
Whatever it is. As of now,

408
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,440
Watphlu has officially finished tenth grade.

409
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,260
Way too awesome.

410
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,900
I already told you that I'm not available.

411
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,660
And I have to set up a volunteer camp.

412
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,099
What volunteer camp? Just do it after our trip.

413
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:44,161
- No can do.
- You're being so difficult.

414
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,360
- No can do.
- You're being so difficult.

415
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,140
Who's the one being difficult?

416
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,200
Hey, I asked you to go even before my final exams.

417
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,580
It's me, Thi.

418
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,500
Final exams are approaching, and I might disappear from you for a while.

419
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,020
Don't miss me too much. But if you do, just call me.

420
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,100
If you can't reach me, you can just call Nid Nhoi.

421
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,380
Oh, and…

422
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,040
after the finals, I will take you on a trip to relax.

423
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,600
after the finals, I will take you on a trip to relax.

424
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,220
Number five... oh! Never mind. It was nothing.

425
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,980
I was talking about the exam.

426
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,540
But I didn't agree to it.

427
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,960
But you didn't tell me that you weren't going either.

428
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,980
You're so sly, Noey.

429
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,260
You've fallen right into my trap, Thi.

430
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,340
Thank you.

431
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,540
I don't like him.

432
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm going to smack him the next time I see him.

433
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,700
Don't act like a delinquent here.

434
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,420
Why not? Then go on a trip with me first.

435
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,300
What does it have to do with this?

436
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,180
Anything can be related.

437
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,060
We may be related in some way in our past lives.

438
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,240
You never know.

439
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,320
So you're going. Right?

440
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
Go with me, please?

441
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,340
I put a lot of effort into studying for the finals just for you.

442
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,020
Think about that.

443
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,340
Give it to me.

444
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,600
Hold on, hold on. What's going on?

445
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,960
Nothing.

446
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,160
Noey, give it back to him.

447
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,160
Oh, this is Phayu. He's my friend. Do you remember him?

448
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,721
I invited him to the volunteer camp.

449
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:25,380
Perfect timing. Now you guys get to know each other.

450
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,860
How's it going?

451
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,100
Hi.

452
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,180
No one wants to know you.

453
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,880
Please don't mind him.

454
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,780
He's just upset about final exams.

455
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,020
Thi.

456
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,340
You're okay. Right?

457
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,020
I'm okay. I'll clear things up with him.

458
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,000
All right then. Let's go play basketball.

459
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,020
Noey, you have to calm down.

460
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,300
You can't go around picking fights whenever and wherever you go.

461
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,180
Just sometimes.

462
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,100
Okay. Whatever you say.

463
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,700
I've been busy lately.

464
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,500
I don't have the time to argue with you.

465
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,260
Then I'll help.

466
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,500
What are you going to do? A volunteer camp?

467
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,860
I'm in. I'll go.

468
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,540
I will help you.

469
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,400
We can take a rain check on our trip for now.

470
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,820
This time, I want to focus on recreational activities as well.

471
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,500
So the kids can have some fun

472
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,220
and not stress about studying during school break.

473
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,700
Regarding the equipment, we'll let

474
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,040
our new members, Phum and Ann, explain in detail.

475
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,481
Hello. I'm Phum.

476
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:59,020
I'm Ann.

477
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,980
First off, about school supplies,

478
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,540
there are pencils, notebooks, and pens.

479
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,360
We've collected enough of these items through donations.

480
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,260
You go ahead and do your work. Don't mind me.

481
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,970
I'm going to sit here quietly.

482
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,380
No need to worry about me.

483
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,640
Thanks.

484
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,800
Anything for you, always.

485
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,780
Is there anything you want to add?

486
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:56,140
Because this year's camp is very close, unlike previous years that we went out of town.

487
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,220
If you're thinking about bringing something, but not sure if it's convenient or not.

488
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,980
Don't think too much. Just bring it along.

489
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,720
Commuting there is very convenient. Don't worry.

490
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,000
If anyone needs anything, just ask me.

491
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,280
Well, it's weird but in a good way. The camp is so close.

492
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,260
- You're right. We usually go out of town.
- Yeah.

493
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,420
This is good. We can even sneak back home for a nap.

494
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,580
Hey, please don't! Sleeping together is much more fun.

495
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,300
That's right. We'd better sleep together. Break the routine.

496
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,060
Where do you want to set up?

497
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,040
I'll do it for you.

498
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,060
Set up?

499
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,820
Set up your tent, Dummy.

500
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,820
Anywhere is fine.

501
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,060
He's quite aggressive. What made him so worked up?

502
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,440
Then I'll choose the spot where I want to sleep.

503
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,040
What's with him?

504
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,340
Let's go.

505
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,120
- Go, go, go.
- Go, Thi, go.

506
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,060
This used to be an old cemetery.

507
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,540
That spot is taken.

508
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,880
If you take that spot, you're in for something good.

509
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,620
Woah! That spot is even worse.

510
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,020
Just stepping on it, you'll be haunted all the way home.

511
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,820
It's up to you.

512
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,280
Come here.

513
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,760
Help me with this.

514
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,060
Here, here. I'll do it myself.

515
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,260
We should just order food from Auntie Tim's place.

516
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,520
What do you think?

517
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,280
Let me go and help them.

518
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,380
Noey, don't!

519
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,140
- Noey!
- Step aside. If you want some good food, let me cook.

520
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,680
What's going on?

521
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,600
- Just wait. Be patient. Just eat your meatballs.
- Oh no!

522
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,820
Help me stir the pot.

523
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,060
Noey Watphlu's cooking.

524
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,180
Hey.

525
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,060
What?

526
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,900
Oh my!

527
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,980
You said you like something sweet.

528
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,100
Yeah! That is Noey's cooking!

529
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,260
It's pretty good.

530
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,700
What? What's wrong with your tongue?

531
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,060
I'm glad you like it, Thi.

532
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,220
His cooking skills never fail me.

533
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,900
Since I was born, I tried his cooking once,

534
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,220
and it's salty to this day.

535
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,900
- You think it's good?
- Yeah.

536
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,040
We should give it to him. Here you go.

537
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,300
Finish it all then.

538
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,120
- For real?
- Yeah!

539
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,960

Hello, guys.

543
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,220
We're going to divide into groups

544
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,680
to join in activities with kids in the camp.

545
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,660
What kind of activities?

546
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,780
Do you have a part in it?

547
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,180
Well, if he's in it,

548
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,080
from now on, I'll be in it too.

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
We can just skip the camp activities.

551
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,800
Tomorrow, we have to fight with the Watpae gang.

552

- Sweet dreams, Thi.
- Sweet dreams, Phayu.

553
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:56,940
Don't let me see you going anywhere with him.

554
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,660
Noey! Speak nicely to Phayu. He's still your senior.

555
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,900
I don't even consider you as my senior, Thi.

556
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,000
How old are you?

557
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,100
Hey!

558
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,660
Hey, take cover, guys! It's raining. Come in quickly, come in.

559
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,440
Not only you can't swim but getting wet from the rain also make you sick?

560
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,580
Don't complain. You didn't even take cover from the rain.

561
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,940
Go to sleep early, Thi.

562
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,220
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

563
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,700
You're going to sleep here with me?

564
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,560
We slept together before. There's nothing to be shy about.

565
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,080
Go to sleep.

566
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,540
No, no, no!

567
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,580
We can organize the space into a library first.

568
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,220
Or we could find bookshelves from other rooms and place them here.

569
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,600
After we finish setting up, we can put some books on the shelves.

570
