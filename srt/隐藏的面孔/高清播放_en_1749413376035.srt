1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,790
It's me. Sung-jin.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,110
Got you scared, didn't I?

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
I originally wanted to tell you face-to-face.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,970
But I was afraid I‘d soften up when I saw your face.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,400
I‘m on my way out now.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,230
To Berlin.

7
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,400
I don‘t understand it either.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,970
I‘m not confident about our relationship.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,240
I don‘t understand you.

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,940
So, I‘m angry.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,520
I feel doubtful and
worried about everything.

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,810
It‘s painful for me.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,160
I‘m in a lot of pain right now.

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,070
I guess I‘m not fit for marriage after all.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,730
It was the right choice.

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,280
I‘m a weirdo.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,390
It‘s not your fault.

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,370
It‘s my fault.

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,520
That‘s why I‘m choosing to leave.

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,830
Having you by my side during this time…

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,550
I was truly happy.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,010
So I hope you can be happy too.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Goodbye.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:18,300
-=Hidden Face=-

25
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,260
The first movement, second section.

26
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
Get ready.

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,160
One, two, three.

28
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Conductor.
Administrator.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,370
You look tired.

30
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,490
Do I?

31
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,010
Anyway, I have something to
discuss with you about work.

32
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,140
It‘s about the cellist.

33
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,710
We can‘t keep practicing
with an empty seat, can we?

34
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,120
It doesn‘t sound harmonious at all.

35
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,080
But everyone‘s just exchanging
glances and pretending not to notice.

36
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,860
Yes, I know we have to
wait for Su-yeon to return.

37
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,630
But there‘s been a
lot of whispering behind.

38
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,660
I thought I should at least let you know.

39
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,910
I‘ll handle it as soon as possible.

40
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,810
Understood?

41
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
This is Geisha Coffee.

42
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,230
Give it a try.

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
Okay.

44
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
It's already the twelfth day, isn't it?

45
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes, almost.

46
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,960
I‘m certain she didn‘t go to Berlin.

47
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,220
She didn‘t take her cello either.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,530
She barely took any clothes.

49
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,790
Don‘t worry.

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,440
She‘ll be back soon enough.

51
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,220
Probably rambling nonsense.

52
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Acting like a lunatic.

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,980
Does she think dating the conductor
means she can do whatever she wants?

54
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,620
I‘m sorry.

55
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,200
Why are you apologizing?

56
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,370
She‘s probably enjoying room
service at a hotel right now.

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,480
It‘s my fault for not disciplining her.

58
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,180
I‘ve spoiled her, which led to this...

59
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,000
Or maybe I did discipline her,

60
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,810
but she ended up just like me.

61
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Either way, it‘s my fault.

62
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,960
It‘s all on me.

63
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,550
By the way,

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,320
a cellist is coming for an audition today.

65
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,190
She‘s probably waiting in your office now.

66
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,530
A cellist?

67
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, at least she contacted
someone to fill in instead of

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,920
leaving the position vacant.

69
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,170
She‘s still quite responsible.

70
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,140
But shouldn‘t we wait a few more days?

71
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,350
Is it necessary?

72
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,720
If she comes back suddenly
and finds her position replaced,

73
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,300
she might feel very hurt.

74
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,950
Honey,

75
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,550
I heard you told the manager
we can‘t wait any longer.

76
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,790
That we need a substitute.

77
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,900
You said the orchestra was out of sync.

78
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,070
I think you‘re right. After
all, you‘re the conductor.

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,910
But you should have told me yourself,

80
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,750
not let me hear it from someone else.

81
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,290
Conductor.

82
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,170
- Well…
- Go to the audition.

83
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,940
Here‘s your résumé.

84
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Yes.

85
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,080
I heard you‘re Su-yeon‘s junior,

86
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,700
but you didn‘t attend the same school.

87
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,680
We had the same teacher,
Professor Park Hyun-seong.

88
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,250
And when I was preparing
for the entrance exam,

89
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,810
Su-yeon was an assistant at the school.

90
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,110
She told me there was an opening
here and suggested I apply.

91
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Did she tell you anything else?

92
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,320
I just got her call suddenly,
so I‘m a bit confused.

93
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,470
Should I not have come?

94
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,650
No.

95
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,010
Let‘s hear you play.

96
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,900
Actually, there‘s an issue
with my instrument today.

97
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,360
If possible, could you listen
to a recorded version first?

98
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,850
Okay.

99
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,510
Schubert‘s "Cradle Song."

100
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,550
Did you just randomly choose
a favorite piece to record?

101
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,100
What do you mean by that?

102
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Well.

103
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,530
How can you apply with such a simple piece?

104
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,230
I love Schubert the most.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,960
Because his music is the saddest.

106
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,300
When I listen to sorrowful music,

107
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,430
I don‘t feel as sad myself.

108
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,700
So I really like him.

109
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,810
I‘ll leave my résumé here.

110
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,250
Please throw it in the trash for me.

111
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
I‘ll leave the USB too.

112
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
You can clear its memory
or use it for something else.

113
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,930
Or just throw it away.

114
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,000
Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Conductor.

115
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,960
I love Schubert the most.

116
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,680
Because his music is the saddest.

117
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,890
Do you need something?

118
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,810
Ah,

119
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,640
I saw the introduction.

120
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,560
Isn‘t it rude to come so suddenly?

121
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
Well.

122
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,480
I was too rude earlier today.

123
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,070
I was upset about something else,

124
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,280
and I took it out on you.

125
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,870
I came to apologize.

126
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
I‘m sorry.

127
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,290
Okay.

128
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,500
I understand.

129
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,910
Your performance.

130
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,330
I really liked it too.

131
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Please join our orchestra.

132
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,550
Really?

133
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
This

134
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,760
for me,

135
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,510
is definitely a good thing.

136
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,150
It's Schubert.

137
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,570
Yes, that's right.

138
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,070
It's Schubert.

139
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,200
It's the piece for our performance.

140
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,420
Everything else is more or less ready.

141
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,910
Please practice and come over.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Ah.

143
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,550
Also, actually,

144
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,130
I like Schubert the most too.

145
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
The reason?

146
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,640
Same as Mi-joo.

147
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,700
Ah, well...

148
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,700
First of all,

149
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,280
the instruments fit so well.

150
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,830
If the sounds blend together,

151
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,330
it becomes very noticeable.

152
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,960
You know this too, conductor.

153
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,380
Although she has done
quite a bit of practice,

154
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,420
she's still very unpolished.

155
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,050
This practice really needs Su-yeon.

156
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,090
Playing

157
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,340
has to wait for Su-yeon.

158
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,310
What do you think of that person's

159
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,310
practice today?

160
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,810
This is the first group rehearsal.

161
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,980
We need to see more.

162
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,070
But at least

163
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,280
there should be some
kind of intuition, right?

164
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Or perhaps, a feeling.

165
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,700
You could say she's
someone who works very hard.

166
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,660
Given her practice time, her level
of completion exceeded my expectations.

167
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,630
Her attitude is also very good.

168
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
So, you're saying

169
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,680
there's nothing to complain
about as a conductor.

170
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,720
Exactly.

171
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,100
But as a conductor,

172
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,730
it‘s just acceptable
as a replacement, right?

173
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,420
That‘s what you mean, isn‘t it?

174
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Isn‘t it?

175
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,350
Isn‘t it?

176
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,320
He himself said he was satisfied.
Why are outsiders saying this and that?

177
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,210
Didn't he say she's hardworking
and has a good attitude?

178
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,610
Is he satisfied?

179
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,010
She doesn't even have to play anymore.

180
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,110
This crazy girl.

181
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,330
It used to happen often.

182
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,670
If I tried a few more
times, I could start it.

183
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,380
But now, it won't ignite at all.

184
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,210
Alright.

185
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,680
This is Goyang City.

186
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
What?

187
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,430
Can you come quickly?

188
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,940
What happened to the car?

189
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,560
It broke down.

190
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,690
Are you off work?

191
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,150
Yes.

192
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,840
The cello looks so small.

193
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,300
It seemed so big in the backseat of my car.

194
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,180
At least it fit.

195
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,350
It can indeed fit in the backseat.

196
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,150
When did you see it?

197
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Ah.

198
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,520
That day...

199
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,960
The day you came for the interview.

200
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,690
I happened to see it from the window.

201
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,610
Really?

202
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,950
It‘s a bit embarrassing.

203
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,030
Well.

204
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,700
Want to grab dinner?

205
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,420
Sure.

206
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,390
But I also enjoy grilling meat myself.

207
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,510
I used to avoid touching the tongs.

208
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,680
It made me feel insecure.

209
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,020
Insecure?

210
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,140
I‘m the son of a diner owner.

211
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,610
If I grill too well,

212
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,260
people will say, "No wonder
he's the son of a diner owner."

213
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,420
It's raining.

214
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh no, we don't have an umbrella.

215
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,090
But it's nice that it's raining.

216
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,690
By the way,

217
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,190
I heard from other members that
something happened between you two.

218
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Did you have a fight?

219
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,660
- They said the girl ran away from home.
- Can we not talk about this?

220
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,410
I don‘t really want to discuss it.

221
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Okay.

222
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,960
Oh, right. I have something
I‘m insecure about too.

223
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
What is it?

224
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,460
I‘m an orphan.

225
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,010
When I was in high school,

226
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,840
my parents had an accident.

227
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,800
A car accident.

228
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,930
They passed away together.

229
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,180
My mom and dad,

230
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
both of them.

231
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,900
So I have insecurities
about being an orphan.

232
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Cheers.

233
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,370
Thank you.

234
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,410
Alright, good work.

235
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,580
Alright, alright.

236
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Let‘s go.

237
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,340
Should I sit in the back?

238
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,970
I‘m smaller than you.

239
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,010
No need, I said.

240
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,350
Once the driver arrives,

241
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,810
we'll send you home first

242
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,150
and take the cello down.

243
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,730
In the end, it makes sense for
me to sit in the front, right?

244
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,490
You‘ve said that five times already.

245
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Really?

246
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,170
Because it's raining,

247
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,710
you can hear every sound so clearly.

248
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,520
Ah, I still want to drink more.

249
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,750
The stores must all be closed by now.

250
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,660
Mi-joo.

251
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,870
What?

252
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,290
Let‘s go for another drink.

253
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,710
Where to?

254
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,510
Do you want to come to my place?

255
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,320
Actually, I don‘t understand
the taste of wine at all.

256
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,240
This wine must be good, right?

257
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,050
Honestly, I don‘t understand it either.

258
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,920
You don‘t have to agree with me.

259
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,400
You clearly know a lot about it.

260
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,380
I really don‘t. I just drink it like this.

261
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
And then I...

262
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,010
When it comes to detailed
descriptions of wine and coffee,

263
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,760
I despise it.

264
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Like what?

265
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,770
Smells like the earth in August.

266
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,440
Something that‘s tasted the sun in May.

267
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,190
It‘s ridiculous.

268
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,190
Well then,

269
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,450
let‘s toast as people who
don‘t really understand.

270
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,230
This house is amazing.

271
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,580
I‘m completely drunk.

272
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,450
I always get drunk if I drink wine.

273
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,710
I feel dizzy. Even after washing
my face, it‘s still the same.

274
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,220
Drunk, rained on. It‘s such a mess.

275
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,330
Don‘t do this.

276
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,580
In this room,

277
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,450
you can‘t do this in this room.

278
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,370
Don‘t do this.

279
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,790
How will I face her after this?

280
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,350
Wait a second.

281
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,970
I did that because I like you.

282
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,060
Why did you undress me?

283
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I heard it‘s made from the poop of
civet cats after they eat coffee beans.

284
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,840
Amazing, right?

285
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,550
Yeah.

286
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,510
It‘s all about how you package it.

287
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,560
Even poop can be packaged like that.

288
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,560
It looks pretty decent, doesn‘t it?

289
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,640
The actual content doesn‘t really matter.

290
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,360
What matters is how others perceive it.

291
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,480
What you see is its essence.

292
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,070
That‘s why people need to
learn to package themselves.

293
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,660
People are also just a
product of packaging, right?

294
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,580
But...

295
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,170
Su-yeon...

296
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,500
Don‘t you think it‘s strange?

297
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,470
I thought she was acting this way
because she‘s about to get married.

298
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,390
But I feel it's strange.

299
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,930
Do you know what‘s the strangest thing?

300
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,730
She‘s not using her card.

301
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,900
Su-yeon is the kind of person

302
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,020
who would use her card even
if I died the day before.

303
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,530
But she hasn‘t been using it at all.

304
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,820
I think that‘s strange.

305
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,160
It‘s probably her way of
showing how angry she is.

306
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,830
Like she wants

307
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,290
to act as if she has
completely disappeared.

308
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,300
That‘s what it seems like, right?

309
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,460
I‘m starting to worry about her.

310
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,090
She‘s not someone with such strong resolve.

311
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,190
Yeah.

312
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,260
It rained a lot yesterday.

313
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,060
-=Cello, Kim Mi-joo I feel bad for letting you take a cab home. It rained a lot yesterday. That wasn‘t my fault. Everything else was my fault. Drinking,

330
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,390
Isn‘t it like I‘m a crazy woman?

331
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,230
I wasn‘t supposed to come here.

332
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,990
But I‘ve come here twice already.

333
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,540
You played the piano
and made me come here.

334
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,880
Twice, can you believe it?

335
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,090
And in her bedroom.

336
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,330
What‘s wrong?

337
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,080
The shower only has hot water coming out.

338
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,200
- It‘s okay.
- Water? What happened?

339
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,120
It‘s really fine.

340
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,960
- Not a drop splashed on me.
- Are you alright?

341
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,170
You should go.

342
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,370
-=Three months ago=-

343
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,870
What the heck? So annoying.

344
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,370
I was planning to hug you at the gate.

345
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,720
Is there anything more urgent than me?

346
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,370
I don‘t know.

347
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,290
Sung-jin, Mom said she couldn‘t come.

348
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,410
She just sent Uncle.

349
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,370
I‘ll ask Uncle to come here.

350
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,950
We‘ve got way too much luggage.

351
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,040
It‘s fine. No worries.

352
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,320
Sung-jin, let‘s grab a hot Americano.

353
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,840
I smelled it,
and now I want some too.

354
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,530
Do we have to?

355
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,330
Uncle, it‘s me.

356
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,120
Please come to Gate 3.

357
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,330
Okay.

358
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,990
I didn‘t expect you to come to the airport.

359
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,750
I was just bored and
came to drop off the keys.

360
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,410
Also, to welcome you.

361
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,870
Forget the welcome.

362
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,830
Didn‘t we agree to leave
the keys at the door?

363
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,830
Here you go.

364
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,620
About the renovation,

365
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,790
even though it‘s done,

366
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,870
- I‘m not sure if it suits your taste.
- Hey.

367
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,580
I kept watching the video
throughout the process.

368
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,120
I said it was fine while watching

369
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
and proceeded.

370
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,740
Of course, it‘s my style.

371
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,870
Why say unnecessary things?

372
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Right.

373
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,490
The one thing I don‘t like

374
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,950
is you showing up at the airport like this.

375
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,690
Don‘t you think it‘s inappropriate?

376
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,670
You‘re right.

377
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,740
I appreciate it,
but gratitude is just gratitude.

378
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,440
What‘s not okay remains not okay.

379
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,410
Right?

380
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,210
Got it.

381
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,710
Coffee. Thanks.

382
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,330
Let‘s go.

383
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,290
Are you satisfied?

384
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,460
It‘s really nice.

385
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,910
Back in school,

386
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,620
I‘d wonder why my teacher lived in

387
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,790
such a creepy house.

388
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,100
But as I got older,
I started thinking about this place.

389
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,040
It‘s nice, isn‘t it?
Everything‘s been redone.

390
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,370
Do you like it?

391
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,120
Of course, I like it.

392
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,210
You can listen to loud music here.

393
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,370
There‘s a beautiful garden.

394
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,370
It‘s my dream house.

395
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,770
Dream achieved without much effort.

396
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,830
What‘s wrong?
Don‘t you like it?

397
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,460
I said I like it,
but I‘m a little nervous.

398
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,780
Can I really live here?

399
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,530
You‘ll need to get used to it.

400
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,870
What?

401
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,910
You‘ll do everything.

402
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,830
Sung-jin, all the things you‘ve never done.

403
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Do you know why?

404
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,540
Sung-jin.

405
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,700
You‘re a conductor.

406
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
A conductor.

407
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,870
For a conductor,
everything is meant to be.

408
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,040
For my mom,

409
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,120
getting a house like this ready

410
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,250
for us is no big deal.

411
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
Don‘t feel burdened.

412
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,120
It‘s not a burden.

413
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,160
I‘m just not used to it.

414
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,180
Everything is natural for you, Sung-jin.

415
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,510
Now you know, my dear conductor.

416
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,000
I went to a place once.

417
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Was it nice?

418
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,330
The Han River is amazing.

419
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,040
Jungle at the back, ocean in the front.

420
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

421
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,290
Beautiful.

422
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,630
Jungle at the back, ocean in the front.

423
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,290
Sung-jin, see this.

424
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,370
Amazing.

425
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,460
Don't look at her bikini.

426
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,790
That's too...

427
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,410
- Too good, right?
- Seriously.

428
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,250
Five nights cost 30 million won.

429
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,330
It is expensive.

430
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,460
But it's worth it.

431
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,580
It's really beautiful?

432
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,260
Sis, you'll hold the ceremony
right after your performance, right?

433
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,900
Yes, but it's peak season then.

434
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,580
So the price will increase a bit more.

435
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,790
It's okay.

436
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,720
Wow, that's great.

437
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Darling.

438
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,370
I can smoke here, right?

439
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Yes, of course.

440
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,680
But why wash the dishes?

441
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,470
There aren't enough cups.

442
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,740
It really suits you.

443
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,110
By the way, did mom say
anything after meeting?

444
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,540
She was really happy.

445
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,670
She said you were very elegant.

446
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,680
She‘s glad I‘m marrying into a good family.

447
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,210
But after the meeting,

448
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,090
I got to know you again.

449
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,500
You really are a remarkable person.

450
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,990
Your willpower is truly strong.

451
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,770
You are very clear
about your own goal.

452
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,750
I felt how much effort

453
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,840
you put into your image.

454
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,620
Why suddenly…

455
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,000
I just had that thought.

456
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,500
If I say it the old way,
it's like starting from scratch.

457
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,840
I like you more now.

458
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,370
I was really worried about
the housewarming party.

459
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,550
But it ended in a fulfilling and grand way.

460
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Right?

461
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,400
How was it over there just now?

462
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,250
There?

463
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,210
The resort we saw in the pictures.

464
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,510
I really like it.

465
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,040
Didn't we agree that you'd
handle those things yourself?

466
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,300
Darling, you're not in a good mood.

467
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,380
Maybe...

468
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,900
It‘s because of what they said.
Why?

469
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,510
What did they say?

470
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,670
I said I was the one who seduced you.

471
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,330
Everyone was really surprised by that.

472
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,710
Everyone thinks

473
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,750
it was you who approached me first…

474
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,190
I didn‘t have that intention at all.

475
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
Alright.

476
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Okay.

477
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,630
Then let‘s settle it there.

478
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
That resort.

479
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,380
Five nights, 30 million won.

480
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,050
Do you think it‘s expensive?

481
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,130
Anyway, mom is paying.

482
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,950
Also, darling,

483
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,050
I really hate that atmosphere.

484
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,360
How should I put it?
It‘s the sarcastic, mocking atmosphere.

485
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,740
I like the best.

486
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,130
The most luxurious, the most cozy.
That‘s my preference.

487
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,530
That kind of criticism
and sarcastic atmosphere.

488
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,700
It‘s what I hate the most.

489
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,340
Let‘s get rid of that, okay?

490
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,810
Okay, I got it.

491
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,000
You go ahead and sleep.

492
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,180
Kiss me before you leave?

493
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,610
Well.

494
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,210
- How is it?
- What?

495
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,280
Isn't it getting better?

496
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,390
I feel like you're much
more at ease now than before.

497
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,170
Can't you just give
a straightforward compliment?

498
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,590
Let‘s skip that.

499
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Look at this.

500
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,270
-=Performance Plan=-

501
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,270
The planning department gave it to me.
We need to make a decision together.

502
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,700
They insist on opening
with "Unfinished Symphony."

503
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,800
Let‘s settle on that.

504
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,050
After that, it should be more lyrical.

505
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,230
This is the performance program
arranged by Venus this time.

506
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,830
I think it's quite good.

507
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,120
Of course, it‘s very successful.

508
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,160
- The opening must go smoothly.
- Of course.

509
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,310
By the way, what were you talking
to that violinist about earlier?

510
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
The violinist?

511
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,120
Were you talking to
Min-jeong on stage just now?

512
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,010
You two looked so happy talking.

513
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Did we?

514
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,000
The violinist reached out to you, and you
looked at her with such a kind expression.

515
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,710
Really?

516
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,030
She said her fingers were
weak and she was worried.

517
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,370
She said she often breaks things.

518
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,480
I see.

519
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,490
What's wrong?

520
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,750
What?

521
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,880
You've changed since you came to Seoul.

522
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
How have I changed?

523
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,510
Not only are you kind to the violinist,
but you're also considerate to everyone.

524
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,240
Why are you so cold to me?

525
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,680
What I do is either met
with sarcasm or indifference.

526
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,740
Why is that?

527
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,240
Well, let me say a few words too.

528
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,220
What do you want to say?

529
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,700
Why are you making me so embarrassed?

530
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,360
Who? Me?

531
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,290
Should you have a private meeting

532
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,580
in front of all the members?

533
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,590
Say something.

534
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,510
Do you really have to let everyone
know the conductor is just a puppet?

535
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,190
No, it's because

536
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,880
Mom discussed with me first
before planning to decide with you.

537
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,540
So does first discussion

538
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,550
really have to take place
when everyone is around?

539
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,010
Is it really that

540
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,280
embarrassing to you?

541
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,150
Should I be proud to
be treated like a puppet?

542
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,890
You‘re wearing a bracelet today.

543
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:32,520
I was too much at the airport last time.

544
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,880
I want to apologize to you.

545
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,480
That‘s understandable.

546
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,590
By the way, why didn‘t you
come to the housewarming party?

547
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,590
You didn‘t invite me.

548
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,230
Am I crazy?
I thought I invited you.

549
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,280
That's exactly your style.

550
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,410
You are indeed very straightforward.

551
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:05,870
That's great.

552
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,340
I‘m really going crazy because of Sung-jin.

553
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,590
He‘s good-looking,
and as a conductor, he‘s famous.

554
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,090
Although his family is not well-off,
it doesn‘t matter.

555
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,940
But one thing bothers me.

556
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:21,890
What is it?

557
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,770
He doesn‘t seem to like me.

558
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,840
How can he act like that
when he knows you like him?

559
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,930
Is he out of his mind?

560
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,190
But he can't not like me.

561
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,360
Even if I don't like him,
he still has to like me.

562
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,600
That's only natural.

563
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,770
How is that natural?

564
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,300
It is.

565
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,550
So, are you here to consult with me?

566
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,030
Mi-joo.

567
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:08,640
Do you remember the day I
kissed you for the first time?

568
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,700
When was it?

569
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:21,410
In the warehouse behind
the teacher‘s house.

570
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,320
Since that day,
I haven‘t liked anyone else but you.

571
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
You feel the same, right?

572
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:44,430
Even though I‘m betraying you now...

573
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,220
Yes, I'm betraying you.

574
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,570
But I will never betray our memories.

575
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,730
I hope you understand that.

576
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,560
I understand.

577
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,440
Okay.

578
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,820
Did you go to the warehouse
when you were fixing it?

579
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,270
Yes.

580
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,070
That means the key is with you.

581
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,810
You decorated it in this style.

582
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,590
It looks really good.

583
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,330
Well, what‘s the use
of just a pretty house?

584
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,220
The relationship matters too.

585
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,470
Come over here.

586
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,760
Did you bring the key?

587
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,590
OK.

588
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,610
Do we really have to go this far?

589
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,980
I was really angry.

590
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,770
I saved him.

591
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,860
I saved someone who had
no money and no decent job.

592
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,980
He doesn‘t even appreciate it and
dares to play hard to get with me.

593
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,750
Before marriage,
I must keep him in check.

594
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,400
I‘ll keep being nice to
him over and over again.

595
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,480
And he thinks he‘s lucky.

596
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:25,570
I hate that phrase the most.

597
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,360
What? Good intentions?

598
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,610
Anyway...

599
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,410
I want to see what his
attitude is when I‘m not around.

600
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,370
Where do we go in from?
Is it here?

601
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,110
Is it?

602
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,100
What are you doing?
Come over here.

603
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,330
Are you really going in?

604
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
Push it.

605
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Get in to check.

606
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,990
So cold.

607
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:57,320
Wow, this place hasn't changed at all.

608
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,530
It reminds you of old times
when you're in here, doesn't it?

609
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,160
It's a bit scary.

610
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,700
Fool, what are you afraid of?

611
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,470
I'm here.
What are you afraid of?

612
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,300
From now on,

613
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,050
if I signal you with my chin,

614
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,570
come in and wait for me,

615
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,170
okay?

616
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,500
Like your subordinate.

617
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,970
Subordinate,

618
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,820
and slave.

619
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,050
You like me?

620
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Yeah.

621
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,670
Then slave.

622
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,020
Understood?

623
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,750
Yes.

624
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,650
Kiss me.

625
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,820
What?

626
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,720
I thought you said you like me.

627
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,100
Okay, close your eyes.

628
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,550
Okay.

629
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,100
I closed my eyes.

630
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,720
Well.

631
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,720
I'm still not qualified.

632
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,320
Just don't do it.

633
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,620
It's not Sung-jin's fault.

634
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,320
It's mine.

635
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,720
So.

636
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,970
I'll leave.

637
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,950
I'm really happy to

638
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,420
have you in my life.

639
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:55,950
Goodbye.

640
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:05,000
Sad, huh?

641
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,070
Yeah.

642
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,920
You really

643
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,350
won't know what to do
when you watch this video.

644
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,720
It's so sad.

645
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,870
-=Sung-jin watch the video=-

646
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,020
Watch the video.
-=Sung-jin watch the video=-

647
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,930
-=Sung-jin watch the video=-

648
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,720
Is this one too over?

649
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,670
Forget it, it's cold.

650
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,450
But.

651
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,020
Is it Schubert?

652
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,450
Yeah.

653
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,100
Oh, you have no idea
how stubborn he is.

654
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,620
He says Schubert's the saddest.

655
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:41,350
He says that's his favorite.

656
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,120
Right.

657
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,450
Gotta make it messy.

658
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,020
Like I left suddenly.

659
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,650
He says he's not sad
because he's too sad.

660
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,300
Did you pack your bags?

661
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,020
Yeah.

662
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Okay.

663
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,950
So heavy.

664
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,570
Give me the key.

665
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,050
How long are you going to stay there?

666
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,870
I don't know. Three days, tops.

667
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,560
Because there's still practice,

668
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,530
and I'm losing weight in the process.

669
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,870
I'll get in.

670
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,050
Put the bookcase back.

671
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:21,350
Sis.

672
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,550
I'll head off.

673
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:25,670
Okay.

674
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,490
-=No signal=-

675
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,000
It's me, Sung-jin.

676
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,720
You must be scared.

677
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,370
I'm packing my bags

678
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,920
to leave for Berlin.

679
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,200
I don't know...

680
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,700
- About you are me.
- So sad.

681
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,050
I'm not sure.

682
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,500
I don't know you.

683
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,620
So I was really angry

684
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,120
and suspicious and
worried about everything.

685
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,950
Save me.

686
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,870
I'm sorry.

687
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,920
Let me go home, please.

688
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,350
Help.

689
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,370
So sad.

690
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,970
Let me see.

691
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,020
Sung-jin, I'm here.

692
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,920
Sung-jin, here.

693
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,320
Sung-jin.

694
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,800
I'm here! Inside!

695
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,200
I'm locked.

696
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,250
Hey!

697
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,270
Sung-jin!

698
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
I'm locked in here.

699
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,300
Sung-jin.

700
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,700
I'm locked in here.

701
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,200
Sung-jin, Sung-jin!

702
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
Sung-jin! Sung-jin!

703
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,350
Shit.

704
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,250
What took you so long?

705
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,120
I thought it was locked up.
It gave me a fright.

706
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,170
Are you there?

707
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,050
How did you get in?

708
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,370
How did you get into my house?

709
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,080
I'm drunk.

710
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,420
Sung-jin keeps making me drink.

711
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,540
I told him I can't,

712
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,000
but he just couldn't let me go.

713
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,770
I think he's trying to get laid.

714
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,770
Are you out of your mind?

715
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,600
I changed the key.

716
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,420
I'm trying to get under your skin.

717
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,740
Are you mad?

718
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,400
Scared?

719
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,450
Want me to get you out?

720
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,140
Can you forgive me if I let you out?

721
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,970
Oh you are gonna forgive me.

722
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,680
Then do something you can't forgive.

723
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,570
What?

724
01:01:58,940 --> 01:01:59,940
What?

725
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,570
What's wrong...

726
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Mi-joo.

727
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,540
I'm drunk.

728
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,600
I just can't drink wine.

729
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,250
What are you doing Mi-joo.

730
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:29,220
Stop, don't.

731
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,800
Mi-joo.

732
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,650
I'm so cold.

733
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,600
Stop!

734
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:40,970
Don't!

735
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,510
Mi-joo, don't you hate it
when people touch you?

736
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,770
Mi-joo, please don't.

737
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,880
Don't touch...

738
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,450
Stop Mi-joo!

739
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:53,450
No!

740
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,650
Good.

741
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,340
Well done.

742
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,310
It's fucking crazy.

743
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,510
Are you crazy.

744
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,050
Mi-joo.

745
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,600
No.

746
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,510
Stop!

747
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,200
Stop!

748
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,800
Stop! Don't do that!

749
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:05,020
Stop.

750
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:08,050
No, no!

751
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:42,630
-=7 months ago=-

752
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,560
-=I miss you=-

753
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,940
I thought you hated this place.

754
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,170
Why?

755
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,880
I was very strict

756
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,620
when you were training here.

757
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,220
It's thanks to you that
I'm able to live off my cello.

758
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,420
Of course I want Su-yeon
to buy this place.

759
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,050
Nothing changed here.

760
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:21,940
Yeah.

761
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,740
The bookshelves are really pretty.

762
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,680
Did you leave it in here too?

763
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:29,910
What?

764
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,280
You think I don't know?

765
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,000
You two get in there...

766
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,820
I know from beginning.

767
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:40,540
Sorry.

768
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,140
Don't be.

769
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,450
I thought it was just a kid's game,

770
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,200
but I didn't realize
you'd been dating so long

771
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,000
and were looking for a new house together.

772
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,850
What's the space in here for?

773
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,850
I was curious before.

774
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:06,050
My father did it when
he was building the house.

775
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,510
My father...

776
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:11,140
During the Japanese rule
era that bad unit, Unit 731,

777
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,800
he was the medical officer there,

778
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,340
so he did some bad things,

779
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,540
and just kept getting very upset,

780
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,710
always trying to hide.

781
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,580
After work, he would be in here

782
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,570
peeking at mom and us
sisters through the mirror

783
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:33,970
and would call in

784
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,400
to handcuff us.

785
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,250
Right.

786
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:41,570
You still have the
handcuffs in here, don't you?

787
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,480
What?

788
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,800
How's that?

789
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,400
You like it?

790
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,540
It's amazing. It's exciting.

791
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,220
I always wanna try it.

792
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,050
Give me the key.

793
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,970
Hey, what are you doing?

794
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,310
Sister, bring it here and untie it for me.

795
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,710
What if I don't?

796
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:34,050
You will.

797
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,910
I trust you.

798
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,800
Trust me?

799
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,570
Yes.

800
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,540
Only you.

801
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,400
I won't.

802
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:08,110
Yes, you will.

803
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,020
I'm yours.

804
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:19,230
-=She=-

805
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,600
Hello.

806
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,770
<i>It's me.</i>

807
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:24,800
<i>What's up?</i>

808
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:25,940
Finished.

809
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,340
I was gonna send you,
I'm recording a video.

810
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

811
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,800
<i>I have to say something.</i>

812
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,800
What's it?

813
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:42,220
<i>When I go to Seoul,
I go with someone else.</i>

814
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,220
With who?

815
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,800
<i>A man.</i>

816
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,020
<i>We're getting married.</i>

817
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,910
<i>I met him here.</i>

818
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,710
<i>We'll go back together.</i>

819
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:01,650
<i>What is the Wow?</i>

820
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,420
How about me?

821
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,200
<i>Yeah.</i>

822
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Right.

823
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,080
<i>Congratulate me.</i>

824
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,280
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

825
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,280
<i>Living with a man.</i>

826
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,800
<i>To live a real life
that others recognize.</i>

827
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,000
Real life.

828
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,510
<i>It's real life.</i>

829
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,710
<i>From now on.</i>

830
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,400
Now is the time to start living.

831
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,680
So how about me?

832
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,200
I'm your fake life?

833
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,450
<i>Can I be honest?</i>

834
01:09:56,370 --> 01:10:03,050
<i>You're a tool for me
to find out my G-spot.</i>

835
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,940
<i>I'm your tool?</i>

836
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,170
<i>We knew it, don't we?</i>

837
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,940
<i>Let's end it nicely.</i>

838
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:14,970
<b>Also.</b>

839
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:33,230
Do I look like a lunatic?

840
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:36,150
I'm coming.

841
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:39,950
It's already twice.

842
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:29,420
When you are out.

843
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,650
Are you going to hand
me over to the police?

844
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,630
No.

845
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,760
I won't.

846
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:40,420
No, it's not.
I'm the one who made the mistake.

847
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,720
There's no way you're
gonna have a problem.

848
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,310
I won't take it seriously.
Please open the door.

849
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,560
Please... Open the door.

850
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,770
Yeah, well, there's
nothing I can say about that.

851
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,860
But...

852
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:02,200
I understood what you said.

853
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,410
About real life.

854
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:09,790
The real isn't the real real,

855
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:12,540
it's what everyone thinks it is.

856
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,750
Yeah?

857
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,260
I got that.

858
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,760
Also.

859
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,600
It seems like I also need

860
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,060
that life.

861
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,520
What does that mean?

862
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,270
I'll have that man.

863
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,320
Let me have the real life.

864
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,370
What?

865
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,700
Sorry.

866
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:54,960
You are gonna stay there forever.

867
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:56,290
What are you doing?

868
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,290
Mi-joo.

869
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,460
Mi-joo, Mi-joo!

870
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,470
Mi-joo, there's no such thing.

871
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:01,840
I'm sorry.

872
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,640
I was wrong.

873
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,190
What happened?

874
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,900
Hot water's coming
out of the showerhead.

875
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Water?
It's fine.

876
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,160
What's wrong.

877
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,410
Don't worry.

878
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:27,410
I'm fine.
Take care.

879
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:28,870
Okay.
Alright.

880
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,250
You can only remove all the tiles

881
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,340
according to the water pipe,

882
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,890
otherwise you can only
seal the original water pipe

883
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,220
and connect the new one,
which is quite a big project,

884
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,470
but it's better this way!

885
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:54,980
But this house isn't a bomb shelter.

886
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:58,360
The walls are extra thick.

887
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,230
Here, here, and here.

888
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,490
There's someone here.

889
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,320
Hey.

890
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,490
Hey!

891
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,160
Seal off the original water main?

892
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:09,660
No, no.

893
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:11,700
No other way.

894
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,830
When can we start?

895
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:14,870
Today, or now.

896
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,210
No, no.

897
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,330
No!

898
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,330
No.

899
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:26,880
But can't you hear
the whimpering?

900
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,300
Whimpering.

901
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,970
No, no!

902
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,770
Oh, my God. I'm so scared.

903
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,110
Shit.

904
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,820
So creepy.

905
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,410
I'm heading off.

906
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:54,500
Sung-jin, it's me, it's me.

907
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,290
So weird.

908
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,620
There's no immigration records,

909
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,130
so she hasn't been abroad,

910
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,760
no record of her bank card,

911
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,390
her cell phone's been turned off,

912
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,220
she hasn't contacted me once.

913
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,810
I'm her mom.

914
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,350
I know Su-yeon.

915
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,350
This isn't the kind of
thing Su-yeon would do.

916
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:20,860
Something must happened.

917
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:27,400
She's not the one who
hides without warning.

918
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:30,450
Right? Darling.

919
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,660
Don't you think so?

920
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:33,530
Yeah.

921
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,500
So.

922
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,000
I called the police.

923
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,920
I should have called the police earlier.

924
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,300
Right.

925
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,220
The police will be at
your house tomorrow.

926
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,180
My place?

927
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:53,850
Don't be salty.

928
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,640
They're not doing this
because they suspect you,

929
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,730
they're just confirming it.

930
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:04,020
Anyway.

931
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,110
Are you doubting me now?

932
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:16,830
Doubt?

933
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,460
About what?

934
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,460
Oh, really.
It's so perfunctory.

935
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,130
This is a civil servant,

936
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,680
perfunctorily looking
for something,

937
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,390
is he looking for my buried body.

938
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:36,350
Well.

939
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,430
Don't take it personally.

940
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,270
We do what we're told.

941
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,690
In fact, when doing so,

942
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:45,940
watching your expression
change is our technique

943
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,190
to see what the reaction is.

944
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,610
How's my reaction?

945
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,780
Clear.

946
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:57,370
Clean.

947
01:16:58,330 --> 01:16:59,330
Pure.

948
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,380
Don't make fun of
me because it's small.

949
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,750
Is it because the place is
too small and you feel stuffy?

950
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,180
It's more comfy.

951
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,810
My place is too big.

952
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:52,270
I don't like that.

953
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,480
My place.

954
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,080
1117

955
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,130
What?

956
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,090
The password is 1117.

957
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:19,760
Why?

958
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:22,970
The password is the same
as Su-yeon's birthday.

959
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,020
Oh really?

960
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:32,060
I just continue to use the one set up
by the person who lived there before me.

961
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:34,780
What a coincidence.

962
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,990
It's her birthday?

963
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:40,410
I was never very good at these things.

964
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:53,710
Here.

965
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,170
Check this.

966
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,090
Conductor,
I've seen this a hundred times.

967
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,470
Check first.

968
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:04,560
Oh here.

969
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,890
Check the mirror behind Su-yeon.

970
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,230
There's a hand.

971
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,530
It belongs to others.

972
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,200
I didn't see it before

973
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,720
because I only noticed Su-yeon's face,

974
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:26,490
but today I suddenly felt weird,

975
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,330
so I looked and

976
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,950
found a hand.

977
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:31,210
Can you see it?

978
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:34,540
Yes.

979
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:40,340
Someone was with her when she left.

980
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,760
What's up.

981
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,100
You miss me?

982
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,940
Yeah.

983
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,690
You're so romantic.

984
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:58,530
Don't ring the doorbell.
Just enter the code.

985
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,190
1117

986
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,710
No one's been particularly mean to me.

987
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:20,460
Everyone's been very nice.

988
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:25,090
I've gotten to know the
cello group really well,

989
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:29,060
and last time I had
dinner with the principal.

990
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,850
Yeah, he's so nice.

991
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,730
That's the way to lose your temper.
That's the way to be a leader.

992
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,230
I should learn.

993
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,070
Yeah. There's someone.

994
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,280
The conductor.

995
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,740
You know her.

996
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,290
It's only the winds that are wrong,

997
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:52,290
but she's only mad at the strings,

998
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,750
and if it wasn't for her, we'd have a
really good orchestra atmosphere, right?

999
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:57,750
Yeah.

1000
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,800
Why you don't eat it?

1001
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,640
I have a question.

1002
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:15,770
What?

1003
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,600
You were with Su-yeon when
she ran away, weren't you?

1004
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,570
What are you talking about?

1005
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,650
I saw your wrist in the mirror.

1006
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:29,410
The bracelet.

1007
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,990
Bracelet with blue stones

1008
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,540
you didn't wear it.

1009
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:38,330
Blue stones?

1010
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:53,970
This one?

1011
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:06,030
Yeah.

1012
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,200
I was in her room the day she ran away.

1013
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:18,120
So you've been lying all this time?

1014
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,380
You lied about Su-yeon
contacting you the day she left,

1015
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,540
about not knowing her well,

1016
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,880
and about coming to our house

1017
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:27,130
for the first time.

1018
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:30,390
Sorry.

1019
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:35,140
But can you not say it's your house?

1020
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,390
What?

1021
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:45,730
What's the purpose?

1022
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:46,890
Why are you doing this to me?

1023
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,990
She let me do this.

1024
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,740
She asked me to help her
remodel the house, so I did.

1025
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,080
She said she wanted me to
help her run away, so I did.

1026
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:59,080
It was also because she
asked me to fill in for her.

1027
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,960
I just did what she told me to do.

1028
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,370
What are you talking about?

1029
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,000
Are you a servant who does
what she tells you to do?

1030
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,350
Are you under her command?
Are you her slave?

1031
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:11,680
Am I the slave?

1032
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,600
The only thing I've decided to do on my own

1033
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,850
seems to be sleeping with you.

1034
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,730
Where is Su-yeon?

1035
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:28,610
You must know.

1036
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,490
I really don't.

1037
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:32,280
Stop lying.

1038
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:37,700
You two like each other, don't you?

1039
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,160
Like?

1040
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:45,460
I saw the photo.

1041
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,210
You two.

1042
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:51,470
What do you mean?

1043
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:56,220
It's like a child's joke,

1044
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:58,600
akin to a friendship pledge.

1045
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,770
Stop.

1046
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:04,440
Tell me.

1047
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,320
Where is she?

1048
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,530
I don't know.

1049
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,240
Really. I don't know.

1050
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:33,720
I turned the water off.

1051
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,220
It's me.

1052
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,280
It's me.

1053
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,750
Turn on the water.

1054
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,120
Okay.

1055
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
Here.

1056
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,500
Su-yeon?

1057
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:51,710
Turn it off.

1058
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:06,440
Su-yeon, are you in this house?

1059
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,150
Are you locked up?

1060
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,820
I'm being held captive.
Get me out of here.

1061
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,780
Get me out of here, Sung-jin.

1062
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:16,900
Su-yeon.

1063
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:19,700
Are you there?

1064
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:21,530
Su-yeon...

1065
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:24,120
Sung-jin, here.

1066
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,120
Right in front of you.

1067
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,670
Just here. Hey!

1068
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:40,590
I'm here!

1069
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,800
Su-yeon.

1070
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:44,850
Are you in？

1071
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,940
Yes! I am!

1072
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,240
You are there.

1073
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:01,030
Yes.

1074
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,850
Why?

1075
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:27,390
Oh.

1076
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:29,940
Don't go.

1077
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,820
What's wrong?

1078
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:42,860
What's wrong?

1079
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,080
So you saw it all there, too.

1080
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,210
Right?

1081
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:56,090
What I did with Mi-joo.

1082
01:28:58,630 --> 01:28:59,840
You saw it all.

1083
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,140
It doesn't matter.
Just get me out of here. I don't care.

1084
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,470
I don't care anymore.
Let me out of here.

1085
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:07,850
Help me.

1086
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:14,770
Mi-joo came here because she knew about it.

1087
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:15,770
Yes?

1088
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:19,690
To show you.

1089
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:22,860
Yeah?

1090
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:26,830
She knew you were watching.

1091
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,330
I don't care.

1092
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:32,540
Really, I don't.

1093
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:34,710
- Ah, fuck!
- It really doesn't matter.

1094
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:36,380
I won't take it in mind.

1095
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,130
You...

1096
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,380
What's wrong?

1097
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,090
Please save me.

1098
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,510
Sung-jin, help me.

1099
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:44,680
Please, help me.

1100
01:29:44,930 --> 01:29:46,390
Please, please.

1101
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:50,470
Help me out.

1102
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:56,060
Please get me out.

1103
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,070
It's her fault.

1104
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:04,660
She used me and then dumped me.

1105
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:06,510
And that's why you're imprisoning her?

1106
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,450
It's not me.

1107
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:11,330
She walked in there.

1108
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:15,080
But something went wrong.

1109
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:19,090
I just didn't release her.

1110
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:22,820
That's the same.

1111
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:23,820
No.

1112
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,670
Imprison is crime.

1113
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:35,060
Get her out.

1114
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,320
Is being kind.

1115
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:41,220
I don't have kindness for her now.

1116
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,630
She's a bitch.

1117
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:51,010
Only use people,

1118
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:52,290
and dump them.

1119
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,020
So what are you going to do?

1120
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,320
Just lock her up?

1121
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,630
What if she will die of hunger?

1122
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,140
That's the point.

1123
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:03,260
There shouldn't be any food.

1124
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:07,150
Mi-joo.

1125
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:09,310
It's like murder, no.

1126
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:11,820
It is murder.

1127
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:14,130
What do you want me to do?

1128
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,590
Get her out.

1129
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:19,570
And say sorry, I'm kidding?

1130
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:22,730
She will say, it's okay,
I made mistakes.

1131
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,240
And that's it?

1132
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:25,960
But it's not right.

1133
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,440
You know her.

1134
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:29,240
Not just me.

1135
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:32,400
She's gonna make us both accomplices

1136
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:36,500
and put us in jail together.

1137
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:38,910
That's why you're on my side now, isn't it,

1138
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,900
because you're scared,

1139
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:44,300
or you'd have called the police
or a professional to save her.

1140
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:45,940
Or what do you want?

1141
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,040
You're gonna keep her
in there until she dies?

1142
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,060
I don't know.

1143
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:05,320
Now that you know about it, I feel good.

1144
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:07,820
You make the decision.

1145
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:09,410
I'll follow your decision.

1146
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:11,090
No matter what.

1147
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:33,660
You won't forgive me.

1148
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,390
It's been really hard for
me to get here, damn it.

1149
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,800
The moment you come out,
you're gonna wipe me out.

1150
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:58,690
You're gonna pulverize me.

1151
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,860
Right.

1152
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,750
I'm guilty.

1153
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:09,770
Yeah.

1154
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,060
Shit.

1155
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:19,940
But Su-yeon.

1156
01:33:20,910 --> 01:33:22,500
You lied.

1157
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:25,150
You like women.

1158
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:28,810
Don't you?

1159
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,250
Good, good.

1160
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,810
Wow, today's general
rehearsal was really great.

1161
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,320
We need more cooperation.

1162
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:25,520
Sit.

1163
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:30,860
But I think it's great.

1164
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:36,360
I thought today was the day of the show.

1165
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:39,170
But why do you have such
a dark look on your face?

1166
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,200
Me?

1167
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:47,210
Are you hiding something?

1168
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,520
No.

1169
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:58,580
Have you heard anything about Su-yeon?

1170
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:03,030
No.

1171
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:04,910
Ah.

1172
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,840
You guys are just now getting your act
together, and it's a real pain in the ass.

1173
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:12,780
Su-yeon

1174
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:16,180
left because she doesn't like you.

1175
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:18,910
But as her mom, I'm hiring you.

1176
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,260
No, give you promotion.

1177
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,230
I don't think she'll come
back if we keep this up.

1178
01:35:26,110 --> 01:35:27,160
It's a really sudden idea.

1179
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,960
If Su-yeon won't come back in this way,

1180
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:35,210
how am I going to handle
my relationship with you?

1181
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:36,620
Frustrating.

1182
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,600
Right?

1183
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,910
It was supposed to be a fun day.

1184
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:08,940
-=Su-yeon(2)=-

1185
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:14,070
-=Su-yeon ...it's me.=-

1186
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,780
-=She Are you happy without me?=-

1187
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,050
What are you going to do?

1188
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:36,310
Mi-joo, cheer up.

1189
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:39,850
If she's gone, that means she's alive.
We haven't committed a serious crime.

1190
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:42,690
That's you.

1191
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:44,620
But.

1192
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,170
I've committed a great crime.

1193
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,020
That's better than killing someone.

1194
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,340
I checked.

1195
01:36:57,620 --> 01:36:59,710
The keys are in my bag.
They're intact.

1196
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,340
I doubted you.

1197
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,440
What?

1198
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,060
Yeah.

1199
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,430
I mean.

1200
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,700
Let's just

1201
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,530
wait and see.

1202
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,380
It's not an easy place to get out.

1203
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:22,410
Calm down.

1204
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:23,410
No.

1205
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,440
Open it.

1206
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,630
Or I'll call the police.

1207
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:44,290
The conductor suddenly had an emergency

1208
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:45,970
and had to cancel the afternoon rehearsal.

1209
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:47,930
And, cellist Kim Mi-joo,

1210
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:50,450
has gone to the hospital

1211
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:53,030
because she's not feeling well.

1212
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:54,630
That's all.

1213
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:57,610
Off you go.

1214
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:02,720
So scaring.

1215
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,700
What's that?

1216
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,680
After reading the text,

1217
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,660
he'll come running to this room
if he hasn't committed a crime,

1218
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,240
or leave early if he has.

1219
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,330
Wow.

1220
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:15,840
So an agent can open the same phone number

1221
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,600
as long as they have a copy

1222
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,000
of their ID card.

1223
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:22,350
They must have never dreamed

1224
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,950
of falling into a trap.

1225
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,750
I'm... scared.

1226
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:34,060
What have they done?

1227
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,060
I'm so scared.

1228
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,350
It's the enter?

1229
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,790
Behind here is the secret room.

1230
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,860
How can you open this?

1231
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,080
Sung-jin.

1232
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:53,740
There's no way out of here.

1233
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:57,160
How do you open it?

1234
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:59,230
I told you there's no way out of here.

1235
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:00,440
Mi-joo.

1236
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,470
Su-yeon.

1237
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:33,120
Su-yeon, are you okay?

1238
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:35,960
See?

1239
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:38,990
There's no easy way out of here.

1240
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,930
What the hell was that text message about?

1241
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:51,730
Su-yeon.

1242
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:57,940
Are you alright?

1243
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:01,890
She's alive.

1244
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:06,570
Su-yeon.

1245
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:11,370
Wake up.

1246
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,880
Su-yeon.

1247
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:16,930
Su-yeon, enough.

1248
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,300
Su-yeon, enough.

1249
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:22,460
She's out of her mind.

1250
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:23,220
She's crazy.

1251
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,930
- Let go of me.
- Let's get out of here.

1252
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:25,990
- She's crazy.
- Let go of me.

1253
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:27,330
Sung-jin, let's get out of here.

1254
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:29,000
- Let go of me.
- She's out of her mind.

1255
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,050
- Let's get out of here.
- Let go of me.

1256
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,500
Let me go.

1257
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:37,770
Su-yeon.

1258
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:48,450
Get up.

1259
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:51,050
Are you okay?

1260
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:53,940
Let's go out, Sung-jin.

1261
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:55,710
I'm on my own.

1262
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:19,920
Get some rest. Eat something.

1263
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,260
I'm going to the police.

1264
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,220
No need.

1265
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,080
Don't.

1266
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:32,530
I'm hungry.

1267
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,910
Order some food.

1268
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,240
Kimchi soup.

1269
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:47,700
Okay.

1270
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:54,040
I'll take a shower first.

1271
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:57,510
I really want to take a shower.

1272
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:06,930
Help me take it off.

1273
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:38,170
Mi-joo.

1274
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:42,170
You are there.

1275
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:49,560
I'm gonna take a shower now.

1276
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:50,810
Hot shower.

1277
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:57,090
Hey.

1278
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:59,220
Try being an idiot like me.

1279
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:00,710
You know.

1280
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,270
I won't give you water.

1281
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:07,660
I'll tell you the rest

1282
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:10,370
when I've had a shower, Mi-joo.

1283
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:15,190
Hey.

1284
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:16,900
Hey!

1285
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,450
I was worried when you never contacted me.

1286
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,240
I didn't expect you to show up
and give me the rest of the money.

1287
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:34,990
That's Shin Su-yeon.

1288
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:37,290
How's Mi-joo?

1289
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,060
Teacher

1290
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,720
You know right?

1291
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:42,360
About you?

1292
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,630
I'm the teacher.

1293
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,090
I'm getting married with Sung-jin.

1294
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,310
And our relationship has gotten weird.

1295
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:51,950
But.

1296
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:54,550
I'm still not going to break it off.

1297
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,330
I can't lose her.

1298
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,740
I used to look at you and think,

1299
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:06,450
“No one can win her possessiveness."

1300
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:08,950
You got everything.

1301
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,700
My house is yours.

1302
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,430
Well, that's true.

1303
01:45:28,770 --> 01:45:29,770
But.

1304
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,740
Did you say something bad

1305
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,830
about me to Mi-joo,

1306
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:40,130
that I'm the one who
uses and then discards?

1307
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:45,470
I liked you before.

1308
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,080
Flowers are pretty.

1309
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:00,890
And teacher,

1310
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:04,000
your house is so good.

1311
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,280
So good.

1312
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,880
Really.

1313
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,650
It's a house that brings happiness.

1314
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:32,310
-=Alarm=-

1315
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:59,020
Do you go golfing?

1316
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,620
I woke you up.

1317
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:03,930
No.

1318
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:05,880
I gotta get up.

1319
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:10,290
Looks like you're totally into golf.

1320
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:12,890
It's fun.

1321
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:15,330
Mom,

1322
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,360
asks me to go next week.

1323
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I know.

1324
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:22,070
Get more sleep.

1325
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:23,390
I'll be back.

1326
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,960
Have fun.

1327
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:13,290
Locked up?

1328
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,800
Give me the key.

1329
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:09,000
You look good.

1330
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:23,810
Are you waiting for me?

1331
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:26,310
Yeah.

1332
01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:38,890
Take it off.

1333
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:17,730
