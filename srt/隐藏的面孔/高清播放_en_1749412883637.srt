1
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,790
It's me. Sung-jin.

2
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,110
Got you scared, didn't I?

3
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
I originally wanted to tell you face-to-face.

4
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,970
But I was afraid I‘d soften up when I saw your face.

5
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,400
I‘m on my way out now.

6
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,230
To Berlin.

7
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,400
I don‘t understand it either.

8
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,970
I‘m not confident about our relationship.

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,239
I don‘t understand you.

10
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,940
So, I‘m angry.

11
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,520
I feel doubtful and
worried about everything.

12
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,810
It‘s painful for me.

13
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,160
I‘m in a lot of pain right now.

14
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,070
I guess I‘m not fit for marriage after all.

15
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,730
It was the right choice.

16
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,280
I‘m a weirdo.

17
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,390
It‘s not your fault.

18
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,370
It‘s my fault.

19
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,520
That‘s why I‘m choosing to leave.

20
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,830
Having you by my side during this time…

21
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,550
I was truly happy.

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,010
So I hope you can be happy too.

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Goodbye.

24
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:58,300
-=Hidden Face=-

25
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,260
The first movement, second section.

26
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Get ready.

27
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,160
One, two, three.

28
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Conductor.
Administrator.

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,370
You look tired.

30
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,490
Do I?

31
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,010
Anyway, I have something to
discuss with you about work.

32
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,140
It‘s about the cellist.

33
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,710
We can‘t keep practicing
with an empty seat, can we?

34
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,120
It doesn‘t sound harmonious at all.

35
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,080
But everyone‘s just exchanging
glances and pretending not to notice.

36
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,859
Yes, I know we have to
wait for Su-yeon to return.

37
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,629
But there‘s been a
lot of whispering behind.

38
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,660
I thought I should at least let you know.

39
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,910
I‘ll handle it as soon as possible.

40
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,810
Understood?

41
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
This is Geisha Coffee.

42
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,230
Give it a try.

43
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Okay.

44
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,520
It's already the twelfth day, isn't it?

45
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,040
Yes, almost.

46
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,960
I‘m certain she didn‘t go to Berlin.

47
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,220
She didn‘t take her cello either.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,529
She barely took any clothes.

49
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,790
Don‘t worry.

50
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,440
She‘ll be back soon enough.

51
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,220
Probably rambling nonsense.

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Acting like a lunatic.

53
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,980
Does she think dating the conductor
means she can do whatever she wants?

54
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,620
I‘m sorry.

55
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,200
Why are you apologizing?

56
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,370
She‘s probably enjoying room
service at a hotel right now.

57
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,480
It‘s my fault for not disciplining her.

58
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,180
I‘ve spoiled her, which led to this...

59
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,000
Or maybe I did discipline her,

60
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,810
but she ended up just like me.

61
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,360
Either way, it‘s my fault.

62
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,960
It‘s all on me.

63
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
By the way,

64
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,320
a cellist is coming for an audition today.

65
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,190
She‘s probably waiting in your office now.

66
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,530
A cellist?

67
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,799
Yes, at least she contacted
someone to fill in instead of

68
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
leaving the position vacant.

69
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,170
She‘s still quite responsible.

70
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,140
But shouldn‘t we wait a few more days?

71
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,350
Is it necessary?

72
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,719
If she comes back suddenly
and finds her position replaced,

73
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,300
she might feel very hurt.

74
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,950
Honey,

75
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,550
I heard you told the manager
we can‘t wait any longer.

76
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,790
That we need a substitute.

77
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,900
You said the orchestra was out of sync.

78
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,070
I think you‘re right. After
all, you‘re the conductor.

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,910
But you should have told me yourself,

80
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,750
not let me hear it from someone else.

81
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,290
Conductor.

82
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,170
- Well…
- Go to the audition.

83
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,940
Here‘s your résumé.

84
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Yes.

85
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,079
I heard you‘re Su-yeon‘s junior,

86
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,700
but you didn‘t attend the same school.

87
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,680
We had the same teacher,
Professor Park Hyun-seong.

88
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,249
And when I was preparing
for the entrance exam,

89
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,810
Su-yeon was an assistant at the school.

90
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,110
She told me there was an opening
here and suggested I apply.

91
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,400
Did she tell you anything else?

92
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,320
I just got her call suddenly,
so I‘m a bit confused.

93
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,470
Should I not have come?

94
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,650
No.

95
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,010
Let‘s hear you play.

96
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,899
Actually, there‘s an issue
with my instrument today.

97
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,359
If possible, could you listen
to a recorded version first?

98
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,850
Okay.

99
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,510
Schubert‘s "Cradle Song."

100
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,550
Did you just randomly choose
a favorite piece to record?

101
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,099
What do you mean by that?

102
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Well.

103
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,530
How can you apply with such a simple piece?

104
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,230
I love Schubert the most.

105
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Because his music is the saddest.

106
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,300
When I listen to sorrowful music,

107
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,430
I don‘t feel as sad myself.

108
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,700
So I really like him.

109
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,809
I‘ll leave my résumé here.

110
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,250
Please throw it in the trash for me.

111
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,119
I‘ll leave the USB too.

112
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,759
You can clear its memory
or use it for something else.

113
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,930
Or just throw it away.

114
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,000
Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Conductor.

115
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,960
I love Schubert the most.

116
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,680
Because his music is the saddest.

117
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,890
Do you need something?

118
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,810
Ah,

119
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,640
I saw the introduction.

120
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,560
Isn‘t it rude to come so suddenly?

121
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
Well.

122
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,480
I was too rude earlier today.

123
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,070
I was upset about something else,

124
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,280
and I took it out on you.

125
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,870
I came to apologize.

126
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,620
I‘m sorry.

127
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,290
Okay.

128
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,500
I understand.

129
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,910
Your performance.

130
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,330
I really liked it too.

131
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
Please join our orchestra.

132
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,550
Really?

133
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
This

134
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,760
for me,

135
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,510
is definitely a good thing.

136
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,150
It's Schubert.

137
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,570
Yes, that's right.

138
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,070
It's Schubert.

139
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,200
It's the piece for our performance.

140
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,420
Everything else is more or less ready.

141
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,910
Please practice and come over.

142
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Ah.

143
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,550
Also, actually,

144
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,130
I like Schubert the most too.

145
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
The reason?

146
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,640
Same as Mi-joo.

147
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,700
Ah, well...

148
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,700
First of all,

149
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,280
the instruments fit so well.

150
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,830
If the sounds blend together,

151
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,330
it becomes very noticeable.

152
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,960
You know this too, conductor.

153
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,380
Although she has done
quite a bit of practice,

154
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,420
she's still very unpolished.

155
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,050
This practice really needs Su-yeon.

156
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,090
Playing

157
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,340
has to wait for Su-yeon.

158
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,309
What do you think of that person's

159
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,310
practice today?

160
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,810
This is the first group rehearsal.

161
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,980
We need to see more.

162
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,070
But at least

163
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,280
there should be some
kind of intuition, right?

164
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Or perhaps, a feeling.

165
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,700
You could say she's
someone who works very hard.

166
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,660
Given her practice time, her level
of completion exceeded my expectations.

167
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,630
Her attitude is also very good.

168
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
So, you're saying

169
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,680
there's nothing to complain
about as a conductor.

170
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,720
Exactly.

171
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,100
But as a conductor,

172
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,730
it‘s just acceptable
as a replacement, right?

173
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,416
That‘s what you mean, isn‘t it?

174
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Isn‘t it?

175
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,350
Isn‘t it?

176
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,320
He himself said he was satisfied.
Why are outsiders saying this and that?

177
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,206
Didn't he say she's hardworking
and has a good attitude?

178
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,610
Is he satisfied?

179
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,010
She doesn't even have to play anymore.

180
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,110
This crazy girl.

181
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,330
It used to happen often.

182
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,669
If I tried a few more
times, I could start it.

183
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,380
But now, it won't ignite at all.

184
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,210
Alright.

185
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,680
This is Goyang City.

186
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
What?

187
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,430
Can you come quickly?

188
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,940
What happened to the car?

189
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,560
It broke down.

190
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,690
Are you off work?

191
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,150
Yes.

192
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,840
The cello looks so small.

193
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,300
It seemed so big in the backseat of my car.

194
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,180
At least it fit.

195
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,350
It can indeed fit in the backseat.

196
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,150
When did you see it?

197
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Ah.

198
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,520
That day...

199
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,956
The day you came for the interview.

200
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,690
I happened to see it from the window.

201
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,610
Really?

202
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,950
It‘s a bit embarrassing.

203
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,030
Well.

204
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,700
Want to grab dinner?

205
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,420
Sure.

206
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,390
But I also enjoy grilling meat myself.

207
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,510
I used to avoid touching the tongs.

208
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,680
It made me feel insecure.

209
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,020
Insecure?

210
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,140
I‘m the son of a diner owner.

211
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,610
If I grill too well,

212
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,260
people will say, "No wonder
he's the son of a diner owner."

213
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,420
It's raining.

214
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh no, we don't have an umbrella.

215
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,090
But it's nice that it's raining.

216
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,690
By the way,

217
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,190
I heard from other members that
something happened between you two.

218
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Did you have a fight?

219
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,661
- They said the girl ran away from home.
- Can we not talk about this?

220
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,410
I don‘t really want to discuss it.

221
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Okay.

222
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,960
Oh, right. I have something
I‘m insecure about too.

223
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
What is it?

224
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,460
I‘m an orphan.

225
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,010
When I was in high school,

226
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,840
my parents had an accident.

227
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,800
A car accident.

228
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,930
They passed away together.

229
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,180
My mom and dad,

230
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
both of them.

231
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
So I have insecurities
about being an orphan.

232
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,060
Cheers.

233
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,370
Thank you.

234
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,410
Alright, good work.

235
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,580
Alright, alright.

236
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Let‘s go.

237
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,340
Should I sit in the back?

238
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,970
I‘m smaller than you.

239
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,010
No need, I said.

240
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,350
Once the driver arrives,

241
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,810
we'll send you home first

242
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,150
and take the cello down.

243
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,730
In the end, it makes sense for
me to sit in the front, right?

244
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,490
You‘ve said that five times already.

245
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
Really?

246
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,170
Because it's raining,

247
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,710
you can hear every sound so clearly.

248
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,520
Ah, I still want to drink more.

249
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,750
The stores must all be closed by now.

250
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,660
Mi-joo.

251
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,870
What?

252
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,290
Let‘s go for another drink.

253
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,710
Where to?

254
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,510
Do you want to come to my place?

255
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,320
Actually, I don‘t understand
the taste of wine at all.

256
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,240
This wine must be good, right?

257
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,050
Honestly, I don‘t understand it either.

258
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,920
You don‘t have to agree with me.

259
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,400
You clearly know a lot about it.

260
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,380
I really don‘t. I just drink it like this.

261
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
And then I...

262
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,010
When it comes to detailed
descriptions of wine and coffee,

263
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,760
I despise it.

264
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Like what?

265
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,770
Smells like the earth in August.

266
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,440
Something that‘s tasted the sun in May.

267
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,190
It‘s ridiculous.

268
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,190
Well then,

269
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,450
let‘s toast as people who
don‘t really understand.

270
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,230
This house is amazing.

271
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,580
I‘m completely drunk.

272
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,450
I always get drunk if I drink wine.

273
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,710
I feel dizzy. Even after washing
my face, it‘s still the same.

274
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,220
Drunk, rained on. It‘s such a mess.

275
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,330
Don‘t do this.

276
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,580
In this room,

277
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,450
you can‘t do this in this room.

278
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,370
Don‘t do this.

279
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,790
How will I face her after this?

280
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,350
Wait a second.

281
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,970
I did that because I like you.

282
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,060
Why did you undress me?

283
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,880
I heard it‘s made from the poop of
civet cats after they eat coffee beans.

284
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,840
Amazing, right?

285
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,550
Yeah.

286
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,509
It‘s all about how you package it.

287
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,560
Even poop can be packaged like that.

288
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,559
It looks pretty decent, doesn‘t it?

289
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,640
The actual content doesn‘t really matter.

290
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,360
What matters is how others perceive it.

291
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,480
What you see is its essence.

292
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,070
That‘s why people need to
learn to package themselves.

293
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,660
People are also just a
product of packaging, right?

294
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,580
But...

295
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,170
Su-yeon...

296
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,500
Don‘t you think it‘s strange?

297
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,470
I thought she was acting this way
because she‘s about to get married.

298
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,390
But I feel it's strange.

299
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,930
Do you know what‘s the strangest thing?

300
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,730
She‘s not using her card.

301
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,899
Su-yeon is the kind of person

302
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,020
who would use her card even
if I died the day before.

303
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,530
But she hasn‘t been using it at all.

304
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,820
I think that‘s strange.

305
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:48,160
It‘s probably her way of
showing how angry she is.

306
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,830
Like she wants

307
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,290
to act as if she has
completely disappeared.

308
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,300
That‘s what it seems like, right?

309
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,460
I‘m starting to worry about her.

310
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,090
She‘s not someone with such strong resolve.

311
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,190
Yeah.

312
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,060
It rained a lot yesterday.

313
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,770
-=Cello, Kim Mi-joo I feel bad for letting you take a cab home. It rained a lot yesterday. That wasn‘t my fault. Everything else was my fault. Drinking,
going to your place, especially going into the bedroom. To avoid making any more mistakes, I won‘t reply to your messages anymore. I hope you understand me.=-

314
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,520
That wasn‘t my fault.

315
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,810
Everything else was my fault.

316
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,109
Drinking,

317
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,400
going to your place,

318
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,700
especially going into the bedroom.

319
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,410

<i>Hello?</i>

327
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,390
Isn‘t it like I‘m a crazy woman?

328
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,230
I wasn‘t supposed to come here.

329
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,990
But I‘ve come here twice already.

330
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,540
You played the piano
and made me come here.

331
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,880
Twice, can you believe it?

332
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,090
And in her bedroom.

333
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,330
What‘s wrong?

334
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,079
The shower only has hot water coming out.

335
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,199
- It‘s okay.
- Water? What happened?

336
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,120
It‘s really fine.

337
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,961
- Not a drop splashed on me.
- Are you alright?

338
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,170
You should go.

339
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,370
-=Three months ago=-

340
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,870
What the heck? So annoying.

341
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,370
I was planning to hug you at the gate.

342
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,720
Is there anything more urgent than me?

343
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,370
I don‘t know.

344
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,289
Sung-jin, Mom said she couldn‘t come.

345
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,410
She just sent Uncle.

346
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,369
I‘ll ask Uncle to come here.

347
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,949
We‘ve got way too much luggage.

348
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,040
It‘s fine. No worries.

349
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,319
Sung-jin, let‘s grab a hot Americano.

350
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,840
I smelled it,
and now I want some too.

351
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,530
Do we have to?

352
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,330
Uncle, it‘s me.

353
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,120
Please come to Gate 3.

354
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,330
Okay.

355
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,990
I didn‘t expect you to come to the airport.

356
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,750
I was just bored and
came to drop off the keys.

357
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,410
Also, to welcome you.

358
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,870
Forget the welcome.

359
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,830
Didn‘t we agree to leave
the keys at the door?

360
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,830
Here you go.

361
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,620
About the renovation,

362
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,790
even though it‘s done,

363
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,870
- I‘m not sure if it suits your taste.
- Hey.

364
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,580
I kept watching the video
throughout the process.

365
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,119
I said it was fine while watching

366
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
and proceeded.

367
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,740
Of course, it‘s my style.

368
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,870
Why say unnecessary things?

369
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Right.

370
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,490
The one thing I don‘t like

371
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,950
is you showing up at the airport like this.

372
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,690
Don‘t you think it‘s inappropriate?

373
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,670
You‘re right.

374
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,740
I appreciate it,
but gratitude is just gratitude.

375
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,440
What‘s not okay remains not okay.

376
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,410
Right?

377
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,210
Got it.

378
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,710
Coffee. Thanks.

379
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,330
Let‘s go.

380
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,290
Are you satisfied?

381
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,460
It‘s really nice.

382
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,910
Back in school,

383
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,619
I‘d wonder why my teacher lived in

384
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,790
such a creepy house.

385
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,096
But as I got older,
I started thinking about this place.

386
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,040
It‘s nice, isn‘t it?
Everything‘s been redone.

387
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,370
Do you like it?

388
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,120
Of course, I like it.

389
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,210
You can listen to loud music here.

390
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,370
There‘s a beautiful garden.

391
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,370
It‘s my dream house.

392
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,770
Dream achieved without much effort.

393
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,830
What‘s wrong?
Don‘t you like it?

394
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,460
I said I like it,
but I‘m a little nervous.

395
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,780
Can I really live here?

396
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,530
You‘ll need to get used to it.

397
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,870
What?

398
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,910
You‘ll do everything.

399
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,830
Sung-jin, all the things you‘ve never done.

400
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Do you know why?

401
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,540
Sung-jin.

402
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,700
You‘re a conductor.

403
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
A conductor.

404
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,870
For a conductor,
everything is meant to be.

405
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,040
For my mom,

406
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,119
getting a house like this ready

407
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,250
for us is no big deal.

408
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Don‘t feel burdened.

409
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,120
It‘s not a burden.

410
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,160
I‘m just not used to it.

411
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,180
Everything is natural for you, Sung-jin.

412
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,510
Now you know, my dear conductor.

413
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,999
I went to a place once.

414
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Was it nice?

415
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,330
The Han River is amazing.

416
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:04,039
Jungle at the back, ocean in the front.

417
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

418
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,290
Beautiful.

419
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,630
Jungle at the back, ocean in the front.

420
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,290
Sung-jin, see this.

421
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,369
Amazing.

422
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,460
Don't look at her bikini.

423
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,790
That's too...

424
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,410
- Too good, right?
- Seriously.

425
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,249
Five nights cost 30 million won.

426
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,329
It is expensive.

427
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,460
But it's worth it.

428
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,580
It's really beautiful?

429
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,260
Sis, you'll hold the ceremony
right after your performance, right?

430
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,900
Yes, but it's peak season then.

431
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,580
So the price will increase a bit more.

432
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,790
It's okay.

433
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,720
Wow, that's great.

434
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Darling.

435
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,370
I can smoke here, right?

436
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
Yes, of course.

437
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,680
But why wash the dishes?

438
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,470
There aren't enough cups.

439
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
It really suits you.

440
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,110
By the way, did mom say
anything after meeting?

441
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,540
She was really happy.

442
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,670
She said you were very elegant.

443
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,680
She‘s glad I‘m marrying into a good family.

444
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,210
But after the meeting,

445
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,090
I got to know you again.

446
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,500
You really are a remarkable person.

447
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,990
Your willpower is truly strong.

448
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,770
You are very clear
about your own goal.

449
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,749
I felt how much effort

450
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,840
you put into your image.

451
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,620
Why suddenly…

452
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,000
I just had that thought.

453
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,500
If I say it the old way,
it's like starting from scratch.

454
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,840
I like you more now.

455
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,370
I was really worried about
the housewarming party.

456
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,550
But it ended in a fulfilling and grand way.

457
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Right?

458
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,400
How was it over there just now?

459
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,250
There?

460
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,210
The resort we saw in the pictures.

461
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,510
I really like it.

462
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,040
Didn't we agree that you'd
handle those things yourself?

463
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,300
Darling, you're not in a good mood.

464
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,380
Maybe...

465
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,900
It‘s because of what they said.
Why?

466
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,510
What did they say?

467
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:39,669
I said I was the one who seduced you.

468
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,330
Everyone was really surprised by that.

469
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,709
Everyone thinks

470
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,749
it was you who approached me first…

471
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,190
I didn‘t have that intention at all.

472
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Alright.

473
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Okay.

474
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,630
Then let‘s settle it there.

475
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
That resort.

476
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,380
Five nights, 30 million won.

477
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,050
Do you think it‘s expensive?

478
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,130
Anyway, mom is paying.

479
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,950
Also, darling,

480
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,050
I really hate that atmosphere.

481
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,360
How should I put it?
It‘s the sarcastic, mocking atmosphere.

482
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,740
I like the best.

483
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,130
The most luxurious, the most cozy.
That‘s my preference.

484
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,530
That kind of criticism
and sarcastic atmosphere.

485
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,700
It‘s what I hate the most.

486
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,340
Let‘s get rid of that, okay?

487
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,810
Okay, I got it.

488
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,000
You go ahead and sleep.

489
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,180
Kiss me before you leave?

490
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,610
Well.

491
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,210
- How is it?
- What?

492
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,280
Isn't it getting better?

493
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,390
I feel like you're much
more at ease now than before.

494
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:50,170
Can't you just give
a straightforward compliment?

495
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,590
Let‘s skip that.

496
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Look at this.

497
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,270
-=Performance Plan=-

498
00:41:55,271 --> 00:41:58,271
The planning department gave it to me.
We need to make a decision together.

499
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,700
They insist on opening
with "Unfinished Symphony."

500
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,800
Let‘s settle on that.

501
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,050
After that, it should be more lyrical.

502
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,230
This is the performance program
arranged by Venus this time.

503
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,830
I think it's quite good.

504
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,120
Of course, it‘s very successful.

505
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:17,160
- The opening must go smoothly.
- Of course.

506
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,310
By the way, what were you talking
to that violinist about earlier?

507
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
The violinist?

508
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,120
Were you talking to
Min-jeong on stage just now?

509
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,010
You two looked so happy talking.

510
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Did we?

511
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,000
The violinist reached out to you, and you
looked at her with such a kind expression.

512
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,710
Really?

513
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,026
She said her fingers were
weak and she was worried.

514
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,370
She said she often breaks things.

515
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,480
I see.

516
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,490
What's wrong?

517
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:10,750
What?

518
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,880
You've changed since you came to Seoul.

519
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
How have I changed?

520
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,510
Not only are you kind to the violinist,
but you're also considerate to everyone.

521
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,240
Why are you so cold to me?

522
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,680
What I do is either met
with sarcasm or indifference.

523
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,740
Why is that?

524
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,240
Well, let me say a few words too.

525
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
What do you want to say?

526
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,700
Why are you making me so embarrassed?

527
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,360
Who? Me?

528
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,290
Should you have a private meeting

529
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,580
in front of all the members?

530
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,590
Say something.

531
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,510
Do you really have to let everyone
know the conductor is just a puppet?

532
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,190
No, it's because

533
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,880
Mom discussed with me first
before planning to decide with you.

534
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,540
So does first discussion

535
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,550
really have to take place
when everyone is around?

536
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,010
Is it really that

537
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,280
embarrassing to you?

538
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,150
Should I be proud to
be treated like a puppet?

539
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,890
You‘re wearing a bracelet today.

540
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:12,520
I was too much at the airport last time.

541
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,880
I want to apologize to you.

542
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,480
That‘s understandable.

543
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,590
By the way, why didn‘t you
come to the housewarming party?

544
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,590
You didn‘t invite me.

545
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,230
Am I crazy?
I thought I invited you.

546
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,280
That's exactly your style.

547
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,410
You are indeed very straightforward.

548
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,870
That's great.

549
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,340
I‘m really going crazy because of Sung-jin.

550
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,590
He‘s good-looking,
and as a conductor, he‘s famous.

551
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,090
Although his family is not well-off,
it doesn‘t matter.

552
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:59,940
But one thing bothers me.

553
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,890
What is it?

554
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,770
He doesn‘t seem to like me.

555
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,840
How can he act like that
when he knows you like him?

556
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,930
Is he out of his mind?

557
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,190
But he can't not like me.

558
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,360
Even if I don't like him,
he still has to like me.

559
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,600
That's only natural.

560
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,770
How is that natural?

561
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,300
It is.

562
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,550
So, are you here to consult with me?

563
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,030
Mi-joo.

564
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:48,640
Do you remember the day I
kissed you for the first time?

565
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,700
When was it?

566
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,410
In the warehouse behind
the teacher‘s house.

567
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,320
Since that day,
I haven‘t liked anyone else but you.

568
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
You feel the same, right?

569
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,430
Even though I‘m betraying you now...

570
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,220
Yes, I'm betraying you.

571
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,570
But I will never betray our memories.

572
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,730
I hope you understand that.

573
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,560
I understand.

574
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,440
Okay.

575
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,820
Did you go to the warehouse
when you were fixing it?

576
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,270
Yes.

577
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,070
That means the key is with you.

578
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,810
You decorated it in this style.

579
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,590
It looks really good.

580
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,330
Well, what‘s the use
of just a pretty house?

581
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,220
The relationship matters too.

582
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,470
Come over here.

583
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,760
Did you bring the key?

584
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,590
OK.

585
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,610
Do we really have to go this far?

586
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,980
I was really angry.

587
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,770
I saved him.

588
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,860
I saved someone who had
no money and no decent job.

589
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,980
He doesn‘t even appreciate it and
dares to play hard to get with me.

590
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,750
Before marriage,
I must keep him in check.

591
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,400
I‘ll keep being nice to
him over and over again.

592
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,480
And he thinks he‘s lucky.

593
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,570
I hate that phrase the most.

594
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,360
What? Good intentions?

595
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,610
Anyway...

596
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,410
I want to see what his
attitude is when I‘m not around.

597
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,366
Where do we go in from?
Is it here?

598
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,110
Is it?

599
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,100
What are you doing?
Come over here.

600
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,330
Are you really going in?

601
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,360
Push it.

602
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
Get in to check.

603
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,990
So cold.

604
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,320
Wow, this place hasn't changed at all.

605
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,530
It reminds you of old times
when you're in here, doesn't it?

606
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,160
It's a bit scary.

607
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,700
Fool, what are you afraid of?

608
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,470
I'm here.
What are you afraid of?

609
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,300
From now on,

610
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,050
if I signal you with my chin,

611
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,570
come in and wait for me,

612
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,170
okay?

613
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,500
Like your subordinate.

614
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,970
Subordinate,

615
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,820
and slave.

616
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,050
You like me?

617
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Yeah.

618
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,670
Then slave.

619
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,020
Understood?

620
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,750
Yes.

621
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,650
Kiss me.

622
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,820
What?

623
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,720
I thought you said you like me.

624
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,100
Okay, close your eyes.

625
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,550
Okay.

626
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,100
I closed my eyes.

627
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,720
Well.

628
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,720
I'm still not qualified.

629
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,320
Just don't do it.

630
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,620
It's not Sung-jin's fault.

631
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,320
It's mine.

632
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:23,720
So.

633
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,970
I'll leave.

634
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,950
I'm really happy to

635
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,420
have you in my life.

636
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:35,950
Goodbye.

637
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,000
Sad, huh?

638
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,070
Yeah.

639
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
You really

640
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,345
won't know what to do
when you watch this video.

641
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,720
It's so sad.

642
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,930
-=Sung-jin watch the video=-

643
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,020
Watch the video.

644
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,720
Is this one too over?

645
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,670
Forget it, it's cold.

646
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,450
But.

647
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,020
Is it Schubert?

648
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,450
Yeah.

649
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:17,100
Oh, you have no idea
how stubborn he is.

650
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,620
He says Schubert's the saddest.

651
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,350
He says that's his favorite.

652
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,120
Right.

653
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,449
Gotta make it messy.

654
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,020
Like I left suddenly.

655
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,650
He says he's not sad
because he's too sad.

656
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,300
Did you pack your bags?

657
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
Yeah.

658
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Okay.

659
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,950
So heavy.

660
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,570
Give me the key.

661
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,050
How long are you going to stay there?

662
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,870
I don't know. Three days, tops.

663
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,560
Because there's still practice,

664
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,530
and I'm losing weight in the process.

665
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,870
I'll get in.

666
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,050
Put the bookcase back.

667
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,350
Sis.

668
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,550
I'll head off.

669
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,670
Okay.

670
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,490
-=No signal=-

671
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:54,000
It's me, Sung-jin.

672
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,720
You must be scared.

673
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,370
I'm packing my bags

674
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,920
to leave for Berlin.

675
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,200
I don't know...

676
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,700
- About you are me.
- So sad.

677
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,050
I'm not sure.

678
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,500
I don't know you.

679
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,620
So I was really angry

680
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,120
and suspicious and
worried about everything.

681
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:17,950
Save me.

682
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,870
I'm sorry.

683
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,920
Let me go home, please.

684
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,350
Help.

685
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,370
So sad.

686
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,970
Let me see.

687
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,020
Sung-jin, I'm here.

688
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,920
Sung-jin, here.

689
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:11,320
Sung-jin.

690
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,800
I'm here! Inside!

691
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,200
I'm locked.

692
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,250
Hey!

693
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,270
Sung-jin!

694
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
I'm locked in here.

695
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,300
Sung-jin.

696
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,700
I'm locked in here.

697
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,200
Sung-jin, Sung-jin!

698
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,200
Sung-jin! Sung-jin!

699
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,350
Shit.

700
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,250
What took you so long?

701
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,120
I thought it was locked up.
It gave me a fright.

702
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,170
Are you there?

703
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,050
How did you get in?

704
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:18,370
How did you get into my house?

705
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,080
I'm drunk.

706
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,420
Sung-jin keeps making me drink.

707
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,539
I told him I can't,

708
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,000
but he just couldn't let me go.

709
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,770
I think he's trying to get laid.

710
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:34,770
Are you out of your mind?

711
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,600
I changed the key.

712
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:42,420
I'm trying to get under your skin.

713
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,740
Are you mad?

714
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,400
Scared?

715
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,450
Want me to get you out?

716
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:12,140
Can you forgive me if I let you out?

717
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,970
Oh you are gonna forgive me.

718
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,680
Then do something you can't forgive.

719
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:36,570
What?

720
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:39,940
What?

721
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:44,570
What's wrong...

722
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,400
Mi-joo.

723
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,540
I'm drunk.

724
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,600
I just can't drink wine.

725
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,250
What are you doing Mi-joo.

726
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:09,220
Stop, don't.

727
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Mi-joo.

728
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,650
I'm so cold.

729
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,600
Stop!

730
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:20,970
Don't!

731
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:24,510
Mi-joo, don't you hate it
when people touch you?

732
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,770
Mi-joo, please don't.

733
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,880
Don't touch...

734
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,450
Stop Mi-joo!

735
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:33,450
No!

736
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,650
Good.

737
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,340
Well done.

738
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,310
It's fucking crazy.

739
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:53,510
Are you crazy.

740
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,050
Mi-joo.

741
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,600
No.

742
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,510
Stop!

743
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,200
Stop!

744
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,800
Stop! Don't do that!

745
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,020
Stop.

746
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,050
No, no!

747
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:22,630
-=7 months ago=-

748
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,560
-=I miss you=-

749
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,940
I thought you hated this place.

750
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,170
Why?

751
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,880
I was very strict

752
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:46,620
when you were training here.

753
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:51,220
It's thanks to you that
I'm able to live off my cello.

754
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,420
Of course I want Su-yeon
to buy this place.

755
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,050
Nothing changed here.

756
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:01,940
Yeah.

757
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,740
The bookshelves are really pretty.

758
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:07,680
Did you leave it in here too?

759
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:09,910
What?

760
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,280
You think I don't know?

761
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,999
You two get in there...

762
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,820
I know from beginning.

763
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,540
Sorry.

764
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,140
Don't be.

765
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,450
I thought it was just a kid's game,

766
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,200
but I didn't realize
you'd been dating so long

767
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:33,000
and were looking for a new house together.

768
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,850
What's the space in here for?

769
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,850
I was curious before.

770
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:46,050
My father did it when
he was building the house.

771
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,510
My father...

772
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,140
During the Japanese rule
era that bad unit, Unit 731,

773
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,800
he was the medical officer there,

774
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,340
so he did some bad things,

775
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,539
and just kept getting very upset,

776
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,710
always trying to hide.

777
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,580
After work, he would be in here

778
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,570
peeking at mom and us
sisters through the mirror

779
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,970
and would call in

780
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,400
to handcuff us.

781
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,250
Right.

782
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,570
You still have the
handcuffs in here, don't you?

783
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,480
What?

784
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,800
How's that?

785
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,400
You like it?

786
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,540
It's amazing. It's exciting.

787
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:45,220
I always wanna try it.

788
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,050
Give me the key.

789
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,970
Hey, what are you doing?

790
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:05,310
Sister, bring it here and untie it for me.

791
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,710
What if I don't?

792
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:14,050
You will.

793
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,910
I trust you.

794
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,800
Trust me?

795
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,570
Yes.

796
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,540
Only you.

797
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:42,400
I won't.

798
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:48,110
Yes, you will.

799
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,019
I'm yours.

800
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:59,229
-=She=-

801
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,599
Hello.

802
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:03,769
<i>It's me.</i>

803
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,795
<i>What's up?</i>

804
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,939
Finished.

805
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,340
I was gonna send you,
I'm recording a video.

806
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

807
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,800
<i>I have to say something.</i>

808
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
What's it?

809
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,220
<i>When I go to Seoul,
I go with someone else.</i>

810
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,219
With who?

811
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:25,800
<i>A man.</i>

812
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,019
<i>We're getting married.</i>

813
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,910
<i>I met him here.</i>

814
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,710
<i>We'll go back together.</i>

815
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:41,650
<i>What is the Wow?</i>

816
01:09:53,139 --> 01:09:54,420
How about me?

817
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,200
<i>Yeah.</i>

818
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
Right.

819
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,080
<i>Congratulate me.</i>

820
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,280
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

821
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,280
<i>Living with a man.</i>

822
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,800
<i>To live a real life
that others recognize.</i>

823
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,000
Real life.

824
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,510
<i>It's real life.</i>

825
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,710
<i>From now on.</i>

826
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,400
Now is the time to start living.

827
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,680
So how about me?

828
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,200
I'm your fake life?

829
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,450
<i>Can I be honest?</i>

830
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:43,050
<i>You're a tool for me
to find out my G-spot.</i>

831
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:44,940
<i>I'm your tool?</i>

832
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,170
<i>We knew it, don't we?</i>

833
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,940
<i>Let's end it nicely.</i>

834
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:54,970
<b>Also.</b>

835
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,230
Do I look like a lunatic?

836
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,150
I'm coming.

837
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,950
It's already twice.

838
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,416
When you are out.

839
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:13,647
Are you going to hand
me over to the police?

840
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,626
No.

841
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
I won't.

842
01:12:17,785 --> 01:12:20,415
No, it's not.
I'm the one who made the mistake.

843
01:12:20,772 --> 01:12:22,719
There's no way you're
gonna have a problem.

844
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,309
I won't take it seriously.
Please open the door.

845
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,560
Please... Open the door.

846
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,770
Yeah, well, there's
nothing I can say about that.

847
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:35,860
But...

848
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:42,200
I understood what you said.

849
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,410
About real life.

850
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,789
The real isn't the real real,

851
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:52,540
it's what everyone thinks it is.

852
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,750
Yeah?

853
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,260
I got that.

854
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,760
Also.

855
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,600
It seems like I also need

856
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,060
that life.

857
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,520
What does that mean?

858
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:16,270
I'll have that man.

859
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:21,320
Let me have the real life.

860
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:25,370
What?

861
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,700
Sorry.

862
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,960
You are gonna stay there forever.

863
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:36,289
What are you doing?

864
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,290
Mi-joo.

865
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,460
Mi-joo, Mi-joo!

866
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:40,469
Mi-joo, there's no such thing.

867
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,839
I'm sorry.

868
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,640
I was wrong.

869
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:59,190
What happened?

870
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,900
Hot water's coming
out of the showerhead.

871
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,200
Water?
It's fine.

872
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:05,160
What's wrong.

873
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:06,409
Don't worry.

874
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:07,410
I'm fine.
Take care.

875
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:08,870
Okay.
Alright.

876
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,250
You can only remove all the tiles

877
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,340
according to the water pipe,

878
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,890
otherwise you can only
seal the original water pipe

879
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:28,219
and connect the new one,
which is quite a big project,

880
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,470
but it's better this way!

881
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:34,980
But this house isn't a bomb shelter.

882
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,359
The walls are extra thick.

883
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,229
Here, here, and here.

884
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,489
There's someone here.

885
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:43,320
Hey.

886
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:44,490
Hey!

887
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:47,160
Seal off the original water main?

888
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,660
No, no.

889
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,699
No other way.

890
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,829
When can we start?

891
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,870
Today, or now.

892
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,209
No, no.

893
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,329
No!

894
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,330
No.

895
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:06,880
But can't you hear
the whimpering?

896
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,299
Whimpering.

897
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,970
No, no!

898
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,770
Oh, my God. I'm so scared.

899
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,110
Shit.

900
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,820
So creepy.

901
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:30,410
I'm heading off.

902
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:34,500
Sung-jin, it's me, it's me.

903
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,290
So weird.

904
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,620
There's no immigration records,

905
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,130
so she hasn't been abroad,

906
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:48,759
no record of her bank card,

907
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,389
her cell phone's been turned off,

908
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,220
she hasn't contacted me once.

909
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,810
I'm her mom.

910
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,349
I know Su-yeon.

911
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,350
This isn't the kind of
thing Su-yeon would do.

912
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,860
Something must happened.

913
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:07,400
She's not the one who
hides without warning.

914
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,449
Right? Darling.

915
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,660
Don't you think so?

916
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:13,530
Yeah.

917
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,500
So.

918
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:21,000
I called the police.

919
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,920
I should have called the police earlier.

920
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,300
Right.

921
01:16:27,301 --> 01:16:29,220
The police will be at
your house tomorrow.

922
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,180
My place?

923
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,850
Don't be salty.

924
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,640
They're not doing this
because they suspect you,

925
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,730
they're just confirming it.

926
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,020
Anyway.

927
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,110
Are you doubting me now?

928
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:56,830
Doubt?

929
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:59,460
About what?

930
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:05,460
Oh, really.
It's so perfunctory.

931
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:08,130
This is a civil servant,

932
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,680
perfunctorily looking
for something,

933
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,390
is he looking for my buried body.

934
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:16,350
Well.

935
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,430
Don't take it personally.

936
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,270
We do what we're told.

937
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:23,689
In fact, when doing so,

938
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,940
watching your expression
change is our technique

939
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:29,190
to see what the reaction is.

940
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:32,610
How's my reaction?

941
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,780
Clear.

942
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,370
Clean.

943
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,330
Pure.

944
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,380
Don't make fun of
me because it's small.

945
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,751
Is it because the place is
too small and you feel stuffy?

946
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,180
It's more comfy.

947
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:26,810
My place is too big.

948
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:32,270
I don't like that.

949
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,480
My place.

950
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,080
1117

951
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:52,130
What?

952
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,090
The password is 1117.

953
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,760
Why?

954
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:02,970
The password is the same
as Su-yeon's birthday.

955
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,020
Oh really?

956
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:12,060
I just continue to use the one set up
by the person who lived there before me.

957
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:14,780
What a coincidence.

958
01:20:14,781 --> 01:20:15,990
It's her birthday?

959
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,410
I was never very good at these things.

960
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:33,710
Here.

961
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,170
Check this.

962
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:39,089
Conductor,
I've seen this a hundred times.

963
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:40,470
Check first.

964
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,560
Oh here.

965
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,890
Check the mirror behind Su-yeon.

966
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,230
There's a hand.

967
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,530
It belongs to others.

968
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,199
I didn't see it before

969
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,720
because I only noticed Su-yeon's face,

970
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,490
but today I suddenly felt weird,

971
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,330
so I looked and

972
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:09,950
found a hand.

973
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,210
Can you see it?

974
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,540
Yes.

975
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:20,340
Someone was with her when she left.

976
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,760
What's up.

977
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,100
You miss me?

978
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:31,940
Yeah.

979
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,690
You're so romantic.

980
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:38,530
Don't ring the doorbell.
Just enter the code.

981
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,190
1117

982
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,710
No one's been particularly mean to me.

983
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:00,460
Everyone's been very nice.

984
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:05,090
I've gotten to know the
cello group really well,

985
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:09,060
and last time I had
dinner with the principal.

986
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,850
Yeah, he's so nice.

987
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,730
That's the way to lose your temper.
That's the way to be a leader.

988
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,230
I should learn.

989
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,070
Yeah. There's someone.

990
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,279
The conductor.

991
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,740
You know her.

992
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,289
It's only the winds that are wrong,

993
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,290
but she's only mad at the strings,

994
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:36,749
and if it wasn't for her, we'd have a
really good orchestra atmosphere, right?

995
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:37,750
Yeah.

996
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,800
Why you don't eat it?

997
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:53,640
I have a question.

998
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:55,770
What?

999
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,600
You were with Su-yeon when
she ran away, weren't you?

1000
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,570
What are you talking about?

1001
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,650
I saw your wrist in the mirror.

1002
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:09,410
The bracelet.

1003
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,990
Bracelet with blue stones

1004
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,540
you didn't wear it.

1005
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,330
Blue stones?

1006
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,970
This one?

1007
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:46,030
Yeah.

1008
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,200
I was in her room the day she ran away.

1009
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,120
So you've been lying all this time?

1010
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,379
You lied about Su-yeon
contacting you the day she left,

1011
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:02,540
about not knowing her well,

1012
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,880
and about coming to our house

1013
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,130
for the first time.

1014
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:10,390
Sorry.

1015
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,140
But can you not say it's your house?

1016
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,390
What?

1017
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,730
What's the purpose?

1018
01:24:25,731 --> 01:24:26,891
Why are you doing this to me?

1019
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:29,990
She let me do this.

1020
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:32,740
She asked me to help her
remodel the house, so I did.

1021
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,080
She said she wanted me to
help her run away, so I did.

1022
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:39,080
It was also because she
asked me to fill in for her.

1023
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,960
I just did what she told me to do.

1024
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,370
What are you talking about?

1025
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,000
Are you a servant who does
what she tells you to do?

1026
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49,350
Are you under her command?
Are you her slave?

1027
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,680
Am I the slave?

1028
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:55,600
The only thing I've decided to do on my own

1029
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,850
seems to be sleeping with you.

1030
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,730
Where is Su-yeon?

1031
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:08,610
You must know.

1032
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:10,490
I really don't.

1033
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,280
Stop lying.

1034
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:17,700
You two like each other, don't you?

1035
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,160
Like?

1036
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,460
I saw the photo.

1037
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,210
You two.

1038
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:31,470
What do you mean?

1039
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:36,220
It's like a child's joke,

1040
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,600
akin to a friendship pledge.

1041
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:40,770
Stop.

1042
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:44,440
Tell me.

1043
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,320
Where is she?

1044
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:48,530
I don't know.

1045
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:54,240
Really. I don't know.

1046
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,720
I turned the water off.

1047
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,220
It's me.

1048
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,280
It's me.

1049
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:42,750
Turn on the water.

1050
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,120
Okay.

1051
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,240
Here.

1052
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:23,500
Su-yeon?

1053
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,710
Turn it off.

1054
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:46,440
Su-yeon, are you in this house?

1055
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,150
Are you locked up?

1056
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,819
I'm being held captive.
Get me out of here.

1057
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,780
Get me out of here, Sung-jin.

1058
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,900
Su-yeon.

1059
01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,700
Are you there?

1060
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:01,530
Su-yeon...

1061
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,119
Sung-jin, here.

1062
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,119
Right in front of you.

1063
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,670
Just here. Hey!

1064
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:20,590
I'm here!

1065
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,800
Su-yeon.

1066
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,850
Are you in？

1067
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,940
Yes! I am!

1068
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,240
You are there.

1069
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:41,030
Yes.

1070
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,850
Why?

1071
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:07,390
Oh.

1072
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:09,940
Don't go.

1073
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,820
What's wrong?

1074
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:22,860
What's wrong?

1075
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,080
So you saw it all there, too.

1076
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:33,210
Right?

1077
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:36,090
What I did with Mi-joo.

1078
01:29:38,630 --> 01:29:39,840
You saw it all.

1079
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:44,140
It doesn't matter.
Just get me out of here. I don't care.

1080
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,469
I don't care anymore.
Let me out of here.

1081
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,849
Help me.

1082
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:54,769
Mi-joo came here because she knew about it.

1083
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:55,770
Yes?

1084
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,690
To show you.

1085
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,860
Yeah?

1086
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:06,830
She knew you were watching.

1087
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,330
I don't care.

1088
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,539
Really, I don't.

1089
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,709
- Ah, fuck!
- It really doesn't matter.

1090
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,380
I won't take it in mind.

1091
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:18,130
You...

1092
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:20,379
What's wrong?

1093
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,089
Please save me.

1094
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:23,509
Sung-jin, help me.

1095
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:24,680
Please, help me.

1096
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:26,390
Please, please.

1097
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:30,470
Help me out.

1098
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:36,060
Please get me out.

1099
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,070
It's her fault.

1100
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:44,660
She used me and then dumped me.

1101
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:46,510
And that's why you're imprisoning her?

1102
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:48,450
It's not me.

1103
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:51,330
She walked in there.

1104
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:55,080
But something went wrong.

1105
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:59,090
I just didn't release her.

1106
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:02,819
That's the same.

1107
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:03,820
No.

1108
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,670
Imprison is crime.

1109
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,060
Get her out.

1110
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,320
Is being kind.

1111
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:21,220
I don't have kindness for her now.

1112
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:27,630
She's a bitch.

1113
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:31,010
Only use people,

1114
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:32,290
and dump them.

1115
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,020
So what are you going to do?

1116
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:38,319
Just lock her up?

1117
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,630
What if she will die of hunger?

1118
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,140
That's the point.

1119
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:43,260
There shouldn't be any food.

1120
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:47,150
Mi-joo.

1121
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,310
It's like murder, no.

1122
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:51,820
It is murder.

1123
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,130
What do you want me to do?

1124
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,590
Get her out.

1125
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:59,570
And say sorry, I'm kidding?

1126
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:02,730
She will say, it's okay,
I made mistakes.

1127
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,240
And that's it?

1128
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:05,959
But it's not right.

1129
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,440
You know her.

1130
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:09,240
Not just me.

1131
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:12,400
She's gonna make us both accomplices

1132
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,500
and put us in jail together.

1133
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:18,910
That's why you're on my side now, isn't it,

1134
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,899
because you're scared,

1135
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:24,300
or you'd have called the police
or a professional to save her.

1136
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:25,940
Or what do you want?

1137
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,040
You're gonna keep her
in there until she dies?

1138
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,060
I don't know.

1139
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:45,320
Now that you know about it, I feel good.

1140
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:47,820
You make the decision.

1141
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:49,410
I'll follow your decision.

1142
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:51,090
No matter what.

1143
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,660
You won't forgive me.

1144
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,390
It's been really hard for
me to get here, damn it.

1145
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,800
The moment you come out,
you're gonna wipe me out.

1146
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,690
You're gonna pulverize me.

1147
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,860
Right.

1148
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,750
I'm guilty.

1149
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:49,770
Yeah.

1150
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,060
Shit.

1151
01:33:58,770 --> 01:33:59,940
But Su-yeon.

1152
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,500
You lied.

1153
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:05,150
You like women.

1154
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:08,810
Don't you?

1155
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:58,250
Good, good.

1156
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,810
Wow, today's general
rehearsal was really great.

1157
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,320
We need more cooperation.

1158
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:05,520
Sit.

1159
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:10,860
But I think it's great.

1160
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:16,360
I thought today was the day of the show.

1161
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,170
But why do you have such
a dark look on your face?

1162
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,200
Me?

1163
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:27,210
Are you hiding something?

1164
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,520
No.

1165
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:38,580
Have you heard anything about Su-yeon?

1166
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:43,030
No.

1167
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:44,910
Ah.

1168
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,840
You guys are just now getting your act
together, and it's a real pain in the ass.

1169
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,780
Su-yeon

1170
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:56,180
left because she doesn't like you.

1171
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:58,910
But as her mom, I'm hiring you.

1172
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,260
No, give you promotion.

1173
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,230
I don't think she'll come
back if we keep this up.

1174
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:07,160
It's a really sudden idea.

1175
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,960
If Su-yeon won't come back in this way,

1176
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,210
how am I going to handle
my relationship with you?

1177
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:16,620
Frustrating.

1178
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,600
Right?

1179
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,910
It was supposed to be a fun day.

1180
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:48,940
-=Su-yeon(2)=-

1181
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:54,070
-=Su-yeon ...it's me.=-

1182
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:03,780
-=She Are you happy without me?=-

1183
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,049
What are you going to do?

1184
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:16,310
Mi-joo, cheer up.

1185
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:19,850
If she's gone, that means she's alive.
We haven't committed a serious crime.

1186
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:22,690
That's you.

1187
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:24,620
But.

1188
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,170
I've committed a great crime.

1189
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:29,020
That's better than killing someone.

1190
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,340
I checked.

1191
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,710
The keys are in my bag.
They're intact.

1192
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,340
I doubted you.

1193
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:45,440
What?

1194
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,060
Yeah.

1195
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,430
I mean.

1196
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,700
Let's just

1197
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:55,530
wait and see.

1198
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,380
It's not an easy place to get out.

1199
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,409
Calm down.

1200
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:03,410
No.

1201
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,440
Open it.

1202
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,630
Or I'll call the police.

1203
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,289
The conductor suddenly had an emergency

1204
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:25,970
and had to cancel the afternoon rehearsal.

1205
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:27,930
And, cellist Kim Mi-joo,

1206
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,449
has gone to the hospital

1207
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:33,030
because she's not feeling well.

1208
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:34,630
That's all.

1209
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:37,610
Off you go.

1210
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:42,720
So scaring.

1211
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,700
What's that?

1212
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:46,680
After reading the text,

1213
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:49,660
he'll come running to this room
if he hasn't committed a crime,

1214
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,240
or leave early if he has.

1215
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:53,330
Wow.

1216
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:55,839
So an agent can open the same phone number

1217
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,599
as long as they have a copy

1218
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,000
of their ID card.

1219
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,350
They must have never dreamed

1220
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:04,950
of falling into a trap.

1221
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,750
I'm... scared.

1222
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,060
What have they done?

1223
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,060
I'm so scared.

1224
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,350
It's the enter?

1225
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,790
Behind here is the secret room.

1226
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,860
How can you open this?

1227
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,080
Sung-jin.

1228
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:33,740
There's no way out of here.

1229
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,160
How do you open it?

1230
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:39,230
I told you there's no way out of here.

1231
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,440
Mi-joo.

1232
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,470
Su-yeon.

1233
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:13,120
Su-yeon, are you okay?

1234
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:15,960
See?

1235
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:18,990
There's no easy way out of here.

1236
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,930
What the hell was that text message about?

1237
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:31,730
Su-yeon.

1238
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:37,940
Are you alright?

1239
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:41,890
She's alive.

1240
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:46,570
Su-yeon.

1241
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,370
Wake up.

1242
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,880
Su-yeon.

1243
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:56,930
Su-yeon, enough.

1244
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,300
Su-yeon, enough.

1245
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:02,460
She's out of her mind.

1246
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:03,220
She's crazy.

1247
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:04,930
- Let go of me.
- Let's get out of here.

1248
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:05,990
- She's crazy.
- Let go of me.

1249
01:42:05,991 --> 01:42:07,329
Sung-jin, let's get out of here.

1250
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,000
- Let go of me.
- She's out of her mind.

1251
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:11,050
- Let's get out of here.
- Let go of me.

1252
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,500
Let me go.

1253
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:17,770
Su-yeon.

1254
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:28,450
Get up.

1255
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,050
Are you okay?

1256
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:33,940
Let's go out, Sung-jin.

1257
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:35,710
I'm on my own.

1258
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,920
Get some rest. Eat something.

1259
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:02,260
I'm going to the police.

1260
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,220
No need.

1261
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,080
Don't.

1262
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:12,530
I'm hungry.

1263
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,910
Order some food.

1264
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,240
Kimchi soup.

1265
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:27,700
Okay.

1266
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,040
I'll take a shower first.

1267
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:37,510
I really want to take a shower.

1268
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:46,930
Help me take it off.

1269
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:18,170
Mi-joo.

1270
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,170
You are there.

1271
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,560
I'm gonna take a shower now.

1272
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:30,810
Hot shower.

1273
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:37,090
Hey.

1274
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:39,220
Try being an idiot like me.

1275
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:40,710
You know.

1276
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:42,270
I won't give you water.

1277
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,660
I'll tell you the rest

1278
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:50,370
when I've had a shower, Mi-joo.

1279
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:55,190
Hey.

1280
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:56,900
Hey!

1281
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,450
I was worried when you never contacted me.

1282
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:13,240
I didn't expect you to show up
and give me the rest of the money.

1283
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:14,990
That's Shin Su-yeon.

1284
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:17,290
How's Mi-joo?

1285
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,060
Teacher

1286
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,720
You know right?

1287
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:22,360
About you?

1288
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,630
I'm the teacher.

1289
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,090
I'm getting married with Sung-jin.

1290
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:30,310
And our relationship has gotten weird.

1291
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:31,950
But.

1292
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:34,550
I'm still not going to break it off.

1293
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:38,330
I can't lose her.

1294
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:42,740
I used to look at you and think,

1295
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:46,450
“No one can win her possessiveness."

1296
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:48,950
You got everything.

1297
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,700
My house is yours.

1298
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,430
Well, that's true.

1299
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:09,770
But.

1300
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:13,740
Did you say something bad

1301
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,830
about me to Mi-joo,

1302
01:46:18,370 --> 01:46:20,130
that I'm the one who
uses and then discards?

1303
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:25,470
I liked you before.

1304
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,080
Flowers are pretty.

1305
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:40,890
And teacher,

1306
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:44,000
your house is so good.

1307
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:46,280
So good.

1308
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,880
Really.

1309
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:50,650
It's a house that brings happiness.

1310
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:12,310
-=Alarm=-

1311
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:39,020
Do you go golfing?

1312
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:42,620
I woke you up.

1313
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:43,930
No.

1314
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,880
I gotta get up.

1315
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:50,290
Looks like you're totally into golf.

1316
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:52,890
It's fun.

1317
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,330
Mom,

1318
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:58,360
asks me to go next week.

1319
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I know.

1320
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:02,070
Get more sleep.

1321
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:03,390
I'll be back.

1322
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,960
Have fun.

1323
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:53,290
Locked up?

1324
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,800
Give me the key.

1325
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,000
You look good.

1326
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:03,810
Are you waiting for me?

1327
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:06,310
Yeah.

1328
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:18,890
Take it off.

1329
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:57,730
