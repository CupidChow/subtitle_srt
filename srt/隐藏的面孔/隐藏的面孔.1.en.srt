1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's you.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Me, Sungjin.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You were a little surprised.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was going to talk about my face directly.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But I think I'll be better if I see your face.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I'm leaving again.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Berlin.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't know either.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sungjin's relationship with Sungjin is not a promise.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know, Sungjin.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I'm so angry and worried about everything.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I'm lonely.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm so lonely right now.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't think I have any self-esteem.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is it right to be a little strange?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not that I'm a good person, but I'm a good person.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I'll leave.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm so happy that I have you.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I'm happy to be happy.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm so happy.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm so happy.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The second song of the first year.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll do it.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
One, two, three.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll do it.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Jijeon.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, Sungjin.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You look like you're in a relationship.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Me?

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Anyway, I tell you that I'm always the one who can't keep on acting.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, you're not right because of the hot weather.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But you're not right because of the hot weather.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I know you're waiting for Suyeon, but you're hiding behind her.

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think you should tell her.

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, I'll do it quickly.

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Did you know?

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm Geese.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Drink it.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is it December?

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, that's about it.

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think I've never been to Berlign.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think I've been to the cellar and I don't have to go anywhere.

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't worry too much.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What did you do to me?

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What did you do to me?

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I was going to eat the room service.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I was wrong.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When I was young, I was so scared.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I was so scared.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was so scared.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was so scared.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was so scared.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was so scared.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I was so scared.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was so scared.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I was so scared.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I came to see you in the cellar.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to the cellar now.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To the cellar?

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes, but you said you were going to call me.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You know?

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You were just checking your cellar.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But I have to wait a little longer.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is that so?

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, I came back to the cellar.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think I should be disappointed if there's a replacement.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Honey.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I heard that the third president said it's harder to wait for you.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I heard that you have to take the replacement.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have to take the replacement.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to take the replacement.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But you're the president.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But I'm going to tell you something.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't do it to me.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Mr. Lee.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's...

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please do it.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Please do it.

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Please do it.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not going to be a bad student.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's the same teacher.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Park Hyun-suk.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And when I was preparing for my entrance exam, I was going to school.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I told you to stay here and stay here.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you have anything else to say?

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was worried about the call.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Did you get any wrong?

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go in.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Actually, I'm going to talk to you about the date.

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you're okay, can you please listen to me first?

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yet, I couldn't understand you passed away.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to subscribe your channel to read the worries.

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Take it easy.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hello?

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Wer are you calling me?

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I like to play the shiver.

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The reason is because I'm sad.

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If I hear it, the music is sad.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not sad.

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So I like it the most.

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll go to the profile.

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Throw away the trash.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll go to the USB.

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll put it in the inside and put it in the other one.

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Or throw away.

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I came to meet you.

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I like to play the shiver.

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The reason is because I'm sad.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sad.

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What's going on here?

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not going to be sad.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sad.

131
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sad because I'm sad.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I feel a little different from the other.

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think I'm going to the hospital.

134
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

137
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know.

138
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I like to play.

139
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sad.

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Please cheer for us.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Really?

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's good.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you sad?

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sad.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We're in the park.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think it's a little warm.

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Come practice.

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Actually, I like to play shiver.

151
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The reason is...

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The reason is...

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sad because I hate to get upset.

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ice There are many people looking for this.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000

Did you sleep well today?

182
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Well, it's my first time.

183
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,300
I have to keep it a little longer.

184
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Still, there's something like a misunderstanding.

185
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Do you feel it?

186
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Well.

Then be comfortable with rest.

191
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,300
And you don't have any winter flags.

192
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
It's okay if you don't feel any bad.

193
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm satisfied with the amount of money.

194
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
That's a waste of money, right?

195
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,300
What is it?

196
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
I'm satisfied with the amount of money.

197
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Why are you so angry?

198
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
You're satisfied with the amount of money you have.

199
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I can do it.

200
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Are you crazy?

201
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
I usually do that often.

202
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm not that good at it.

203
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
But I don't want to do it now.

204
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Yes.

205
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
This is the cat.

206
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
What?

207
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Can't you come quickly?

208
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
What's the best?

209
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
The closet is here.

210
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Are you hungry?

211
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Yes.

212
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Yes.

213
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
The cell phone looks too small.

214
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,300
It looks so big in my car.

215
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,300
How about you?

216
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
I'll go inside.

217
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
When did you come?

218
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
Ah...

219
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I came to the convenience store.

220
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
I saw the window.

221
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Really?

222
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,300
It's so cold.

223
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Do you want to eat dinner?

224
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Yes, I like it.

225
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,300
But I like to eat meat.

226
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
I used to use my hand when I was a kid.

227
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
I can do it.

228
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Do you have a complex?

229
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
I don't like it.

230
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Yes.

231
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
If you eat too well,

232
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
you should always eat it.

233
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
It's so cold.

234
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I don't have a big umbrella.

235
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
But it's so cold.

236
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,300
But I heard that the two of you are having a problem.

237
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Did you fight?

238
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
You left?

239
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
I didn't mean it.

240
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I also have a complex.

241
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
What?

242
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm a bear.

243
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,300
I lived with the two of you when I was a bear.

244
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,300
I lived with the same animal.

245
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,300
Mom?

246
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Dad?

247
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,300
It's cold.

248
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
So I have a complex.

249
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Ta-da.

250
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Isn't it right to be behind me?

251
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm going to sleep.

252
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
If you come to the office,

253
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,300
you'll be home first.

254
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
You'll be home first.

255
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
I'll be home first.

256
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
When I'm home,

257
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
I'll be home first.

258
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,300
You're the only one who's in front of me.

259
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm 5th.

260
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
I'm 5th.

261
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,300
I heard that you were in the dorm.

262
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I want to eat more.

263
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm going to eat all of them.

264
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I'm going to sleep.

265
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
What's the matter?

266
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
What?

267
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

268
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Where?

269
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

270
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm home.

271
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I don't know why I'm drinking water.

272
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
It's a good night's day.

273
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I don't know why I'm drinking water.

274
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
But you don't know me.

275
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,360
and eat it.

276
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,880
The appointment is sacutious, too.

277
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
I only eat university supplement.

278
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,900
Actually, I don't know the architecture of the affordable delicious food.

279
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,680
The water closes now.

280
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:06,080
It could be better that drink ginseng later than no peas soup.

281
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,740
I just ordersn't you drink it.

282
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,780
Then choose who you don't normally...

283
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,340
read carefully.

284
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I like home very much.

285
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm so drunk.

286
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
I'm a drunk.

287
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,740
I'm a drunk.

288
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,740
I'm a drunk.

289
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
I'm a drunk.

290
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
I'm a drunk.

291
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm a drunk.

292
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,740
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,740
I'm a drunk.

294
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,740
You're in this room.

295
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
You can't do this in this room.

296
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,740
This is not it.

297
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,740
How can I get a girl out of this?

298
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,740
I'm a drunk.

299
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,740
I'm a drunk.

300
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
I was drunk.

301
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
I'm a drunk.

302
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,740
What should I do?

303
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm a drunk.

304
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm a drunk.

305
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm a drunk.

306
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
That's the cat's cat.

307
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
He eats coffee and poop.

308
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
It's interesting.

309
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
Yes.

310
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
What's the situation?

311
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,740
It's strange to be so angry and so busy.

312
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,740
You look like that.

313
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,740
It's not important to be honest.

314
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
How can people see?

315
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,740
It's a watch.

316
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,740
So, you have to be honest.

317
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,740
It's a watch.

318
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
But it's a watch.

319
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,740
It's a watch.

320
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,740
Isn't it strange?

321
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740
It's a Corona.

322
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,740
The house is different.

323
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,740
It's more like that.

324
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,740
It's strange.

325
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,740
You know what's the most strange thing.

326
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,740
The house.

327
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,740
I used my card to kill you.

328
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,740
But I called the card.

329
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
It's strange.

330
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,740
I wanted to pay you a lot of attention.

331
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:54,740
So I wanted to be very calm.

332
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,740
That's right.

333
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
I'm so worried.

334
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,740
Is it a watch that's not important to you?

335
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,740
I know.

336
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,740
Yesterday, rain came a lot.

337
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Isn't that my fault?

338
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,740
It's the rest of the fault.

339
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
It's a lot of things to drink.

340
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,740
I went home.

341
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,740
I went into the kitchen.

342
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,740
I don't think I can do it again.

343
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,740
I'll answer the question of the manager.

344
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Let's understand.

345
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,740
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Hello?

347
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,740
Hello?

348
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
Where is MRE?

349
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,740
Millie, Mummy

350
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,740
Are you sure?

351
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Mari...

352
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,740
Two remain.

353
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
I don't know.

354
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
I'm sorry.

355
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
I'm okay.

356
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,740
I'm so sorry.

357
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,740
I'm so sorry.

358
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
I'm sorry.

359
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,740
What's wrong?

360
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
I'm so sorry.

361
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I'm so sorry.

362
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Are you okay?

363
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm okay.

364
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Are you okay?

365
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
Are you okay?

366
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,740
Are you okay?

367
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
What are you doing?

368
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,740
What are you doing?

369
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
I'm so sorry.

370
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,740
I was just trying to get a chance.

371
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Where's the other half?

372
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
I don't know.

373
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,740
I can't come out.

374
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,740
I'll come to this side after I see my son.

376
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
I'm so sorry.

377
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
I'm okay.

378
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Sungjae, let's go to the Americano.

379
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
It's going to smell.

380
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
What?

381
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,740
No, it's me.

382
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Please come in here.

383
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,740
I can't imagine when I come out of the park.

384
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
I'm just bored.

385
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
I'll give you a kid.

386
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
I'll do the wedding.

387
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
I'll do the wedding.

388
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,740
You two did the wedding.

389
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
It's an interior.

390
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,740
I said I'd do it, but I don't know if it's the best.

391
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,740
I saw the wedding before.

392
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,740
I was doing it because I was okay and okay.

393
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,740
Of course, it's my hobby.

394
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,740
What do you mean by a professional?

395
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Of course.

396
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,740
I'm not getting a hobby.

397
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,740
I'm just getting a chance.

398
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
Isn't this a bit like that?

399
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
That's the same.

400
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,740
Thank you.

401
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
Thank you.

402
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
Isn't it a bit like that?

403
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Right?

404
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,740
Okay.

405
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Oh, coffee.

406
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
Thank you.

407
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
I'm going to get a drink.

408
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,740
Do you like it?

409
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,740
It's so good.

410
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,740
When I was a student, my teacher was not interested in my class.

411
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I was just sitting there.

412
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Good.

413
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
I'm sitting there.

414
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,740
Good.

415
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Good, Sang-hee.

416
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:40,740
I can make a big deal of money and earn a lot of money.

417
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,740
I dreamed about this place.

418
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,740
I never dreamed of it.

419
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
Why?

420
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,740
Don't you like it?

421
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,740
I like it, so I'm a little bit more than a person.

422
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I can live.

423
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,740
You have to be mature.

424
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,740
What?

425
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Everything.

426
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,740
I know what you're doing.

427
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Do you know why?

428
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,740
Sang-hee is a master.

429
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,740
A master.

430
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,740
A master is a natural thing.

431
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,740
We don't have to do anything like this to our mom.

432
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Don't go too far.

433
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
It's not a burden.

434
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
It's not a habit.

435
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,740
It's natural for all of you.

436
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,740
Okay?

437
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,740
Our master.

438
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,740
I heard that you're a real man.

439
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
What?

440
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,740
I heard that you're a real man.

441
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,740
You're a real man.

442
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
Really?

443
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
Wow.

444
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
You're a real man.

445
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
You're a real man.

446
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
Wow.

447
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
Sang-hee, look at this.

448
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,740
It's amazing, right?

449
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Don't look at this.

450
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,740
Wow, it's not a joke.

451
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,740
It's 3,000 won for 5 bucks, so it's a little bit pricey.

452
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Do you like it?

453
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,740
Yes.

454
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,740
You're going to take a shower after the concert.

455
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,740
But I'm going to do it a little longer because it's a mature.

456
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Do you have a gift?

457
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
I'll give you a gift.

458
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,740
I'll give you a gift.

459
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,740
I'll give you a gift.

460
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Ta-da.

461
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,740
Oh, that's good.

462
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
Sang-hee.

463
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Can I have a drink?

464
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Sure.

465
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,740
But what are you doing?

466
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm going to sleep.

467
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
You look good.

468
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,740
Oh, my mother can't tell you because she's meeting you?

469
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
Yes.

470
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,740
You like it, right?

471
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,740
You're so sweet and you're going to sleep well.

472
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:15,740
But I thought about it and I saw it again.

473
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,740
You were a really good person.

474
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,740
You were so mean and you were so thoughtful.

475
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,740
You felt how strong your song was.

476
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,740
Why are you not here?

477
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,740
Just because I felt it.

478
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,740
I felt it.

479
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,740
I was always like this.

480
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I liked it more.

481
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm so happy.

482
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,740
I'm so worried.

483
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,740
But I'm glad I'm successful and successful.

484
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Right?

485
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
How was it?

486
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
Where?

487
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
I heard you were a good person.

488
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
I like you.

489
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
You're good at it.

490
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,740
I don't feel good.

491
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,740
You said you'd take care of your kids.

492
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,740
Really?

493
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,740
I told you to do it because I was a good person.

494
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Of course.

495
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,740
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

496
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
I didn't think that.

497
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Really?

498
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Okay.

499
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,740
Then...

500
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
Are you going to make a reservation?

501
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,740
About 3,000 won per month.

502
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
You're so expensive.

503
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,740
I'm so embarrassed.

504
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,740
And you know,

505
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,740
I'm just a good person.

506
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
What should I say?

507
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,740
I like the best.

508
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,740
I'm a good person.

509
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
I'm a good person.

510
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,740
I'm a good person.

511
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
I'm a good person.

512
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,740
Let's go to the church.

513
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Okay.

514
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,740
Okay.

515
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Okay.

516
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,740
I'm going to the church.

517
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,740
I have to show you.

518
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
Okay.

519
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,740
How is it?

520
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,740
It's good.

521
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,740
I'm a little bit hungry now.

522
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,740
Let's go to the church to get a good rest.

523
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
Manager.

524
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,740
Get going.

525
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
Look at this.

526
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,740
It's coming up from the church.

527
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
I have to decide with you.

528
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Oh, I'm hungry.

529
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,740
The opening is a luxury church.

530
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,740
So I'm going to the church.

531
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,740
And then I'm going to the church.

532
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
This is a business program.

533
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
I think it's okay to live like this.

534
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,740
Of course. I'm so happy.

535
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,740
Oh, you have to go like this.

536
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,740
Of course.

537
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
I'm going to the church.

538
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Okay.

539
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,740
Did you talk to the violin before?

540
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
The violin?

541
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,740
Was it for the stage?

542
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,740
I think it's a lot of fun.

543
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Is that so?

544
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,740
I heard that the violin is a very creative way to play.

545
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,740
What?

546
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,740
I'm worried about the sound of the violin.

547
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
I'm going to break it.

548
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,740
What's wrong?

549
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,740
What?

550
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,740
Come to Seoul and say something.

551
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,740
What's wrong?

552
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
What's wrong?

553
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,740
I'm worried about the violin and everything.

554
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Why are you so upset about me?

555
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,740
I'm not a human being.

556
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,740
I'm not a human being.

557
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,740
What's wrong?

558
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
Please quit.

559
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,740
Should I teach this to you, too?

560
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,740
Well?

561
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Why is it that you make me care for it so?

562
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,740
I can't, really?

563
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Is that why I Hyo Sua has such a costly way of doing things?

564
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,740
wrecking purposes means you're letting loose your job only on aoscopy?

565
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,740
What about those people?

566
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,740
Because you plan to controversial with me and Sixties?

567
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
That's why...

568
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,220
Then why don't you look dressed like that and watch that movie for your first look?

569
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,240
Is that how you run without looking?

570
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,380
That sounds innocent and noisy.

571
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,540
HEEL IU

572
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:05,460
EXID

573
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,300
You did 8th.

574
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,560
Not this time!

575
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,560
I'm so bored.

576
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,560
I'm going to apologize.

577
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,560
I can do that.

578
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Did you not do it because of the house?

579
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
I didn't.

580
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,560
I guess I'm crazy. I thought you were a brunette.

581
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
You're so annoying.

582
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,560
I'm so bored.

583
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
I'm so bored.

584
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
I really like it.

585
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,560
I'm crazy about you, Sungjin.

586
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,560
You're handsome and smart.

587
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,560
You're not a good housewife, but you don't have a problem.

588
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,560
One is less.

589
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,560
What? I don't think I like you.

590
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,560
You like me.

591
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Are you crazy?

592
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,560
But I don't like you.

593
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,560
I don't like you, either.

594
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,560
That's natural.

595
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
What should I do?

596
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Of course.

597
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,560
So?

598
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,560
Are you hurt?

599
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,560
To me?

600
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
Yoo Jae-ah.

601
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,560
I used to be your first kiss.

602
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,560
Do you remember?

603
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,560
When?

604
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,560
After that teacher.

605
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,560
I was...

606
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,560
After that teacher.

607
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,560
I don't like you because of that day.

608
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,560
You were like that, too.

609
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,560
I'm betraying you now, but...

610
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,560
That's right. I'm betraying you.

611
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,560
But I'm betraying you.

612
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,560
I hope you know that.

613
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,560
I'll do it.

614
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,560
You're drunk.

615
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,560
Have you been in the car?

616
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Yes.

617
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,560
Then you're going to be with me?

618
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,560
You're so sweet.

619
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
You're so cool.

620
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,560
What if I'm just lying?

621
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,560
I have to like you.

622
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Come here.

623
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Did you bring the money?

624
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,560
Okay.

625
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,560
You have to do it like this.

626
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,560
You're angry?

627
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,560
I saved you.

628
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,560
I was living in a place where I didn't even have money.

629
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,560
I'm a bank of money.

630
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,560
I have to keep my safe.

631
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,560
I thought you were lying to me.

632
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,560
I'm the best.

633
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,560
What?

634
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,560
Anyway.

635
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,560
I want to see you more when I'm not here.

636
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,560
Is this a good thing?

637
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,560
Here.

638
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,560
What? Come here.

639
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,560
I'm going to go in.

640
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,560
I'm going to go in.

641
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Come here.

642
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Come here.

643
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Oh, good.

644
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,560
Wow.

645
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,560
You're always here.

646
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,560
I thought you were here.

647
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,560
I thought you were here.

648
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,560
You're scared.

649
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,560
What are you doing?

650
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,560
I'm scared.

651
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:08,560
From now on, I'll wait for you to go in.

652
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Okay?

653
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Like a girl,

654
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,560
I'll be a boy and be a boy.

655
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,560
You have to like me.

656
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Yes.

657
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,560
You like me, right?

658
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,560
I can't do this.

659
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,560
What are you doing?

660
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,560
You like me, Kyungho.

661
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,560
Okay, then.

662
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,560
I'll go in.

663
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,560
I'll go in.

664
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,560
I think you're not that kind of person.

665
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,560
Isn't that right?

666
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
It's not Sungjin's wrong.

667
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
It's my wrong.

668
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,560
So I'll leave.

669
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:33,560
I'm so happy that you're still here.

670
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,560
You're so sad, right?

671
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,560
Yes.

672
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,560
Oh, really.

673
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,560
You're watching this video, right?

674
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,560
You're so sad that you don't have a drink.

675
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,560
You're so sad.

676
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,560
Are you a little over here?

677
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
What?

678
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,560
You're a little over here.

679
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,560
But, are you a little over here?

680
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,560
Oh, I thought you were going to get a house.

681
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
Are you the most sad?

682
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,560
You're the best.

683
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,560
Oh, right.

684
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,560
You're a little over here, right?

685
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,560
You're suddenly out of your mind.

686
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,560
You're so sad that you're not sad.

687
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Are you all done?

688
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Yes.

689
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Good.

690
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Oh, come here.

691
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,560
You should be fine, too.

692
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,560
How much is it?

693
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,560
I don't know.

694
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,560
It's 3.3.

695
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
I'll use the bathroom.

696
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,560
I'll go in.

697
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,560
You're good at cleaning.

698
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
I'll go in.

699
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
Mom.

700
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,560
I'll go in.

701
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,560
I'll go in.

702
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Mom.

703
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Mom.

704
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,560
Mom.

705
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,560
It's me, Tae-jin.

706
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,560
Are you a little over here?

707
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,560
I'm a little over here.

708
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
I don't know either.

709
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
I'm sorry.

710
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,560
I'm sorry.

711
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,560
I don't have you.

712
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,560
I don't know.

713
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
I'm so angry.

714
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,560
I'm worried because there's no time for me to rest.

715
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,560
I'm so angry.

716
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,560
I'm so sorry.

717
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,560
I'm so sorry.

718
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
I'm sorry.

719
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,560
I'm so sorry.

720
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
I'm so sorry.

721
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,560
I'm so sorry.

722
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,560
I'm so sorry.

723
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
I'm so sorry.

724
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,560
I'm so sorry.

725
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,560
I'm so sorry.

726
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,560
I'm so sorry.

727
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,560
I'm so bad.

728
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,560
I'm so sorry.

729
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
I'm so sorry.

730
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
I'm so sorry.

731
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
Pull me in the clothes.

732
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Pull me in the clothes.

733
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
Pull me in the clothes.

734
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
Oh my god.

735
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,560
Pull me in the clothes.

736
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,560
Ah!

737
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,560
Ah!

738
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,560
Ah!

739
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,560
Ah!

740
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Ah!

741
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Ah!

742
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
Ah!

743
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
Ah!

744
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,560
Ah!

745
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,560
Ah!

746
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,560
Ah!

747
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,560
Ah!

748
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,560
I'm still sad, so I'm dying.

749
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Huh?

750
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,560
Let's see.

751
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
Ah!

752
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,560
Ah!

753
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Ah...

754
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,560
Ah!

755
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,560
Ah!

756
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,560
Ah!

757
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,560
Ah!

758
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,420
Hello, Soo...

759
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:05,420
Ms. Ha, come here, please come here!

760
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,960
Ms. Ha!

761
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,620
It's here she's here!

762
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,760
She left!

763
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,000
Hurry!

764
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,260
My goodness

765
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,520
My goodness

766
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,200
Hurry!

767
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,580
My goodness

768
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,500
Hadi, wake up

769
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,220
Hurry!

770
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:53,000
The Tree Yves

771
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,360
Get out!

772
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,620
I need to get some sleep.

773
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,400
Good night, good night!

774
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,940
You!

775
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,880
And how about some?

776
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,320
I'll drink it again.

777
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,880
soul

778
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,260
Alan

779
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,800
You're so cold

780
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,000
Mother

781
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:32,240
Bat

782
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,680
هم

783
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,680
Soon

784
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,680
Let's go

785
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,680
I'm sorry.

786
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,680
I'm sorry.

787
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,680
I'm sorry.

788
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,680
I'm sorry.

789
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,680
I thought you were serious.

790
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,680
Did you do it again?

791
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
Again?

792
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,680
How did you get in?

793
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,680
How did you get in my house?

794
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,680
I was drunk.

795
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,680
I was sleeping and I was sleeping.

796
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,680
I was so sleepy.

797
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,680
I want to eat something.

798
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,680
I'm crazy.

799
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,680
I'm so busy.

800
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,680
I'm so hungry.

801
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,680
I'm so angry.

802
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,680
I'm so sleepy.

803
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Should I take my phone?

804
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,680
Huh?

805
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,680
Should I take my phone?

806
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,680
I'm so sleepy.

807
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,680
I'm going to take a video.

808
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,680
I'm going to take a video.

809
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,680
What?

810
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,680
What?

811
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,680
What's wrong?

812
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,680
I'm so drunk.

813
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,680
I'm so drunk.

814
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,680
What are you doing?

815
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,680
Don't do this.

816
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,680
Why are you doing this?

817
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,680
I'm sorry.

818
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,680
I'm sorry.

819
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,680
Stop!

820
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,680
Stop!

821
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,680
Stop!

822
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,680
Stop!

823
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,680
Don't move!

824
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,680
Stop!

825
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,680
Stop!

826
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,680
Stop!

827
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
Stop!

828
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,680
Stop!

829
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,680
Stop!

830
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,680
Yes.

831
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,680
I'm fine.

832
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,680
I'm fine.

833
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,680
Stop!

834
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,680
Stop!

835
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,680
Stop!

836
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,580
Fire

837
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,120
If you do,

838
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,420
Wait!

839
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,020
Wait!

840
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,940
Wait!

841
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,400
Wait!

842
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,500
Wait!

843
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:53,300
Though the

844
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,300
If you buy it at home, it's good.

845
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It's almost there.

846
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,700
Yes, the flowers are so pretty.

847
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,500
But you're not going to be here, right?

848
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,900
Yes?

849
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,100
I thought I'd know.

850
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,700
I knew you two were going in here.

851
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,500
I'm sorry.

852
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,100
I'm sorry, I can't see you.

853
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,200
I thought you two were going to be young.

854
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,700
But you've been living here for a long time.

855
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,000
You're going to live with me again?

856
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,600
What's your space in this area?

857
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,700
I was curious.

858
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,800
When you were in your 20s, you made a choice.

859
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,800
You were in the 70s, the 70s, the 70s.

860
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,500
That's what I meant.

861
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:59,100
So you all the bad days in the trash that you gave birth to.

862
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,100
So you promised to Raj son, it's always been your first place here waiting for you?

863
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,320
As soon as you go back,

864
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:13,300
you can all the women go on the streets in your Lee-Hansuk area to stop you.

865
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,400
You can be braided and you go in probation for your loved one.

866
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Really?

867
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,200
Excuse me cutting you shortly.

868
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,280
What?

869
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,800
How is it?

870
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:38,840
It's good.

871
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,320
This is a great product.

872
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,040
I wanted to taste it once.

873
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,320
I know.

874
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,500
I'm sorry.

875
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,500
Hey.

876
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
What are you doing?

877
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,500
You can call me if you want to call me.

878
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
I won't call you.

879
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,500
No, I'll call you if you want to call me.

880
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,500
I'm a girl.

881
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
I trust you.

882
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,500
I trust you.

883
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
I won't call you.

884
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,500
I'll call you if you want to call me.

885
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,500
I'll call you if you want to call me.

886
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
I'm sorry.

887
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
I'm hungry.

888
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,500
What?

889
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,500
I was going to send you the video to send you the video after the construction.

890
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,500
You didn't have a lot of money.

891
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,500
But you have a talent.

892
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,500
What?

893
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,500
I'm going to the library with someone when I'm in Seoul.

894
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,500
Who?

895
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Namjoo.

896
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
I'm married.

897
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
I met you here.

898
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
I'm going to the library with you.

899
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,500
Wow.

900
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
That's right.

901
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,500
Yes.

902
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,500
Wow, that's right.

903
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,500
Wow.

904
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Then what about you?

905
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,500
Yes.

906
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,500
Yes.

907
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,500
Congratulations.

908
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
I'm married.

909
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,500
I'm living with a man.

910
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
You're living with a real life, aren't you?

911
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
I'm living with a real life.

912
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
I'm living with a real life.

913
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
I'm living with a real life.

914
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
If I'm living with a real life,

915
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,500
I'm living with a real life.

916
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
Hey.

917
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,500
Oh.

918
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,500
I'll tell you the truth.

919
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
That's why I'm here.

920
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
You're...

921
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
I don't know where you are.

922
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
I don't know where you are.

923
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,500
I'm your dog.

924
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
You knew it.

925
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
Don't get drunk.

926
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,500
And...

927
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,500
I think I'm a crazy person.

928
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,500
I don't know.

929
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
I'm going to die.

930
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
I'm going to die.

931
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,500
I'm going to die.

932
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
I'm going to die.

933
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,500
If you come out,

934
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
I'll be in the police station.

935
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,500
No.

936
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,500
No.

937
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,500
No.

938
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
No.

939
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,500
No.

940
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,500
I was wrong.

941
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
I'll kill you.

942
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,500
I'll kill you.

943
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,500
I'll kill you.

944
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,500
Please don't get drunk.

945
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Open it.

946
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,500
I'm sure.

947
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,500
But there's nothing to say.

948
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,500
But...

949
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
What do you mean by what?

950
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,500
I know.

951
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
The truth is...

952
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,500
The truth is not the truth.

953
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,500
It's the truth that people think.

954
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Right?

955
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
I understand.

956
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,500
And...

957
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
That truth...

958
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
I don't need it.

959
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
What are you talking about?

960
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,500
I'm a man.

961
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
I'm going.

962
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,500
I'll live my life.

963
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,500
What?

964
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,500
I'm sorry, Hyun-ni.

965
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,500
I think I should keep doing this.

966
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,500
Lee Ju-ah.

967
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Lee Ju-ah! Lee Ju-ah!

968
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,500
I'm going.

969
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,500
I'm going.

970
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,500
I'm going.

971
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,500
I'm going.

972
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,500
I'm going.

973
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,500
I'm going.

974
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,500
Why?

975
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,500
I'm going to get a headache because of the cold.

976
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,500
Are you okay?

977
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,500
Why?

978
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,500
I'm really okay.

979
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,500
I didn't wake up.

980
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
I'm okay.

981
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
Yes.

982
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:18,500
I just need to get a headache.

983
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Or...

984
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,500
I'm going to kill one person.

985
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
I need to kill three people.

986
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
That's the truth.

987
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
But that's the truth.

988
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,500
But I'm not a good person.

989
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,500
I'm a lot of people.

990
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
I don't live here.

991
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
I'm going.

992
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,500
I'm going to kill one person.

993
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
I'm going to do it.

994
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,500
I'm going to get a headache.

995
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
You can go to the hospital today.

996
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,500
No.

997
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,500
No.

998
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,500
No.

999
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,500
No.

1000
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,500
No.

1001
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,500
No.

1002
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,500
No.

1003
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
No.

1004
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,500
No.

1005
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,500
You can't do this?

1006
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,500
No!

1007
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,500
No!

1008
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
No!

1009
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1010
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,500
I'm not going.

1011
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1012
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1013
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1014
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1015
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
I'm so sorry.

1016
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,500
I don't have any treatment.

1017
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,500
So why didn't you go out?

1018
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,500
I don't have any card use.

1019
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,500
I keep calling.

1020
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,500
I don't have any contact.

1021
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
I'm a big mother.

1022
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,500
I know Suyeon.

1023
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,500
I have something to do.

1024
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Nothing.

1025
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,500
I can't do anything like this.

1026
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,500
No.

1027
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
It's right, you're a child.

1028
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
You think so, too.

1029
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,500
Yes.

1030
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,500
So.

1031
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,500
I was in the police station.

1032
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,500
I have to be serious.

1033
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1034
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,500
I'm going to get a headache.

1035
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,500
Me?

1036
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,500
Don't think like that.

1037
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,500
It's not like that.

1038
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Just...

1039
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:41,500
Is it just a check?

1040
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Anyway.

1041
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,500
Are you serious?

1042
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,500
What?

1043
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,500
What are you talking about?

1044
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,500
I'm not serious.

1045
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Who said you're not a child?

1046
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,500
What did you find?

1047
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,500
Did you find out that I'm a criminal?

1048
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,500
No.

1049
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Don't be too sensitive.

1050
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,500
We're all getting sick.

1051
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,500
So, I'm telling you,

1052
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,500
I'm telling you to be a criminal.

1053
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
What's the reaction?

1054
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,500
What's the reaction?

1055
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,500
It's clear and clean.

1056
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
I'm telling you to be pure.

1057
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,500
Don't say you're a child.

1058
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
Don't say you're a child.

1059
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,500
You're so good at home.

1060
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
I'm comfortable.

1061
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Why are you so tall?

1062
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,500
I don't like that.

1063
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,500
My house.

1064
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,500
Where are you going?

1065
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,500
1 1, İyiしい.

1066
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,500
Huh?

1067
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,500
He's going to go to meet you on 1 1 1st day.

1068
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,500
What are you doing?

1069
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,500
The same as Joohyunk's girl.

1070
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,380
You will so easily eliminate yourself.

1071
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,040
Staatom images?

1072
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,340
finals

1073
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:13,520
I don't know, show me the image in black uniforms.

1074
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,800
Everyone, it's the best image.

1075
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,700
Ahem...

1076
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,540
Ahem's image.

1077
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,020
Ahem, you only use it when you run similar waves.

1078
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,180
Why?

1079
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,620
And when you use it,

1080
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,880
I only use it when you run in zero.

1081
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,880
Yes.

1082
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,880
Look at this.

1083
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Director, I have 100 coins.

1084
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,880
Wait a minute.

1085
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,880
Here.

1086
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:43,880
Look at the mirror behind you.

1087
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,880
There's a hand in the mirror.

1088
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,880
A different person.

1089
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,880
I don't know how to face the mirror.

1090
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,880
But it feels strange today.

1091
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,880
I know.

1092
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,880
There's a hand.

1093
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,880
What?

1094
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,880
When you go out, someone was with you.

1095
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,880
Together.

1096
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,880
I'm not sure.

1097
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,880
But I can feel it now.

1098
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,880
That's why I look at you.

1099
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,880
What?

1100
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,880
When you left the house, there was someone with you.

1101
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,880
I was with you.

1102
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,880
Together.

1103
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,880
What's up?

1104
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,880
I wanted to be with you.

1105
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,880
Yes.

1106
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Romance, listen to me.

1107
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,880
Don't listen to me.

1108
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
I'm just coming in.

1109
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,880
I'm going to be late.

1110
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,880
I'm going to be late.

1111
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,880
I don't have anyone who can see me.

1112
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,880
I think everyone is very nice and good at it.

1113
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,880
Especially, I was really close to the cello team.

1114
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,880
I ate the first one and the rice.

1115
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,880
It's really nice.

1116
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,880
I can feel the heat and charisma.

1117
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,880
I think I'll learn that.

1118
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,880
Oh, it's a hand.

1119
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,880
It's a hand.

1120
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,880
Why do you know the personality of the front?

1121
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,880
I mean, I met a guest in the corner.

1122
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,880
But I don't know the personality.

1123
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,880
If there's nothing, our orchestra will be really nice.

1124
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,880
Right?

1125
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,880
Why don't you eat?

1126
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,880
I'll ask you something.

1127
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,880
What?

1128
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,880
I had a chance to get out of the pool.

1129
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,880
What are you talking about?

1130
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,880
I'm so tired of that.

1131
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,880
That bracelet.

1132
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,880
That blue-doll necklace.

1133
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,880
Today.

1134
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,880
I'm going to be late.

1135
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,880
I'm going to be late.

1136
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,880
The blue-doll necklace.

1137
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,880
This one.

1138
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,880
That's right.

1139
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,880
I was in the room that day.

1140
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,880
I was going to be late.

1141
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,880
What?

1142
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,880
Are you all ready?

1143
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,880
Are you all ready?

1144
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,880
Are you all ready?

1145
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,880
Are you all ready?

1146
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,880
I'm sorry.

1147
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,880
But...

1148
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,880
Can't we not be at home?

1149
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,880
What's the goal? Why are you doing this to me?

1150
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,880
You're getting sick.

1151
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,880
You're getting home and getting home.

1152
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,880
You're getting home and getting home.

1153
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,880
You're getting sick and getting home.

1154
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,880
I'm not doing anything to you.

1155
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,880
What?

1156
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,880
Is it someone who's doing something to you?

1157
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,880
Is it someone?

1158
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,880
I'm really going.

1159
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,880
I think I'm doing something to my decision.

1160
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,880
I don't think I can do anything.

1161
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
I can't breathe.

1162
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,880
I know.

1163
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,880
I don't know that either.

1164
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,880
Don't worry.

1165
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,880
You two are in love now.

1166
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,880
You two are in love?

1167
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,880
I saw you in the movie.

1168
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,880
What are you doing?

1169
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,880
What are you talking about?

1170
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
You're just...

1171
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,880
You're just like a kid, aren't you?

1172
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,880
You're just like a kid.

1173
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,880
You're just like a kid.

1174
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,880
Don't say that.

1175
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,880
Tell me.

1176
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,880
Where's Soo-hyun?

1177
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,880
I really don't know.

1178
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:54,880
I really don't know.

1179
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,880
Why did you buy my clothes?

1180
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,880
What are you doing?

1181
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:11,880
2017 Restonate

1182
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,880
You're...

1183
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,880
You did it!

1184
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:27,840
Right, you said you kayaked your Für tram.

1185
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,160
Kyauxu,

1186
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,180
Oke

1187
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,520
Stay back!

1188
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:50,000
No, Nonti.

1189
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,500
They showered their faces in the darkness

1190
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,520
Hello?

1191
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:57,520
I don't need you

1192
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:00,780
So close

1193
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,420
Oh yes

1194
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:16,740
So close

1195
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,160
I'm dead

1196
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,880
Is it a sin?

1197
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,880
No.

1198
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,880
No.

1199
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,880
No.

1200
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,880
No.

1201
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,880
No.

1202
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,880
No.

1203
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,880
No.

1204
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,880
No.

1205
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,880
No.

1206
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,880
No.

1207
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,880
Are you in the same house?

1208
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,880
No.

1209
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,880
Are you with me?

1210
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,880
I'm gone. I can't see.

1211
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,880
I can't see.

1212
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,880
Seol-ah.

1213
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,880
Are you in the same house?

1214
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,880
Yes.

1215
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,880
Where are you?

1216
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,880
I'm in the same house.

1217
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,880
I'm in the same house.

1218
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,880
I'm in the same house.

1219
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,880
Seol-ah.

1220
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,880
Seol-ah.

1221
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,880
Seol-ah.

1222
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,880
Seol-ah.

1223
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,880
Seol-ah.

1224
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,880
I'm dead.

1225
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,880
Seol-ah.

1226
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,880
What are you doing?

1227
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,880
I'm here.

1228
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,880
I'm here.

1229
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,880
Seol-ah.

1230
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
Seol-ah.

1231
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
Seol-ah.

1232
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,880
I'm in the same house.

1233
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,880
Are you海?

1234
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,880
Mom, Mom!

1235
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,880
Mom, Mom, Mom!

1236
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,880
What is it?

1237
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,880
Why are you...

1238
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,880
Why are you...

1239
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,880
Why are you...

1240
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
Why are you...

1241
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,880
Why are you...

1242
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,880
Why are you...

1243
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,880
Why are you...

1244
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,880
Why are you...

1245
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
Why are you...

1246
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,880
You must have changed.

1247
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,880
Right?

1248
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,880
You're the one who's like me.

1249
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,880
You're the one who's like me.

1250
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,880
Do you want to see everything?

1251
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,880
I can't.

1252
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,880
I can't.

1253
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,880
I can't.

1254
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,880
I can't.

1255
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,880
I can't.

1256
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,880
You know what?

1257
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,880
Right?

1258
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,880
You want to see me.

1259
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,880
Right?

1260
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,880
I can't see you.

1261
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,880
You can't.

1262
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,880
You're not.

1263
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,880
You're not.

1264
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,880
You're not.

1265
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,880
You're not.

1266
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,880
You're.

1267
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,880
What are you doing?

1268
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,880
I'll be fine.

1269
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,880
I'll be fine.

1270
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,880
I'll be fine.

1271
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,880
I'll be fine.

1272
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
Wait for me.

1273
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,880
I'll be fine.

1274
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,880
I can't get you wrong.

1275
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,880
I only did this on purpose.

1276
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,880
I only did this on purpose.

1277
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,880
I only did this on purpose.

1278
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,880
I know.

1279
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,880
I did it on purpose.

1280
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,880
I'll be fine.

1281
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,880
I'll be fine.

1282
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,880
But what's wrong with you?

1283
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
I...

1284
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,880
I won't be given this.

1285
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,880
But what's wrong with you?

1286
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,000
But what's wrong with you?

1287
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
No, it's not.

1288
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It's different, right?

1289
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
The thing that's touching is the criminal.

1290
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
The thing that's being black is the black.

1291
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I don't have any black.

1292
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
It's just a bad person.

1293
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I'm just using people and throwing away.

1294
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
What are you going to do?

1295
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You're going to keep doing that?

1296
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
If you're going to kill the criminal, then...

1297
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
That's interesting.

1298
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'm going to have nothing to eat.

1299
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Miss.

1300
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Isn't this a murder?

1301
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Is this a murder?

1302
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Then what should I do?

1303
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Now I'm going to be black.

1304
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Oh, sorry.

1305
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
It was a joke.

1306
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Then you're going to be a good girl.

1307
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
You're going to end like this?

1308
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
But this isn't it.

1309
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You know what?

1310
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Of course I am.

1311
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I'm going to be black and black.

1312
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Isn't that why you came to me?

1313
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Is that because of that?

1314
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Or maybe because I called people who are in the police station

1315
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
and called people.

1316
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Then what should I do?

1317
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Will you keep doing that?

1318
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Until the death.

1319
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I don't know either.

1320
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I...

1321
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I know you, too.

1322
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I'm so comfortable.

1323
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I'm going to decide on Sung-il.

1324
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I'll follow you.

1325
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
What kind of decision?

1326
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Should I?

1327
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It's harder, right?

1328
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Seventeen.

1329
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
izers.

1330
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Westerners.

1331
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I'm Hidey.

1332
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I...

1333
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I can only workah tends to comfort the dog.

1334
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I can't even work, though.

1335
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I'm gonna bear witness.

1336
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Ye emotions are toolezw, yea?

1337
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,420
I'm gonna beat you by just one way, right?

1338
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:38,960
You'll hit me with your allen in place?

1339
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,700
Ye emotions...

1340
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,760
Munch you're dying, woah.

1341
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:50,060
Kyu happiness...

1342
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,060
Oh, no.

1343
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,060
You're a liar.

1344
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,060
You're a liar.

1345
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,060
You're a liar.

1346
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,060
Right?

1347
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:23,060
Oh, no.

1348
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,060
I'm sorry.

1349
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,060
Bravo. Bravo.

1350
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,060
Wow, I was so happy to be here today.

1351
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,060
You're still a little more.

1352
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:05,060
Sit down.

1353
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,060
Wow.

1354
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,060
I...

1355
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,060
I really like you.

1356
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:16,060
I thought you were going to be a concert today.

1357
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:19,060
But why are you so happy?

1358
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:21,060
Why?

1359
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,060
Did you...

1360
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,060
have something to say to me?

1361
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:30,060
I don't have anything like that.

1362
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,060
Do you have anything to say to Su-yeon?

1363
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,060
I don't have anything.

1364
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,060
Oh.

1365
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:49,060
I'm going to be a guest now.

1366
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:51,060
I'm sorry.

1367
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,060
Su-yeon is talking.

1368
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:56,060
I left without you.

1369
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,060
But I kept following you.

1370
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:02,060
If you're using me,

1371
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:05,060
I'll be able to come back to you.

1372
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,060
Are you really going to be a guest?

1373
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:12,060
If you keep following me like this,

1374
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:15,060
I'll be able to see you as a guest.

1375
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,060
I'm sorry.

1376
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,060
Right?

1377
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,060
I really like you.

1378
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:45,060
Su-yeon.

1379
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,060
What are you going to do?

1380
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,060
Su-yeon, let's go to the police station.

1381
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:20,060
We're not even going to be a guest since we're in love.

1382
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,060
You're right, right?

1383
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:26,060
But you're a big deal.

1384
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:29,060
But you're not a man.

1385
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,060
I checked it.

1386
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,060
There's a place in my bag for my fever.

1387
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:43,060
I've been working hard for you.

1388
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,060
What?

1389
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:47,060
Yes.

1390
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:52,060
You know, we're just...

1391
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:55,060
We can see it.

1392
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:58,060
It's not easy to get there.

1393
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,060
We'll be in the car.

1394
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,060
No.

1395
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,060
Go to the police station.

1396
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:08,060
I think you're going to die.

1397
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,060
The police are in the car,

1398
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,060
so they're going to the rehearsal.

1399
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:28,060
And the police.

1400
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,060
The police are in the car,

1401
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,060
so they're in the hospital.

1402
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:35,060
It's weird.

1403
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:38,060
Let's go out.

1404
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:43,060
What's this?

1405
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:45,060
What's this, sir?

1406
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,060
Look at the door.

1407
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,060
I want to escape with no reason.

1408
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:51,060
I'll do whatever I want.

1409
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:57,060
So if you have a new department,

1410
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,060
you can get the same number,

1411
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,060
so you can't find this.

1412
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:06,060
You're a completely different person.

1413
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,060
I'm so scared.

1414
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,060
What do you want to do?

1415
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:17,060
I'm so scared.

1416
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:20,060
Why are you here?

1417
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:26,060
I'm going to the police station.

1418
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:29,060
How do you do this?

1419
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,060
I can't.

1420
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,060
I can't.

1421
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:37,060
What are you doing?

1422
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:39,060
I can't.

1423
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,060
Lee Ju.

1424
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:03,060
Lee Ju.

1425
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:33,060
Lee Ju.

1426
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,060
Lee Ju.

1427
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:10,060
Su-yeol.

1428
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:14,060
Are you okay?

1429
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,060
Look at this.

1430
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:19,060
I can't see it easily here.

1431
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:24,060
I can't see it.

1432
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,060
I'm okay.

1433
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,060
Are you okay?

1434
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:42,060
I still have a baby.

1435
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,060
I'm okay.

1436
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,060
I'm going to the police station.

1437
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:56,060
Su-yeol.

1438
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:58,060
Stop it.

1439
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:01,060
Stop it.

1440
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,060
It's okay.

1441
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,060
Let's go out.

1442
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,060
We're going out.

1443
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,060
I think we're going out.

1444
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:12,060
Let's go out.

1445
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:14,060
Let's go out.

1446
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,060
Su-yeol.

1447
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,060
Su-yeol.

1448
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:29,060
Su-yeol.

1449
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:32,060
Lee Ju-yeol.

1450
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:34,060
Su-yeol.

1451
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,060
I'll go to the police station.

1452
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,060
I'm sorry.

1453
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:00,060
I'm so sorry.

1454
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,060
I'm sorry.

1455
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,060
No.

1456
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:10,060
I'm sorry.

1457
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:13,060
I'm sorry.

1458
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:15,060
Please forgive me.

1459
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:18,060
Are you okay?

1460
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:22,060
I'm sorry.

1461
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:34,060
I'll be back.

1462
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:38,060
I really wanted to be back.

1463
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:41,060
Ah.

1464
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,060
Please forgive me.

1465
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:11,060
I'm sorry.

1466
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:13,060
I'm sorry.

1467
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:20,060
Lee Ju-yeol.

1468
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,060
Are you right in front of the mirror?

1469
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:31,060
I'm going to shower now.

1470
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,060
Hey.

1471
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:36,060
Hey.

1472
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:39,060
You look like a fool.

1473
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,060
Do you know?

1474
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,060
I'm not going to give you a call.

1475
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:50,060
I'm going to talk to you.

1476
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:06,060
I was worried because I didn't have a call.

1477
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:08,060
I was worried because I didn't have a call.

1478
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,060
I was worried because I didn't have a call.

1479
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:13,060
I was worried because I didn't have a call.

1480
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,060
Are you a rookie?

1481
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,060
Are you a good girl?

1482
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:21,060
Teacher.

1483
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:24,060
Do you know who you are?

1484
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:26,060
Hey.

1485
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,060
I'm a teacher.

1486
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:31,060
I'm a little awkward.

1487
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:35,060
But I'm not going to be a kid anymore.

1488
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:39,060
You don't have to work.

1489
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:43,060
I thought of you from a long time ago.

1490
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:47,060
I can't do anything about my income.

1491
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:49,060
Are you going to the end?

1492
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:52,060
I'm going to the gym.

1493
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:55,060
I'll tell you.

1494
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:02,060
Here.

1495
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:10,060
But teacher.

1496
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:15,060
Is there a big problem for you?

1497
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:18,060
Is there a problem for you?

1498
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:21,060
Is there a problem for you?

1499
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:26,060
I like you.

1500
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,160
Done!

1501
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,320
You're getting on the nerves...

1502
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,500
Oh, they're too good.

1503
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,440
Yeah, Mr. Park.

1504
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,120
My house...

1505
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,740
is too good.

1506
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,560
So happy.

1507
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,340
It's as if you really aren't happy.

1508
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,060
I'm sorry.

1509
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:40,060
Are you going to the ground?
