00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,900
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,100
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,080
   

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,920
   

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,580
   
   

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,750
   
    
 Take off you coat.

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,760
   
   

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,190
What's wrong?

26
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,020
Where is my lighter?

27
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,900
I'll look for it. Please wait a moment.

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,530
Take the treatment. I'll find it for you.

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,520
Excuse me. Have you seen a small golden lighter?

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Lighter? No.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,080
This is my phone number. Call me if you see the lighter.

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,470
- Okay. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Not at all.

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,980
I can't find it.

34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,070
But I told them to call me if they find it.

35
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,060
Let's go.

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,910
I'll try again. Perhaps I can find it.

37
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,290
Never mind. Let's go.

38
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,690
Hello.

39
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,250
You found it?

40
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,620
What are you doing?

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,540
It's not your fault.

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,110
Sorry.

43
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,240
I shouldn't have selected volleyball class for you on my own.

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,020
I just wanted you to do more exercise.

45
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,680
You didn't expect for it to almost kill me.

46
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,580
Ask what you want.

47
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,130
Does this lighter mean a lot to you?

48
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,170
Yes.

49
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,300
You don't smoke, but you always take it with you.

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,000
Who gave it to you?

51
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,840
My dad left it.

52
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,740
He died in a car accident

53
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,030
when I was very young.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,670
When I was in high school,

55
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,760
we were going to sell our house

56
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,320
and I found it under my wardrobe.

57
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,850
My mom said, my dad was a truck driver.

58
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,380
He was a heavy smoker.

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,770
When I was just born,

60
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,090
he asked my mom to hide the lighter somewhere he couldn't find it,

61
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,000
so he wouldn't smoke at home when he wanted.

62
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,510
Later to make more money, he engaged in long-distance transport.

63
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,710
However, he was killed on site...

64
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,520
in a car accident.

65
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,470
That's why I always take it with me.

66
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,060
I think it is god's arrangement that my dad left the lighter to me,

67
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,670
like an agreement between us.

68
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,700
Now that he is gone, I should take care of my mom and sister for him.

69
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,640
But I failed.

70
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,330
My mom is gone.

71
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,150
My sister married a bastard,

72
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,880
leading a miserable life.

73
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,500
Sorry.

74
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,080
It's old.

75
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,810
Perhaps...

76
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,300
my dad wants to smoke.

77
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,910
It caught a virus?

78
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,010
This is the game?

79
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,640
What is this?

80
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,310
Exercises for Fundamental Principles of Marxism?

81
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,810
C.

82
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,320
   
   

83
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,400
   

84
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,680
 Game over. 

85
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,710
Don't be so brutal. You designed this?

86
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,270
If you fail the exam, don't shift the blame on the base.

87
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,750
The question bank is here.

88
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,190
You designed it for me?

89
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,520
I just did it for practice. I can design a dozen of such things.

90
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,940
Get over yourself.

91
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,080
The game ended as soon as it began.

92
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,320
How did you enter our university?

93
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,610
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

94
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,490
You stayed up late again?

95
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,350
   
   

96
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,230
There is still more to the recipe?

97
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,570
Yes.

98
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,540
I added it last night.

99
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,710
I think sometimes a compulsory recommendation of products will have a negative effect.

100
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,680
So I added a function of introducing diet therapy to make our software look more friendly.

101
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,900
Even if they don't buy at ordinary times, they can also come and have a look.

102
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,180
I think it's a way to keep customers.

103
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,690
Pretty good.

104
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,740
Say it.

105
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,350
Did you do it all by yourself?

106
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,630
Can you do it?

107
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,140
Blue Crown will check the finished product next Friday.

108
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,480
We can't make money until we pass it.

109
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,470
Look at the schedule and new arrangements.

110
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,060
   

111
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,100
I also need to solve the problem of high concurrency?

112
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,440
I've almost finished it. You optimize it again.

113
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,340
How long will it take? Is this necessary?

114
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,190
You piled so many codes. How many users can it withstand?

115
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,310
It will collapse if a large number of users log in.

116
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,060
Blue Crown doesn't have many users.

117
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,310
If you just kept such an idea of a few users, you wouldn't think it would explode.

118
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,710
We don't focus on the future.

119
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,160
According to our current design,

120
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,110
the program won't crash until 200,000 users simultaneously access the server.

121
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,000
Considering the current popularity of Blue Crown, how can he find 200,000 users?

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,560
I don't think we should waste too much effort on it.

123
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,230
Old Gao,

124
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,710
just listen to me.

125
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,050
From the beginning to the present of this project, I always listen to you.

126
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,610
You've suffered when you didn't listen to me.

127
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,820
Don't talk about the past.

128
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,580
Li Xun, I know this is your project.

129
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,790
I don't have a say in it.

130
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,460
But I don't want to waste my effort, my time, and energy.

131
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,160
Whatever.

132
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,340
Enough. Can you two stop for a while?

133
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,820
Li Xun, you don't have to take tests, but others have to take them.

134
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,460
Old Gao, go back and review first.

135
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,420
I'll help you finish it.

136
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,000
Li Xun, I will complete my task.

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,130
But that doesn't mean I agree with you.

138
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,180
Review your knowledge.

139
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,840
Eat this.

140
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,860
You're not used to not having a lighter?

141
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,610
I'll get used to it.

142
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,060
Give me the lighter later. I'll study it.

143
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,260
- Don't be silly. 
 - What if I can fix it?

144
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
You have a good appetite.

145
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,070
You use your brain so much every day.

146
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,060
Why are you not hungry?

147
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,990
With high efficiency and low energy consumption, your structure is against nature.

148
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,800
Can you behave like a lady?

149
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
Swallow your food before you talk.

150
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,820
You're a manic. And you even say I'm uncivilized.

151
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,740
You've become more and more daring lately.

152
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,140
When will you go home?

153
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,710
I would finish the exam first. Maybe a few days later.

154
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,860
How about I go with you?

155
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,660
- To where? 
 - Go to hand in the application to Blue Crown.

156
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,320
No need.

157
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,360
After the exam, everyone will go back home.

158
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,910
The time for handover is tight.

159
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,410
You can't handle it alone.

160
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,030
It takes me only three hours to go home. I'm not in a hurry.

161
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,010
More people, more power.

162
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,500
What power? The power of carrying bags?

163
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,100
We are a team. You can't just focus on lightening yourself.

164
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,030
You should pay attention to team building.

165
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,600
For instance, you have to allocate the work between me and Gao, especially Gao.

166
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,440
You have to let him show his ability.

167
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,880
Don't let morale drop.

168
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,310
The team will be good as long as everyone is good.

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,960
Zhu Yun,

170
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,700
I find you really have an ability.

171
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,760
What?

172
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,990
To advocate equalitarianism.

173
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,580
How about this?

174
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,390
I will call you Political Commissar Zhu.

175
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,640
I don't mind.

176
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,580
What am I responsible for?

177
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,250
Team building.

178
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,100
Make it specific.

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,200
Specifically, you're responsible for worrying

180
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,550
and I'm responsible for getting everything done.

181
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,250
Understand?

182
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,590
Yeah.

183
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,140
Then, what do I need to worry about?

184
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,060
First, worry about your Fundamental Principles of Marxism exam.

185
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,760
Deal. I'll stay with you after the exam.

186
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,400
♫  I really want to be with you  ♫

187
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,960
Whatever.

188
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,340
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

189
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,620
♫  The knight and princess are destined to meet  ♫

190
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,720
♫  Let me feel and guard your simple wish  ♫

191
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,550
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

192
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,600
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

193
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,820
Gao.

194
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,770
♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

195
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,700
♫  You say every good night  ♫

196
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,060
♫  Happiness has never changed  ♫

197
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,190
Finally, the exam is over.

198
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,120
What do you want to eat today?

199
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,670
Team Leader Li said that it was his treat.

200
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,400
The base has business though it opened less than half a year ago.

201
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,090
At the end of the year, will Group Leader Li give us some encouragement?

202
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,790
He said that if the Blue Crown project is successfully passed,

203
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,720
everyone will have red envelopes for the Spring Festival.

204
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,710
Today is team building.

205
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,600
- Do you want it or not? 
 - Political Commissar Zhu is reliable.

206
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,350
I finally figured it out.

207
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,430
Li Xun listens to you.

208
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,610
Let's go.

209
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,590
 What to eat? 

210
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,710
I'm going home for the Spring Festival.

211
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,410
Go shopping with me tomorrow.

212
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,240
I have plans for tomorrow.

213
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,720
You are out of the organization.

214
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
What are your arrangements?

215
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,340
I'm going to repair Li Xun's lighter tomorrow.

216
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,240
I knew it.

217
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,470
It still has something to do with Team Leader Li.

218
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,600
For him, you can get up earlier than chickens and sleep later than dogs.

219
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,760
You can do everything without complaint.

220
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,400
We are women, can you stop pleasing him?

221
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,870
Don't talk nonsense.

222
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,300
I broke his lighter. I have to fix it for him.

223
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,340
His lighter is quite old.

224
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,570
You can buy him a new one.

225
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,900
No. His lighter means something different to him.

226
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,400
I have to look for accessories or find one with the same principle.

227
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,660
I need to know how to assemble it.

228
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,300
Zhu Yun, Political Commissar, this base is really something.

229
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,400
You two are like opening a husband-and-wife shop.

230
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,000
 I have come back. I'm holding a painting exhibition in Shanghai. 

231
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,310
Brother Xiuzhu?

232
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,820
The holiday is coming.

233
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,380
Do you want to stay and work?

234
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,560
The application is going online.

235
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,000
Let's make a final effort to share our joys and sorrows.

236
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,940
My cousin will get married on Friday.

237
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,390
Wasn't your cousin just married?

238
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,550
Another one.

239
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,770
Why are you afraid of being late? They don't need you to play the suona.

240
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,380
I bought the ticket.

241
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,010
What about you?

242
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,050
I'm not a member of the base, okay?

243
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,650
Does it matter to me?

244
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,770
Then, why didn't you say this when having dinner with us?

245
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,680
How about you, Old Gao?

246
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,000
I've decided to quit the base.

247
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,870
Is this a joke?

248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,660
Is it funny?

249
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,250
Why?

250
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,400
No why.

251
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,140
I plan to take part in the competition next semester.

252
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,550
I have no energy.

253
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,100
In addition, God Li is great.

254
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,600
Without any burden from me, he may become more efficient.

255
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,900
I knew you'd come.

256
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,770
Old Gao, you really want to leave the base?

257
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,220
Am I so sensitive?

258
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,100
We've talked about this over and over again.

259
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,220
Every time I get angry and want to leave, you come to persuade me.

260
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,020
You are really Li Xun's great political commissar.

261
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,810
I dare not persuade you now.

262
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,330
Zhu Yun, you know what?

263
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,830
I've been first since I was young.

264
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,610
I had good academic performance and I was a member of the basketball and football school teams.

265
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,410
Every year before, I would bring many award certificates home.

266
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,660
They were worthless to me before.

267
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,600
Until I came to college and met Li Xun,

268
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,400
I then fully became a tool person that sets off his aura.

269
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,160
As long as I'm by his side, no one can see me.

270
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,090
But I don't mind at all.

271
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,700
I'm convinced. He's great.

272
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,150
I want to learn from him.

273
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Last time, I decided to quit the base.

274
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,120
It was the only time Li Xun came to me.

275
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,100
He was standing on the roof and said…

276
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,600
 Gao Jianhong, do you want to do something... 

277
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,480
 that really belongs to you? 

278
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,440
I do.

279
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,190
I really want to. I dream about it.

280
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,240
Compared to this, self-respect means nothing for me.

281
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:14,080
But until this time, Li Xun gave the software to Zhang Xiaobei because of you.

282
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I just found out that that stuff doesn't belong to me.

283
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,900
It belongs to Li Xun.

284
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,600
Zhu Yun,

285
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,000
I want to do something that really belongs to me.

286
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,810
Can you understand?

287
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,190
I know.

288
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,060
But I still want to apologize to you.

289
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,780
We are a team.

290
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,100
As for that app matter, Li Xun and I didn't consider your feelings.

291
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,370
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,780
No need. We are good friends.

293
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,520
We should help each other.

294
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,100
But since that time, I decided to leave the base once the Blue Crown's project is finished.

295
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,500
I didn't expect this moment would really come.

296
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,730
I feel relieved instead.

297
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,730
At least when I do a project later, my name Gao Jianhong will be written in the first place.

298
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,110
The first place.

299
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,670
Come on. Pass the ball.

300
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,180
Is it all done?

301
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,650
Is there something missing on your page?

302
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,210
You didn't place the logo on it?

303
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,780
Where are the cut pictures? I'll lead them in.

304
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,770
Tell me where the pictures are?

305
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,120
Those two from the Animation Academy didn't give them to me.

306
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,490
It's not too late to do it now.

307
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,660
I'll make whatever style you want.

308
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,630
Forget it.

309
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,920
Then you do it.

310
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,020
Can I do it?

311
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,720
How about I call Senior again?

312
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,650
It's too late.

313
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,580
There will be a way in a few days.

314
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,940
Why did you turn it off?

315
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,350
Let's go.

316
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,710
Where are you going?

317
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,380
My childhood friend is holding a painting exhibition here. He invited me.

318
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,260
Let's go to find inspiration by the way.

319
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,070
No.

320
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,400
Then go for a walk. What if we can come up with a way?

321
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,960
My friend is great.

322
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,860
The last paper I translated for Liu Sisi was about his painting.

323
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,570
I'm occupied.

324
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,430
Then let's go tomorrow.

325
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,700
 - Hello.  
 - Hello?

326
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,140
 Let's go. 

327
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,920
Li Xun? Go where?

328
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,330
The art gallery.

329
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,620
For what?

330
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,570
See you at the school gate in half an hour.

331
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,340
Really?

332
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,830
Did you climb here?

333
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,970
You dressed up?

334
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,980
You dress like this to see your friend's painting exhibition?

335
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,650
It's my childhood friend's painting exhibition, but why are you dressed up like this?

336
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,110
It seems that your friend is not important to you.

337
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,110
Your Highness, you are sensitive to the cold.

338
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,560
Would you like to take a carriage?

339
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,610
Wait for me. I'll get changed.

340
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,380
Come back. Come back. Go.

341
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,070
You said you couldn't go yesterday.

342
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,650
Can you wait for me?

343
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,240
- No. 
 - You'll die if you wait for me? 
 - Yes.

344
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,990
Hurry up.

345
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,020
   

346
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,420
Can you make way?

347
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,010
Wrong direction.

348
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,160
I told you to get out of the way, not to leave.

349
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,690
You told me to get out of the way. Why am I still standing next to you?

350
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,750
You need me to see you.

351
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,940
- Where to go? 
 - Hall No.2.

352
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,690
Can you stop the surprise attack next time?

353
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,100
You should at least make a phone call so I can get prepared to go with you.

354
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,120
This is a date anyway.

355
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,300
Princess always keeps words in her heart.

356
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,010
Why are you nervous today?

357
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,050
What are these paintings about? I can't understand.

358
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,150
Too unfriendly to us.

359
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,560
This is the Museum of Modern Art.

360
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,150
 Only you know? 

361
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,180
Our fate must be incompatible.

362
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,110
It's not good to be superstitious.

363
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,530
This is it.

364
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,350
- What are you doing? 
 - I'll take a photo for Brother Xiuzhu. Make way.

365
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,220
- This was created by your friend? 
 - Yes.

366
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,740
Then you can't take a photo of it.

367
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,390
This is a carbon painting. Taking pictures is not good for it.

368
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,090
Then I won't turn on the flash.

369
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,570
Not even that.

370
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
   

371
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,690
"Lin Xun (jagged)"?

372
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,120
Xun.

373
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,070
So coincidental?

374
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,410
You like this kind of painting?

375
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,050
It's good. It's really great.

376
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,170
What's great?

377
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you understand?

378
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,890
Somewhat abstract. Somewhat weird.

379
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,290
There is still some strength.

380
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,520
Where can you tell?

381
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,690
You asked me to do homework for Liu Sisi.

382
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,520
I just studied his paintings for a while.

383
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,350
But I've known him since childhood.

384
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,340
I used to play with him when I was young.

385
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,220
I didn't think he was so powerful.

386
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,000
Later, he went to study in France.

387
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,560
He went home for the Spring Festival and held an exhibition.

388
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,750
He's not that much older than us.

389
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,240
It's totally different from you.

390
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,660
What kind of man is he?

391
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,390
The media said he was a talented painter.

392
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,200
Who isn't a genius? I was the No.1 in the college entrance examination.

393
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,420
But the college entrance examination is a watershed.

394
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,710
From the moment it ends,

395
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,390
there are fewer and fewer things that people can do well with just hard work.

396
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,780
You want to die?

397
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,150
- Do you want to die?  
 - Do you remember this sentence?

398
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,970
Do you want to die? Do you want to die?

399
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,540
- Who said this truth? 
 - Do you want to die?

400
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,740
You come back. Come back. Come on.

401
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,870
Come on! Don't you like it?

402
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,050
- Come on. Enjoy it. 
 - No.

403
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,570
Keep enjoying it.

404
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,860
Come on, come on.

405
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,720
Look. Come back.

406
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Keep looking at it. Come and see.

407
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,550
Come closer. Come closer. Come on.

408
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,690
- What should I look at? 
 - Look at it earnestly.

409
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,750
"Lin Xun (jagged)".

410
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,150
- Look at it carefully. Come on. 
 - "Lin Xun (jagged)".

411
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,400
You get inside.

412
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,930
I'll tell you when the taxi comes.

413
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,260
- And what about you? 
 - I'm waiting for a taxi here.

414
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,580
I'm wearing thicker clothes than you.

415
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,080
Be good. Just go.

416
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,990
Go.

417
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,620
   

418
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,180
That's the price of wearing so little.

419
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,180
♫  Slowly missing you during the long night  ♫

420
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,560
♫  A moment of a fast beating heart  ♫

421
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,140
♫  As long as you're by my side  ♫

422
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,680
♫  I forgot time unconsciously  ♫

423
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,890
Why are you back?

424
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,590
Let's wait together.

425
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,060
Are you sure?

426
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,820
♫  Without you, even joy feels lonely  ♫

427
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,240
♫  Looking at your white shirt  ♫

428
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,320
♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

429
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,340
♫  The secret I've been hiding  ♫

430
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,310
♫  I really want to be with you  ♫

431
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,780
Okay! Stop, stop, stop.

432
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,040
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

433
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520
Go, go, go.

434
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,800
Wait a minute!

435
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,860
Why are you running so fast?

436
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,880
It's cold.

437
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,280
You wore so little.

438
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,420
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

439
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,790
Go, go, go.

440
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,220
Wait for me!

441
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,300
♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

442
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,200
♫  You say every good night  ♫

443
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,940
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

444
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,360
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

445
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,460
♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

446
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,300
♫  You say every good night  ♫

447
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,840
♫  Love circulates  ♫

448
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,100
Take three pills.

449
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,080
- What are you doing? 
 - It won't kill me.

450
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,620
Take more pills for the first time when you get a cold.

451
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,030
You don't understand this common sense?

452
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,160
Which planet has such common sense?

453
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,390
I've checked the water temperature.

454
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,340
Aren't you responsible for getting everything done?

455
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,950
Boss Li, you fall down so fast?

456
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,420
Shut up.

457
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,350
The price for dressing up.

458
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,560
You even laughed at my thick clothes.

459
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,140
 Even pretend to be strong. 

460
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,630
 Let me see who takes care of you during the Spring Festival. 

461
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,310
Hello. Yun'er.

462
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,640
Hello, Mom.

463
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,620
 Have you finished the exam? 

464
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,970
Yeah.

465
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:42,150
Xiuzhu has returned home, you know?

466
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,850
I know.

467
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,640
 Then come home early if you have nothing to do. 

468
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,100
 You haven't seen each other in years. 

469
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,080
 You can ask him things about studying abroad by the way. 

470
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,430
Well, Mom, I have something else to do at my school.

471
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,780
I want to stay two more days.

472
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,380
What's up?

473
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,480
It's Fang Shumiao.

474
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,200
She is our monitor and the student union has assigned some tasks to her. I need help her.

475
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,590
- Am I right, Fang Shumiao? 
 - Yes.

476
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,880
Mom, that's it.

477
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,280
Isn't the school out? What else to do?

478
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,000
Well, there are (Communist) Party classes during the winter vacation. I have to help.

479
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,010
Helping organize the Party classes is a good thing.

480
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,850
 It can pave the way for becoming a regular member in the future. 

481
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,140
When will you finish?

482
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,390
Weekend at most.

483
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,930
I'll get everything done after the weekend.

484
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,320
There are still several days left.

485
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,800
Anyway, after you get things done, just go home.

486
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,120
Don't wander around the school.

487
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,420
Then I may stay two more days.

488
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,900
Anyway, Xiuzhu's painting exhibition is held in Shanghai.

489
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,990
I'll go back after I see it.

490
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,200
Done.

491
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,660
You'll just go home a few days later.

492
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,050
So happy?

493
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,710
I never lied since I was a kid.

494
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,420
Every time I lied, my mom would catch me.

495
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,940
I don't think I know how to tell a lie.

496
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,410
Then tell your mom the truth.

497
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,260
Working more days at the base is not a bad thing.

498
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,820
She hates the base.

499
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,560
How dare I tell her?

500
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,980
Oh, I see.

501
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,670
Your mom is afraid that you will be in love with someone.

502
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,900
Have pity on your mom.

503
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,660
What she is afraid of has come true.

504
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,880
Fang Shumiao, you are really talking nonsense.

505
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,840
Zhu Yun! I just packed it!

506
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,450
It's 15 minutes.

507
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,030
You drive to school tomorrow and get Yun'er back.

508
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,350
What are you up to?

509
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,140
Didn't you just say she'd be back two days later.

510
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,550
The more I think about it, the more I feel wrong.

511
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,410
She's never been away so long.

512
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,980
But now she is hesitating to come back.

513
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,940
I'm worried that it may be because of that boy at the base.

514
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,020
You've thought too much.

515
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,830
Not at all.

516
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,390
She also said that she would go to attend Xiuzhu's painting exhibition in two days.

517
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,150
The exhibition is over today.

518
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,280
Xiuzhu is back.

519
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,010
Okay, I'll go.

520
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,820
It's my turn.

521
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,980
What do you want?

522
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,750
It's not good to warm yourself too much.

523
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,800
Comfortable.

524
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,530
You slept right here last night?

525
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,970
Eat while the food is still warm.

526
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,500
I have finished the picture. Take a look.

527
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,370
Redo it.

528
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,270
Hard color and ugly composition.

529
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,960
You saw the painting exhibition in vain.

530
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,670
You found no inspiration but just focused on having fun?

531
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,320
Can you be a quiet patient?

532
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,040
What matters is a good performance, not the picture.

533
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,740
You talk about performance every day.

534
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,450
Can't you make it more beautiful?

535
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,650
Do it yourself if you don't like it.

536
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,970
Okay, post it.

537
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,130
You talk big.

538
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,460
Can you do it?

539
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,840
Is it serious again?

540
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,420
Why don't we go to the hospital?

541
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,230
Mind your business.

542
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,770
Don't worry.

543
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,590
Li Xun, when are you going home?

544
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,320
I'm not going back.

545
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,170
You won't go home for the Spring Festival? Will Sister Li Lan come here?

546
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,420
Why do you have so many questions?

547
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,500
I'll be back in a minute.

548
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,950
Where are you going?

549
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,370
Buy medicine for you.

550
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,290
- No need. 
 - You have to have it.

551
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,780
What if you can't speak or open your mouth to Blue Crown by then, what will you do?

552
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,520
You're with me.

553
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,490
Wait. I'll be right back.

554
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,630
   

555
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,030
Mom.

556
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,940
 Yun'er. 

557
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,380
Have you finished your school work?

558
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,810
It will be over in two days.

559
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,820
You've seen the art exhibition.

560
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,470
I haven't had time…

561
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,040
It doesn't matter.

562
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,340
Tonight, Aunt Jiang and Xiuzhu will come to our house to have dinner.

563
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,880
Tonight?

564
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,040
Really tonight?

565
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,650
Yes, tonight.

566
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,380
Your Aunt Jiang said she hasn't seen you for years.

567
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,720
She misses you!

568
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,170
Let's make it tomorrow. It must be too late today.

569
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,920
I didn't buy any tickets yet.

570
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,780
I must be home by tomorrow evening.

571
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,660
Just today.

572
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,970
Your dad just went to have a meeting near your school.

573
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,950
After the meeting, he will drive you back.

574
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,430
 Pack your bag. 

575
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,400
 He should be there soon. 

576
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,230
- Uncle. 
 - Thank you.

577
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,200
You are sick?

578
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,000
Don't worry. I just have a cold.

579
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,840
Zhu Yun will be back soon.

580
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,860
Your base is very good.

581
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,510
Pretty good.

582
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,810
It's supposed to be a holiday.

583
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,000
No one except you is here?

584
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
You're even sick.

585
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,670
It's hard for you.

586
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,220
It's not a problem.

587
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,090
The project won't stop waiting for me to celebrate the Spring Festival.

588
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,490
Yeah.

589
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,260
Li Xun, there's something urgent at home.

590
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,180
Yun Yun.

591
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,240
Dad, you came here so soon?

592
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,520
I was anxious to go home.

593
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,600
So I came here early.

594
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,750
Well, you have to go back to the dormitory later to pack your stuff. Right?

595
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,850
How about this?

596
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,620
I'll drive over there. Then you don't have to carry your luggage.

597
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,260
Okay.

598
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,940
Uncle.

599
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,340
Drink more water.

600
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,200
- Bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

601
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,140
There's something urgent at home. I have to go back.

602
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,540
Okay.

603
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,540
Anyway, there's nothing else to do.

604
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,530
Go home for the Spring Festival.

605
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,250
I didn't help you. I'm sorry.

606
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,170
Not really.

607
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,950
Your ugly picture can be used.

608
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,380
Bye, then.

609
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,380
Take this medicine according to the instructions. Don't eat indiscriminately.

610
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,480
Let me know as soon as there is any news from Blue Crown.

611
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,840
Then I'm leaving.

612
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,700
Li Xun, you can do it.

613
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,260
Zhu Yun.

614
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,990
Tell me when you get home.

615
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,420
Okay.

616
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:05,050


617
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,740
   

618
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,180
 Li Xun, was that you? 

619
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,860
 How do you know where my house is? 

620
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,270
 I have been there before. 

621
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,740
 Then wait for me. 

622
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,840
 Why are you standing there? 

623
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,020
 - Come and take a seat. 
 - This is a single bed. 

624
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,720
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

625
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,540
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

626
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,600
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

627
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:45,300
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

628
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,020
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

629
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,400
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

630
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:02,440
♫  We will not separate  ♫

631
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,560
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

632
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,000
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

633
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,040
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

634
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:22,500
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

635
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,780
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

636
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,340
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

637
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,440
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

638
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,020
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

639
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,580
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

640
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,140
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

641
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,520
♫  That hot firework  ♫

642
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:06,920
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

643
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:23,080
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

644

648
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,100

00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:58,580
