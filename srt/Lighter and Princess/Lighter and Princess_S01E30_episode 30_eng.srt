00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:15,990


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,420
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,660
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,000
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,620
   

22
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,700
You came so early today.

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,840
The atmosphere of this company is rising every day.

24
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,860
Hello, Mr. Dong.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,050
You're late.

26
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,710
- According to the rules of our company, you should be fined 200 yuan. 
 - I...

27
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,150
Buy lunch for us at noon.

28
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,310
Well, forgive me...

29
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,410
Shut up!

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,700
I...

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
I'll declare something.

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,850
Li Xun, tell them about it.

33
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,690
Everyone, our company will develop a new project, called "Blind Box of Love".

34
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,140
The project is officially being launched today.

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,810
I'll take charge of it.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,460
   

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,630
   

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,670
I want to make a comment about your plan.

39
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,490
Are you making an imperial decree? Why did you have it printed on one side?

40
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,580
The other side of the paper is wasted.

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,150
It's hard for Mr. Dong to earn money. He even sold his car.

42
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,740
 Shut up! 

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,860
So noisy.

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,560
When did you start this project?

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
Some time ago.

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,670
You've done a really good job with this plan.

47
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,690
even they, novices, can understand it immediately.

48
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,260
It has a perfect work flow chart.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,630
Does our company still have money to develop a new game?

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,920
Mr. Dong sold his car for hundreds of thousands of yuan. It's not enough.

51
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,180
Li Xun is the investor in this game.

52
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,280
Now he's the biggest shareholder of our company.

53
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,150
But you guys are still under my leadership.

54
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,910
Necessary.

55
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,040
Li Xun, say something.

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,260
Just look at the pictures and text.

57
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,640
   

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,850
   

59
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,230
Look. The magnified version looks interesting.

60
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,880
   
   

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,020
   

62
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,460
   

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,940
 It turns out he went to the coffee shop to collect materials. 

64
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,580
   

65
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,460
This kind of game is a love role-playing

66
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,020
or nurturing simulation game on the market.

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,100
However, the previous games were usually oriented toward the female market.

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,560
There're few such games oriented towards us unmarried and lonely groups.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,920
I think it's a good idea.

70
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,700
Is it a good idea?

71
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,160
What are they actually about?

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,580
The title is on the first page of the plan.

73
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,900
Surely I know it. I ask you about its content.

74
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,270
It looks like an ordinary love game,

75
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,530
but the difference lies in its title.

76
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,430
Blind box?

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,080
Do you know Skinner box?

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,170
I know thirteen spices.

79
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,210
Have you heard of hero cards?

80
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,650
I can find them in the crispy instant noodles.

81
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,880
An item that has gradually increased in second-hand transactions in recent months is called the blind box.

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,990
Lots of people would rather spend money on figurines that they may not like,

83
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,870
so that they get chances to get hidden top-selling items.

84
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,880
This is the psychological basis of the blind box.

85
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,920
In our game, players don't choose their favorite love partners themselves

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,960
but do it by opening the blind boxes.

87
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,500
It's like choosing dancing partners when the lights are out.

88
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,250
Only after completing the game tasks and overall story lines, can they choose again.

89
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,340
But if we want every player to interact with stories of other love types in a single game line,

90
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,720
- and we can't change... 
 - I see.

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,630
It's an intentional design.

92
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,200
Yes, it is.

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,370
They open new chapters constantly in order to find their favorite love partners.

94
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,790
That is to say, they'll constantly recharge in the game.

95
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,820
They'll pay more for the game.

96
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,680
That's right.

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,100
Yes. Yes.

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,200
Because every player will meet his favorite partner.

99
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,610
 Does a love game have so rich content? 

100
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,210
Mr. Dong, I think this game can become popular.

101
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,250
- Can it become popular? 
 - Yes, indeed.

102
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,310
If not, I'll change my surname to Zhang.

103
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,600
I don't care whether you change your surname to mine.

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,980
I only care when I can play it.

105
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,900
Yes, yes, yes.

106
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,300
Don't you think this game is dirty?

107
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
It isn't.

108
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,560
Is it dirty?

109
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,770
Look at these characters. Off-work beautiful teacher.

110
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,270
Strict female boss.

111
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,500
Literary girl in travel. Maid.

112
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,480
- Isn't it a dirty game? 
 - No, it isn't.

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,770
Yes. It's good.

114
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,550
Yes.

115
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,380
It's just a game. Don't combine it with reality.

116
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,590
This is the first art draft.

117
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,660
Don't be so sensitive.

118
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,910
This game will produce a large number of characters,

119
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,600
including changing plots...

120
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,400
but the core is to let everyone experience the thrill of entering the game after blind selection again and again.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,160
Has anyone developed such games?

122
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,500
No. If there were such games, their launch time wouldn't be earlier than ours.

123
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,690
Do you know why? Because they're easy to be reported.

124
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,360
Wrong.

125
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,250
It's because few people think of it.

126
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,860
Such games are reported only because those followers are investigated collectively

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,300
after they add low elements.

128
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,120
There's still a risk of being reported.

129
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,860
I'll control the game content strictly to avoid such a risk.

130
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,060
Then let's begin.

131
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,030
No, can you pursue it a little bit?

132
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,690
What are you creating?

133
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,210
You said you wanted to make money,

134
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,930
so you tried to design games that were at the leading edge of technology.

135
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,800
Now you change your way of picking up girls.

136
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,840
Let's vote.

137
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
Anyone who agrees with my plan can raise your hand.

138
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,900
I can't go on with this meeting.

139
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,880
Are you really angry?

140
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,230
Are you so happy to discuss this kind of topic?

141
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,740
Guo Xiaojian usually looks serious.

142
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,030
He just smiled like that.

143
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,750
Really?

144
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,420
It's just a love-nurturing simulation game without so many values.

145
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,220
Don't magnify and overanalyze it.

146
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,190
Go on with your meeting. I'll do my own work.

147
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,650
Don't be angry.

148
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll explain to you after the meeting.

149
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,650
Done.

150
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,840
- Haven't you left? 
 - Let's go.

151
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,100
You may leave first.

152
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,020
- Don't forget to turn off the lights if you're the last one to leave. 
 - Okay.

153
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,730
Fang, there's a spicy crayfish restaurant beside my home.

154
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,670
Let's go and have spicy crayfish.

155
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,740
 You said you would explain it to me. 

156
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,370
 Where are you? 

157
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,130
Come in.

158
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,020
I'll get something.

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,050
Go ahead.

160
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,320
Why do you blush?

161
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
Are you all right?

162
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
It's raining.

164
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,700
Yes. The rain came so suddenly.

165
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes, it came suddenly.

166
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
Let nature take its course.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
It's raining heavily.

168
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,900
Your tape.

169
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Are you going to defeat Gao Jianhong with this game?

170
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,100
Just this game.

171
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Li Xun, if you want to defeat him ultimately, you should at least think out an atomic bomb.

172
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,000
What are you doing now? A slingshot at best.

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Your work is really eye-opening.

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,600
This only shows that good works can stimulate human nature.

175
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,800
I don't care whether my plan is an atomic bomb, slingshot, or not.

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,300
None of that matters. I don't need to defeat him

177
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,900
but just make him full of fear of being defeated by me.

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,600
You've thought out a way to deal with him, right?

179
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
I'll tell you later.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,800
You're really looking more and more like you used to be.

181
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,300
Thank you.

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I won't help you with this project.

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,100
Don't have wishful thinking.

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,900
I just want to tell you this.

185
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,200
What?

186
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Go on with your previous project "Invincible General".

187
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,100
If our company wants to keep a foothold, we should not only make money

188
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,800
but also show our attitude through some games.

189
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
"Invincible General" is the signature game of our company.

190
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
You'll know later.

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,300
What do you mean by that?

192
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,500
I know what you worry about, and I'll settle everything for you.

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Got it?

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,300
 I want to say. 

195
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,900
 I know what you worry about, and I'll settle everything for you. 

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
 Got it? 

197
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,700
 Yes. 

198
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,200
Make time for the weekend.

199
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,000
For what?

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
You broke my bed,

201
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
so you should be responsible for it.

202
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
 Unlocked. 

203
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,200
According to your request, this is an apartment with two bedrooms and one living room.

204
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,900
So big.

205
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,200
You acted much faster than Fu Yizhuo.

206
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,000
How does he know how to find a house? I have rental experience.

207
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,900
How do you like it?

208
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I'll give you a card number. You should pay the rent every three months.

209
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,200
The apartment owner is abroad, so you can stay here with ease.

210
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
You can work in this room,

211
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,100
and rest in the other room.

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,700
Move away the table and put a bed in this room.

213
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,400
Are you going to sleep in this room?

214
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,700
Leave it to Hou Ning. He'll come back.

215
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,800
Let's go.

216
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,500
Where will we go?

217
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,600
Let me carry one for you. Okay?

218
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,800
Your back is so vulnerable.

219
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
Don't try to carry such heavy items. Okay?

220
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
Then let's carry them together.

221
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
What did you buy?

222
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,600
I bought a pot.

223
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,700
It's I who bought the pot.

224
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,200
Your shirt is creased.

225
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,300
I wear it when sleeping.

226
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,200
But you haven't washed it.

227
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
It's still clean.

228
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,300
I wore it.

229
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
So?

230
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,500
So...

231
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,800
So you should wash it.

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,900
So shy.

233
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,300
I got a message, but I'm not sure whether it's true.

234
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,000
What is it?

235
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijing are planning backdoor listing.

236
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
If they can't stand still, they have to run.

237
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
Are they courting death?

238
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,600
But if this is true, they are preparing to submit their materials.

239
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,900
So?

240
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,100
So if L &amp; P Company is really listed, we can't defeat Gao Jianhong anymore.

241
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Listen carefully.

242
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,500
If I can't prevent his company from being listed,

243
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,400
I'll change my surname and admit my defeat before him.

244
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Do you have a plan?

245
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
No.

246
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,100
You really don't or you don't want to say?

247
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Is there a difference?

248
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Take good care of your project.

249
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,800
Li Xun, I share everything with you. Right?

250
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,290
You don't need to tell me. I can guess it.

251
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,800
You are amazing that you can guess it.

252
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,600
But if I can't guess something, you should tell me.

253
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,500
What do you want to say?

254
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
We can't make the mistakes we made before.

255
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,200
No matter how you plan to deal with Gao Jianhong next,

256
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,600
you should consult with me before you make any decision.

257
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll tell you.

258
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,100
We should communicate with each other.

259
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,800
 Li Xun, you're not alone now. 

260
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
 We need to talk with each other. 

261
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,400
 Understood. 

262
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
I actually said the same words as I had said four years ago.

263
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,100
Zhu Yun, you fool.

264
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Come on.

265
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,400
Jin Cheng, can I get your autograph?

266
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
I like you so much. I'm your fan.

267
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,700
Jin Cheng. Jin Cheng. Jin Cheng.

268
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,000
Could you leave your autograph here?

269
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
Thank you, Jin Cheng. Thank you, Jin Cheng.

270
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,500
- Don't be so impetuous next time. 
 - Thank you.

271
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,600
Jin Cheng, I love you forever.

272
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Love you. Jin Cheng, I love you forever. I saw him personally.

273
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
Jin Cheng, I love you.

274
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,000
I told Director Gao and he agreed to your participation next time.

275
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
I don't want to participate in these boring variety shows.

276
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,600
I already promised him.

277
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,400
Do you remember how long it's been since you properly wrote a song?

278
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,600
Write songs?

279
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Isn't that single I wrote last month good?

280
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,400
It's such an awful song.

281
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes.

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
There's no difference.

283
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
But my fans like it very much.

284
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,000
It ranks first in both sales and number of downloads.

285
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Isn't it good enough?

286
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't touch me.

287
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
Are you really mad at me?

288
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,500
I know the song sounds bad,

289
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,100
but our fans like it.

290
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,000
It's good as long as they're willing to pay for our albums.

291
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
Ren Di, times have changed.

292
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,700
Popular singers dominate the market.

293
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,300
We should write songs according to the needs of the fans.

294
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Everyone tries to make a quick buck,

295
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,200
so we don't have to act against the times.

296
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,900
Again. Don't touch me.

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,700
The trending search for our previous quarrel and breakup is still on the list.

298
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,400
You are always like this, what should we do if we are photographed again? Now we have to sit down.

299
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,800
Didn't you pay for it?

300
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,900
You've been trending topics in the whole month and even the whole year.

301
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,900
You're just the resident guest of trending topics.

302
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,300
This is a routine operation.

303
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,000
I didn't expect that our news would become a trending topic.

304
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Maybe people are interested in such topics.

305
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Listen.

306
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,500
I won't see Light Red becomes a band that attracts public attention through hype

307
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
and writes trash.

308
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
What do you mean?

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
You know my meaning well.

310
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Do you want to kick me out?

311
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,200
Listen.

312
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Without me, Light Red wouldn't have become so popular.

313
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,700
Light Red only belonged to you, so you could decide who stayed.

314
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,400
But it's different now. I'm the brand of Light Red now.

♫  Sad truth is uncovered in a trice  ♫

327
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,400

330
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,440
♫  The definitions of love and hate have been blurred  ♫

♫  And this love doesn't always move in a straight line  ♫

339
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,420
♫  But in the end  ♫

340
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,600
So popular. You've been the trending topic the whole day.

341
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,880
   

342
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,730
Do you feel it a pity if you withdraw from Light Red?

343
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,800
Legally speaking, the Light Red Band belongs to you.

344
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,140
Let me tell you something.

345
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,520
The car Jin Cheng drives is the second car he bought this year.

346
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,960
So he has a total of seven cars now, five of which are red.

347
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,280
He actually doesn't like red.

348
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,900
As our band became popular and our songs ranked top

349
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,580
in various lists when he bought the first car, so he thinks red is a lucky color.

350
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,470
As a result, fans think he likes red and has made red the representative color of our band.

351
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,210
They think he's a man as passionate as a flame.

352
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,510
After so many years, he also thinks that red is a good color.

353
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,310
I think he has forgotten what his favorite color is.

354
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,830
He has become confident after getting popular with fans.

355
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,540
Jin Cheng is no longer that unknown Liu, who scrubbed the toilet bowl.

356
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes. He has changed fast.

357
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,670
Nothing stays changeless, especially men.

358
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,060
Cheers.

359
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
What are you doing?

360
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,200
Do you want to become the trending topic again?

361
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,400
Lovelorn Ren Di.

362
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,130
Light Red Band Drummer Ren Di plays the drum to vent her mood in a bar.

363
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,300
Whatever. Will you join me?

364
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,590

 Hello. This way, please. 

373
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,240
 Mr. Li, look here. 

374
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,310
 Thank you. 

375
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,680
 This way, please. 

376
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,410
Mr. Gao, Luna, look here.

377
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,920
Luna, may I take a photo of you?

378
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,550
Mr. Fang, you L &amp; P Company are really the leader of our industry.

379
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,090
I'd appreciate your help. I'd appreciate your help.

380
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,240
Yes.

381
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,540
You're young and promising.

382
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,400
- Hello. 
 - Mr. Gao. Mr. Gao. 
 - Hello.

383
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,370
- Long time no see. 
 - Long time no see.

384
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,150
Long time no see.

385
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,280
Enjoy yourselves. Excuse me.

386
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,800
Okay.

387
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,830
I've figured out the information about that man you saw last time at the police station.

388
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,590
He is Hou Ning, a hacker.

389
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,660
He and Li Xun met in prison.

390
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,830
He was put into prison twice.

391
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,360
Last time, he was sentenced to seven years in prison

392
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,710
as he hacked into a listed network company and made a lot of money.

393
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,570
He could hack into a network company, showing his high ability.

394
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,230
He stayed with Li Xun after being released.

395
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,410
They had a huge fight and fell out after leaving the public security bureau last time.

396
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,620
Then he disappeared.

397
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,790
Have they fallen out?

398
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,600
He needs to be checked carefully in case this is a setup.

399
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,250
Don't worry.

400
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,100
He knows Li Xun best.

401
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,760
Find him.

402
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,720
How is it going with Li Xun's project?

403
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,270
Since you asked me about it, let me tell you something magical.

404
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,550
We worked on the tracking and dispatch system last week.

405
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,200
He drew me a task to follow.

406
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Then I completed it in a week.

407
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,500
I showed it to him today. Guess what he said.

408
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,610
Did he ask you to redo it?

409
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,210
No.

410
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,050
He had finished it.

411
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,350
I finished it day and night in a week, but he could finish it in half a day.

412
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,200
She's such an unusual talent.

413
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,890
You just stayed up late for one week and you couldn't stand it.

414
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,990
He has stayed up late for over 10 years.

415
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,180
If you stay up late for over 10 years, you'd do better and faster than him.

416
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,960
Stop kidding me.

417
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,200
Brother Xiuzhu.

418
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,730
Then I'll leave first.

419
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,100
Okay.

420
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,250
What brings you here?

421
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,810
You must have forgotten me.

422
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,590
We haven't seen each other for more than half a month, Miss Zhu.

423
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,180
I'm single-minded about my work.

424
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,860
You know it.

425
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,010
Li Xun! Li Xun! Go downstairs now.

426
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,980
What's up?

427
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,890
Stop asking me that. I'm here to report to you.

428
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:26,450
If another man wins the love of Zhu Yun, don't blame me for not reminding you.

429
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,310
What happened?

430
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,350
That handsome, unrestrained, young, and promising Painter Tian comes.

431
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,150
He's talking with Zhu Yun downstairs.

432
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,970
Did he come?

433
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,840
Do you mean Mr. Tian Xiuzhu?

434
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,490
It has nothing to do with you.

435
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,310
Calm down.

436
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,730
Zhu Yun doesn't like him.

437
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,660
Do I look good in this suit?

438
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, you look strange.

439
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,930
You're like Kung Fu Panda.

440
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,650
Can it show my temperament?

441
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,780
Well, what's the matter with you?

442
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,690
Won't you go?

443
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,700
If I knew you would ignore me after I helped you paint the posters, I would have done it slowly.

444
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,610
I'm too busy with my work.

445
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,550
I'll meet and have dinner with you this weekend. Okay?

446
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,650
I'd like to have foie gras, too.

447
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:33,520
Don't kid me. You're not free today?

448
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,250
I'm occupied today.

449
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm also busy today.

450
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,030
Mr. Tian. Mr. Tian, here you are!

451
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,890
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

452
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,020
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Then let's go upstairs.

453
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,520
Okay. Please go upstairs. Please go upstairs. Well, this way, please.

454
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,620
I'm going to work. Don't bother me.

455
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,050
Let's go.

456
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,710
- Mr. Tian. 
  - What happened? Why did they invite him? 

457
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,770
This way, please.

458
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,110
Please.

459
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,000
Our boss happened to go out today.

460
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,550
Let-Let me introduce you.

461
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,900
This is our project leader Li Xun.

462
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,640
We meet again.

463
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,740
Project Leader, you'd better stand up now.

464
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,730
Hello.

465
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,750
Come on. This way, please.

466
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,110
Come.

467
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,000
Come. This way, please.

468
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,790
Go to this room.

469
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,710
What will they talk about?

470
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,910
I'm more curious than you.

471
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,520
Did you invite Tian Xiuzhu?

472
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,210
Yes. Yes, I did.

473
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,640
Did you contact him privately?

474
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,980
You may think so.

475
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,550
How did you get his contact information?

476
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,350
I saw it from the plan Project Leader Li gave me.

477
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,620
There's an email address on the page for the art requirements.

478
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,260
Are you sure Project Leader Li asked you to invite him?

479
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,690
Yes, definitely.

480
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,820
What else did he say?

481
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,510
He also said...

482
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,040
He told Mr. Tian that our company has a heavy task.

483
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,710
The art style of our project hasn't been determined.

484
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,520
If it delays being determined, it'll cause extra costs

485
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,870
and overtime for all the staff, including you.

486
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,080
Go to have your meeting.

487
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,740
Then I'll go.

488
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,550
Drink less tea.

489
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,550
I got it.

490
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,970
Project Leader Li asked me to forward the second version of the poster painted by Tian Xiuzhu to him.

491
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,780
I thought he wanted to check the effect.

492
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,760
Oh, he actually played a deep game.

493
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,910
I wondered why he gave up the priceless art resources easily.

494
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,600
I think Mr. Tian came for the sake of you.

495
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,400
I also think so.

496
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,800
He was jealous last time, but has already forgotten about it.

497
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Awesome.

498
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
- Let me make a bet with you. 
 - What's the bet?

499
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,900
If Project Leader Li can't prosper our company within two years,

500
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,200
I'll dig out my own eyes and make wine for you guys.

501
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,000
No need.

502
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
 They've had a long meeting. 

503
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
 What are they actually talking about? 

504
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,200
 Why haven't they ended it? 

505
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,300
I think he is behaving normally.

506
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,200
Others may think they're close workmates.

507
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,700
I'm leaving.

508
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,300
Well, Mr. Tian.

509
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,800
Slowly.

510
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,900
You must have had a long day.

511
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,600
No, it's you who has had a long day.

512
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Yes. I've had a long day.

513
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,900
Let's go together. I'll have dinner with you.

514
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,400
You're occupied tonight, aren't you?

515
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,100
I asked for leave.

516
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

517
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,300
What did you say at the meeting today?

518
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,800
We discussed the art style of the game

519
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,400
and he asked me to design the images of several main characters.

520
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,600
Your game is really good.

521
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,800
It includes various scenes, characters, and settings of different times.

522
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,700
If players can experience all the story lines,

523
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,800
I guess they'll be deeply fond of it.

524
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,900
You're an artist. Do you also like such games?

525
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
I'm an artist.

526
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,800
but I'm not a monk.

527
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
If I play a blind box-style game,

528
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,100
I'd never know who will spend a journey with me.

529
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,300
Don't you like such an experience?

530
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,700
I don't like it, nor am I interested in it.

531
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,500
Thank you.

532
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,900
Do you really have time to do it?

533
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I promised him.

534
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,700
Even so, you can go back on your word as you didn't sign a contract.

535
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,000
Think it over, Zhu Yun.

536
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
What do you mean?

537
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,600
Your words are very important to me.

538
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,400
Perhaps I may go back on your word if you keep asking me not to help him.

539
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Of course, I hope that all the projects of our company are successes,

540
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,200
including the game "Blind Box of Love" I don't like.

541
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,500
But I really haven't reached the level of Li Xun.

542
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
What level?

543
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
I just don't want to bother you for some reason.

544
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,900
Zhu Yun, you should understand that

545
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,300
I'm not helping him but you.

546
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,800
I said I want you to succeed.

547
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,200
Besides, it's very simple for me.

548
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,600
The sooner you succeed, the sooner we can leave here.

549
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,700
I don't want you to keep staying here.

550
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,200
We had a very tense meeting today.

551
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,100
Did he make things difficult for you?

552
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,400
No.

553
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
He's a person...

554
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,500
who is very stubborn.

555
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,800
He just wants to vent his moods.

556
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,700
I don't want to evaluate his behaviors.

557
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,100
I just want to express my own opinions.

558
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I know he's very persistent.

559
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,000
but I didn't expect him to be so strict with himself.

560
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,000
I think he has a very serious health problem.

561
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,800
He just works by strong will.

562
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,600
What's wrong with him?

563
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
It's not particularly serious.

564
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,500
He lacks rest.

565
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,200
He's used to spending little time on rest.

566
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,000
Do you prefer this life?

567
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,800
In fact, we've spent as much time together as you and him,

568
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,200
but there aren't any exciting stories.

569
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,200
I prefer a stable life.

570
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,500
Because I think it's not easy to live a safe and healthy life.

571
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,100
I'm going to France for an exhibition at the end of next year.

572
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,300
I hope you can go with me.

573
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
- Brother Xiuzhu. 
 - Zhu Yun,

574
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,500
don't rush to answer me now.

575
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,800
We don't know what will happen in the future.

576
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,100
Help yourself.

577
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,200
Eat more.

578
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,800
Okay.

579
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,800
Have you thought it well?

580
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:16,720


581
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,300
   

582
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,100
 Zhu Yun, something big has happened. 

583
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,000
 The background system of our project Invincible General was hacked. 

584
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,200
 Do you know him? 

585
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,400
 You know him, too. 

586
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,500
 If you do something wrong, you will be punished. 

587
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,000
♫  You're over there with the fireworks  ♫

588
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,400
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

589
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,900
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,600
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

597
