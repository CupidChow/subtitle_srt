1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,100


2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,740
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,700
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,300
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,600
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,400
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,400
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,600
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,100
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,300
   

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,100
   

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,100
Later, he always did my homework for me to earn money.

23
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,000
He seemed to always be short of money in high school.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Later I learned that his mother was terminally ill.

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,300
 Stop. Stop. Stop. 

26
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,200
 How did you get hurt? 

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,500
 In PE class, he hit the basketball stand with a nail. 

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,800
 Doctor, will I suffer from tetanus? 

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
 Can I still dance? 

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,300
 I don't want to amputate it. 

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,200
 Don't worry. 

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,900
 You just need to get a tetanus shot. 

33
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,100
 Have a seat and wait for me here. 

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,200
 I'm going to pay for it. 

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
 Okay. 

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Li Xun. 

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
 Li Xun, you also got hurt? 

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,400
 Let me see. 

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
   

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Li Xun!

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,200
Li Xun, my leg is injured!

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
The doctor asked me to take a month off.

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,900
I entrust you with my homework!

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,300
I wanted to lend him money, but I knew he would refuse.

45
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,000
He had been superior for no reason from childhood,

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,100
so he suffered a lot.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
But he never changed.

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,500
After that, he lived by hacking,

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,600
but he never hacked others' computers.

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,200
He just took back stolen information for others.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,900
He was principled.

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,100
He said,

53
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,900
 Liu Xiang doesn't run fast to be a thief. 

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,400
He was so arrogant when he was young.

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,100
At 17, my dancing partner, who always cooperated with me left.

56
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,500
Even my teacher asked me to give up dancing.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
At that time, I felt my world was collapsing,

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
so I indulged myself.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,800
But Li Xun found me

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,800
and said some words.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
"Idiot,"

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
he said.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Do these two words need to be paved for such a long time? 

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
"Idiot," he said.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,900
 Idiot, it's a long way to victory or failure. 

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,400
 But we've just set out. 

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
He scolded me many times,

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,400
but I felt his sincerity only at that time.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Since then, I had imagined that we were biological brothers.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,500
So I started to call him by his given name and imagined that we had the same family name.

71
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,930
What do you think?

72
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,900
It's reasonable.

73
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,200
Do me a favor.

74
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,900
Receive it.

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,300
You're really very similar.

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,600
It has nothing to do with my father.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
This is my own money.

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,200
I know he's capable and can make money in many ways,

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,400
but everything costs money. Right?

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
He is a man who will do great things

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,600
but shouldn't be troubled by trifles.

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,200
I know he won't accept my father's money,

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,200
but he's really short of startup capital.

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,900
Given his temper, he won't ask anyone for help.

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,600
Do you agree?

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,648
Anyway, I can hardly live by dancing.

87
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,400
Just receive this as my investment.

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
I won't interfere in anything.

89
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,200
If you don't believe my words, we can draft a contract now.

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,800
Zhu Yun, I'll never hurt Li Xun.

91
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
Believe me.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I want to help you.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
You know him well.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
He is still superior for no reason.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He doesn't want to be controlled by anyone.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Only when making money by himself and having the final say can he be relieved.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't worry. I'll always accompany him.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,900
All his dreams will come true.

99
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
Okay.

100
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm leaving.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,500
Okay.

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,400
Zhu Yun, Li Xun is very capable, but he also has weaknesses.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,300
It may be related to his experience.

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,700
Sometimes he indeed goes to extremes, as if he is walking on a tightrope.

105
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,200
I know it.

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
He always refused others' help,

107
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
but now you appear.

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,100
Right?

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,900
University is the real beginning of his life.

110
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
He regards it as a new starting point.

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,700
I'll accompany him. It's also my new starting point.

112
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,100
Okay.

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,600
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,000
 Has the list of recommended students of your university been publicized? 

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,800
No. It seems that our university is always late for this.

116
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,200
 It's bad for students to make other choices. 

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
 If you're not recommended, 

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,900
and it's late for you to choose a good foreign university, you'll get nothing.

119
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,200
 Yeah. 

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,700
I'll call Miss Zhang to ask about it tomorrow.

121
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,200
It's useless to ask my class teacher about it because our school is in charge of this matter.

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,800
Your inquiry will be in vain. Fang Shumiao had asked about it yesterday.

123
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,700
 It's so unreliable. 

124
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
 Your school doesn't consider students at all. 

125
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah. If only everyone behaved like you.

126
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,400
 You're right. 

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Listen up, Yun Yun. Pay more attention to this.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Tell me as soon as you get the news. Then we can make a decision together.

129
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,300
I see.

130
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,500
Shumiao is back. Bye.

131
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,300
You're back.

132
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,430
Will you receive the postgraduate recommendation?

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,700
I haven't decided yet.

134
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,100
You're considering it, while others are even ineligible.

135
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,200
It's a waste of a place.

136
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,100
Shumiao, isn't your postgraduate comprehensive exam score enough?

137
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't be so straightforward.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,100
It's embarrassing.

139
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Actually, it's important to your future.

140
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,500
Facing graduation, we feel confused about everything,

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,700
as if we're standing at a foggy intersection.

142
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't be sentimental.

143
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,586
I am a living example.

144
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm not sentimental.

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
This is the first time I can really make a decision for myself.

146
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Hello.

147
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,000
 Hello, Lina, I just finished the IELTS. 

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
 - Are you free tonight?  
 - I'm leaving.

149
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,600
What did you say, Old Gao?

150
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
I asked you whether you're free tonight.

151
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,500
I want to invite you to dinner.

152
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
 Okay. I'm free. 

153
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
 Where would you like to go? 

154
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,400
The restaurant you took me to before.

155
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,800
8:00 tonight.

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
I'll wait for you.

157
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,700
Miss Xu.

158
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
- For me? 
 - Yes.

159
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,200
Mr. Gao is waiting for you inside.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Please.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
Thank you.

162
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,900
Lina,

163
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,100
today is the 900th day we've known each other.

164
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,600
I want to tell you something.

165
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,500
When I met you at the Information Technology University for the first time,

166
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,300
I thought I had never seen such a beautiful girl.

167
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,200
When you looked at me and talked to me,

168
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,700
I even felt too embarrassed to look up at you.

169
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Old Gao.

170
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,400
That night was the first time you brought me to this restaurant.

171
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
I knew nothing.

172
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,900
I couldn't even read the menu,

173
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,200
but you didn't laugh at me.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,200
That night, we talked about 5G and apps,

175
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,800
but I didn't care about how fast science and technology would develop back then.

176
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,300
I just hoped that I could accompany you

177
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,800
in the future.

178
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,300
You're pretty, cute,

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,300
gentle, and kind.

180
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,900
You're the best girl in the world.

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,900
Any adjective...

182
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,700
can't be your embodiment.

183
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,200
I know I'm not worthy of you,

184
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,900
but I'd like to work hard and try my best to approach you.

185
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
Lina,

186
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
will you give me a chance

187
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,900
of standing beside you?

188
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Old Gao, thank you very much.

189
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,000
I've heard a lot of confessions,

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,900
but no one was as sincere and passionate as you.

191
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,500
I was almost tempted for a moment just now.

192
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,000
Actually, like you,

193
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm also used to chasing those I can't get,

194
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,800
just like I chose programming when I just entered the university.

195
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,100
I don't even understand it now,

196
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,000
but I'll graduate soon.

197
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,100
I always think that if I had given up programming

198
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,600
and focused on folk dance,

199
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,700
maybe I'd have stood on the stage of the National Center for the Performing Arts.

200
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
But I can't help it, I just like it.

201
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,200
It's like I can't help myself...

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,400
and have to like someone who doesn't like me.

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,100
It's really tiring.

204
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,500
You must understand me.

205
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,900
Lina,

206
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I don't expect that you can promise me now,

207
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,000
but I hope I can accompany you.

208
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,800
But I don't want to fool you.

209
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,700
I can't ignore your sincerity.

210
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,300
I can wait.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,700
- I can wait for you. 
 - Why would you wait?

212
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,400
If I tell you, I won't give up Li Xun

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,400
as you do now, will you still wait for me?

214
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,700
But Li Xun and Zhu Yun have been together for three years.

215
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,300
Yeah.

216
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,000
I also hope I can be big-hearted.

217
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Old Gao, thank you very much for preparing these for me tonight.

218
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,600
This is the best gift I've ever received.

219
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,200
I believe you'll definitely have a girl who likes and admires you.

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
Li Xun.

221
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
Stop writing programs.

222
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,800
New Year's Eve will end soon.

223
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
Let's do something else.

224
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,100
Okay.

225
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
Let's do some exercises together.

226
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
It really tickles.

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,600
We're really exercising.

228
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Or else?

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,900
What else do you want?

230
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,800
Anyway, I don't want to do such a tiring and boring thing.

231
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,500
Is it boring to have a walk with me?

232
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
No.

233
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,200
Is it boring?

234
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sir, buy a rose.

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,900
Would you like it?

236
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,200
No.

237
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
But she has had a tiring night.

238
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,900
We have to support her business.

239
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
50 yuan.

240
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,700
So expensive?

241
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,500
I'll buy them all.

242
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,800
May you be happy.

243
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,900
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks, sir.

244
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,400
They're a little expensive. Don't do such a thing again.

245
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,600
At the start-up stage, you should value the ROI.

246
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,500
You also know that we won't get any return from these?

247
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,400
Well, flowers are different.

248
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,000
It can't be measured by money.

249
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,200
This is the first time I have received roses.

250
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Really?

251
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,100
You fool.

252
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,800
These are Chinese roses.

253
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't care. I think they're roses.

254
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,500
- Annoying. 
 - You're annoying.

255
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,000
- Who is the most annoying? 
 - You.

256
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,400
Li Xun, look.

257
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,000
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

264
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,900

274
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
Zhu Yun,

275
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,410
a name you're familiar with will be shown on a building here.

276
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,600
What do you mean?

277
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,900
L&amp;P.

278
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,960

280
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Li Xun, you're annoying.

281
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
With me, you no longer need to fight against the world with your body covered with thorns...

282
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,000
like these flowers.

283
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,100
I see.

284
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,400
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

285
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I've given up postgraduate studies.

286
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,500
As I said before,

287
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,000
you can do whatever you want.

288
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,100
I will support you.

293
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,000
- Old Gao, come out to help us. 
 - Coming. Coming.

294
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,100
- We brought the fish. 
 - Coming.

295
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,100
Old Han, long time no see.

296
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,200
- Have a drink later. 
 - Okay, let's have a drink later.

297
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,800
-  Have a drink heartily. 
 - Let's have a drink heartily.

298
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Coming. Shrimp.

299
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,300
How are they? They look really fresh.

300
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,000
How did you deep fry them?

301
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Let me serve the fish.

302
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,100
They were all caught this morning. These are all meat dishes.

303
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,300
Liu cooked them in different cooking ways. He is awesome.

304
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,400
Thanks, Mr. Han.

305
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
No, I'm just a peasant boss.

306
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,200
But a peasant boss is also good.

307
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,000
I won't be controlled. Right?

308
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,300
At work, I feel at ease.

309
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
- Is the fish cooked? 
  - Almost! 

310
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
Don't wait for him. Let's enjoy.

311
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,300
- Have a drink. 
 - Yes.

312
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,800
Have a drink.

313
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Congratulations, Mr. Han.

314
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,400
Business is booming.

315
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,200
Unexpectedly, Mr. Han is the first successful entrepreneur among us.

316
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,900
Cheers. Congratulations!

317
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,600
 Congratulations. Congratulations. Cheers. 

318
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

319
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
Congratulations.

320
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,000
Congratulations.

321
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
How is your cooperation in logistics?

322
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,300
The contract is being drafted these days.

323
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,600
Li Xun, thank you for establishing the website for me.

324
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,800
Since the website was put into use, my fish has been sold very well,

325
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,000
and many fish farmers in our village want to join us.

326
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,200
- Congratulations. 
 - Enjoy. Eat more.

327
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Why didn't I know about you establishing a website?

328
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,700
You don't know many things.

329
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,400
Really?

330
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,000
Coming! Zanthoxylum Armatum Boiled fish.

331
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
Why didn't you ask me for help?

332
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,100
What if you were scalded?

333
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,700
Don't worry.

334
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,900
Why are you looking at me? Enjoy your food.

335
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,200
Enjoy this. It's delicious.

336
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,900
What would you like? Let me pick it up for you.

337
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,500
I want that one. You picked the wrong one.

338
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Take it.

339
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,200
No.

340
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,770
That one.

341
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,900
   

342
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,910
This meal for closing the base seems to become a farewell dinner for graduation.

343
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,508
Maybe only a few of us can gather that day.

344
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,640
I heard that you've given up postgraduate studies.

345
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,060
Are you sure?

346
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,320
You've decided to be with Li Xun all your life?

347
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,070
Don't doubt me.

348
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,270
Don't forget something.

349
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,510
I'm Li Xun's girlfriend,

350
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:26,418
but I'm also the one with the highest GPA in our class.

351
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,540
I choose to follow him not just for love.

352
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,040
Okay.

353
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,108
To be honest, he's very capable,

354
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:42,400
but he is also prone to act on impulse.

355
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,144
He is arrogant due to his talent.

356
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:49,240
In cooperation, we can tolerate him.

357
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,768
However, the larger the team is, the more problems there will be.

358
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,600
Therefore, you must hold him back.

359
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,644
Li Xun can leave anyone except you.

360
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,050
I'll always be by his side.

361
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,660
Old Gao.

362
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,770
Thanks.

363
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,400
So, Mr. Li, Miss Zhu, what are you going to do?

364
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,340
I haven't thought about this deeply,

365
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,772
but I have a rough idea.

366
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,720
I want to be engaged in the medical industry.

367
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,140
Many people are interested in internet medical care

368
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,900
because they want to combine the internet with medical care

369
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,910
to enable patients to see a doctor at home.

370
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,690
But I think this is the wrong direction.

371
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,800
They just want to serve patients.

372
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,720
But the medical industry is a typical market dominated by the supplier.

373
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,624
In this world, there are many patients

374
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:55,380
but few high-quality medical resources.

375
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,410
What are you going to do?

376
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,014
My mother died of cancer.

377
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:09,898
The hospital where she stayed was very poor.

378
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:12,510
There were few resources available to doctors,

379
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,148
and different doctors gave totally different diagnoses.

380
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,178
Finally, they made a definite diagnosis several months later,

381
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,950
but she died soon after.

382
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,740
The main reason for the difficulty of seeing a doctor is not few doctors

383
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,564
but that few are experienced doctors.

384
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,178
So I think we need to give priority on how to maximize...

385
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:50,300
the utilization of doctors' experience.

386
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,060
Now, more than 90% of data from medical institutions is forgotten in their backstage database.

387
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,170
If we can integrate scientifically this wasted clinical data

388
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,080
and then feed them back to assist those inexperienced doctors in making a diagnosis

389
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,364
in a certain way...

390
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,100
How do we get this data?

391
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,140
Can they be shared among hospitals?

392
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,580
But their data formats should be different.

393
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,750
Will we integrate these resources digitally or in other ways?

394
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,250
Old Gao should be good at this.

395
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:26,150
Calm down. It's just an idea.

396
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,240
Yeah.

397
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,140
It's just a starting point, and the medical industry is biased toward public welfare,

398
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,570
so it's hard to make profit.

399
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,030
But I think it's worth doing.

400
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,026
This idea makes people have such a desire.

401
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,912
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

402
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,584
I hope the survival rate of cancer will be increased by 1%.

403
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,308
♫  I've been walking so long  ♫

404
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,796
Mr. Li is so confident.

405
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,760
Old Gao,

406
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,990
will you join us?

407
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,280
You can ask me for all you want.

408
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,789
I know this is quite a meaningful thing,

409
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,738
and I never dared imagine it,

410
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,424
but I've decided to go abroad and am applying for an offer.

411
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,240
That's also good.

412
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:56,218
Aren't you curious about it and don't you even want to ask me why?

413
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,868
Why?

414
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,494
The day before New Year's Day, I went to Xu Lina.

415
00:30:04,494 --> 00:30:06,440
I confessed to her,

416
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,290
but she refused me.

417
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,622
She said she likes a man who is admired

418
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:24,834
and is even respected by her.

419
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,050
Therefore, she likes you.

420
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,460
I know I'll achieve success very easily if I work with you to start a business.

421
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,830
It's much easier than going abroad for me,

422
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:48,796
but if I do so,

423
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:54,070
my name will never be heard.

424
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,750
Old Gao, I can't say any good words.

425
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,026
But good luck.

426
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,100
I hope your dream can come true.

427
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,932
I'm sincere.

428
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,396
Our L&amp;P will always wait for you to become our partner.

429
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:24,852
Our L&amp;P will always expect your joining.

430
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,114
Eternal trio!

431
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:29,900
Thanks.

432
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,272
 Li Xun! 

433
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,580
Stop drinking.

434
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,986
Where's Li Xun?

435
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:44,100
Li Xun!

436
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,930
Drink less.

437
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,650
Where's Li Xun?

438
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,810
- What's up? 
 -  Li Xun!

439
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,930
You came at the right time.

440
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,730
Li Xun, listen up.

441
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,780
Today, I must tell you something.

442
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,260
Otherwise, I'll be regretful for the rest of my life.

443
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,440
Li Xun, I like you.

444
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,182
Okay. You like him. Give me your beer.

445
00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:22,190
I've like you since I entered university,

446
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,850
but you scolded me in public at the base.

447
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,226
You wretch, I hate you!

448
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,740
Zhu Yun is good. She is gentle and cute.

449
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,660
She is much better, you repulsive man. Loathesome.

450
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,396
Don't take advantage of me.

451
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,860
What's wrong?

452
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,030
Don't vomit here!

453
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,378
Monitor, are you all right?

454
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:08,588
I'm-I'm all right.

455
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,840
Here you are. Warm water.

456
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,420
Thank you.

457
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,340
Mo-Monitor, I always-I always wanted to tell you something.

458
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,724
Go ahead.

459
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,794
I...

460
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,878
I...

461
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,720
I...

462
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,448
I can play the suona.

463
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
What?

464
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,542
I can play the suona.

465
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,450
But we no longer have any freshmen's joint performance.

466
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,450
I learned it for you.

467
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,070
I like you.

468
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,854
I already knew.

469
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,600
You knew?

470
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,190
I'm not a fool, but you are.

471
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,290
Haven't you realized it these three years?

472
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,756
I don't like you.

473
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,850
Don't think too much about it.

474
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,168
It's not that I don't like you.

475
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,070
I'm a selfish woman.

476
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,698
I only like myself.

477
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:59,220
The man I like is just the embodiment of my imagination.

478
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,610
Once I find something wrong with him, I don't like him anymore.

479
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,350
I don't treat him as my lover but admire him as a star instead.

480
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,710
Old Meng, we shouldn't be together.

481
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,948
However, if I have a chance, I'll go to watch you playing the suona.

482
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,818
Suona is good.

483
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:28,010
It's a traditional musical instrument.

484
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,070
As the saying goes, no one can't be touched by an erhu, 
  (Chinese two-stringed bowed musical instrument) 

485
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,210
and no soul can't be consoled by a suona. 
  (Chinese music instrument with double-reed horn) 

486
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,198
I just want to tell you that...

487
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,728
a man likes you.

488
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,060
If this thing can slightly warm your heart when you're unhappy,

489
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,746
in the future, it's enough.

490
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,684
I'm contented.

491
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,408
Thank you for being so good.

492
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,276
Because of you, I know the feelings of liking someone.

493
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,660
Why did they drink so much?

494
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,928
We won't graduate immediately and always be separated.

495
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,530
Why are you looking at me?

496
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,634
Am I prettier?

497
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:05,070
You just acted like a spoiled girl.

498
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,360
"Why didn't you ask me to help you with this?

499
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,770
What if you were scalded?"

500
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,280
Shut up! I acted like a spoiled girl?

501
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,224
This is Ren Di's coquettish style.

502
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,278
How can that be? He and I?

503
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,270
Don't deny it. This is what you call a long-term love.

504
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,780
Gosh.

505
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,660
You're sharing your experience with me?

506
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,800
You aren't even more experienced than me.

507
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,930
You're more experienced?

508
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,010
When did you gain experience?

509
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,610
Shut up.

Cheers.

522
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,740
I'm leaving.

523
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,010
- Hurry up. Hurry up. 
 - I'm leaving

524
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,360
- Bye-bye.  
 - Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

525
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,220
- See you next time. 
 - Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

526
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,630
Okay. Drinkers can't drive.

527
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,250
- I came here by taxi. 
 - Take a taxi. Take a taxi.

528
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,151
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

529
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,410
- Okay. Ojay.  
 - Bye.

530
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,710
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye. 
 - Take care!

531
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,650
- Where are you going? 
 - Take care on the way!

532
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,170
- It's out of fuel! 
 - Bye!

533
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,610
- Take care. 
 - Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

534
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,471
You're going the wrong way!

535
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:22,710
We're leaving, too.

536
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,400
- You two get along well.  
 - Get along well.

537
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,300
We're going home, too.

538
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,340
Brother Liu.

539
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,920
Yo.

540
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,630
Bye-bye.

541
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,782
Take care.

542
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,586
You sang well.

543
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,950
You came back from Beijing, why are you still sing that old song?

544
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,170
I have many new songs,

545
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,484
but I just like this one.

546
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,342
How time flies! It's been three years.

547
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,678
Nanhu University, I love you!

548
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,304
I hate you!

549
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:18,650
I love but also hate you!

550
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,550
Fang Shumiao, you're ill-behaved after drinking.

551
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,340
After drinking, you made a fuss, vomited, and shouted.

552
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,800
Look at me.

553
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,620
If you go on like this, I'll vomit on you.

554
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,160
What will our life be like three years from now?

555
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,570
Three years later, Ren Di must be popular.

556
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,760
By then, songs of Light Red will be spread everywhere,

557
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,970
and I'll earn money by selling her autographed photos.

558
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,116
Li Xun and Zhu Yun, your company may not surpass Google

559
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,450
but at least will match the BAT three years later.

560
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,000
Wow... BAT.

561
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,320
Old Gao, what about you?

562
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,820
Three years later, I'll graduate as a postgraduate.

563
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,324
I'll be nothing.

564
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:08,980
Then I hope you can join Google and fight against Li Xun.

565
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,251
- One of you will become Bill Gates, and the other Zuckerberg. 
 - I choose Bill Gates.

566
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:14,800
Both of them have nothing to do with Google.

567
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,310
Don't talk nonsense.

568
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,662
Yes.

569
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:21,650
As for Wu Mengxing, I hope you can have a happy marriage.

570
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,930
And go on playing the suona.

571
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,410
You play the suona and I'll listen.

572
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:29,610
Why don't you ask me what I want to do?

573
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,030
What do you want to do?

574
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,880
I want to make a fortune!

575
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,180
- Okay! 
 - And then?

576
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,580
Well, I-I must see your name on the Forbes China Celebrity List by then. Okay?

577
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,930
Okay, just wait and see.

578
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:46,580
After I make a fortune, each of the listeners here will be given a big villa.

579
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,726
Okay, it's a deal.

580
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,458
Girl, we should have a dream.

581
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:58,700
I hope our efforts will be paid, and our dreams will come true!

582
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,590
We'll all become who we want to be!

583
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,050
Who we want to be!

584
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,820
- Come true! 
 - Come on.

585
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,220
Come on.

 Beautiful scenery is enjoyable.

 The young are always proud and arrogant. 

602
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,000
 They look ahead but don't look down at the vicissitudes of life in the dirty corner. 

603
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,508
 If we held ourselves back, were more tolerant 

604
00:43:37,508 --> 00:43:40,442
 and modest, 

605
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:43,578
 would everything be different? 

606
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,486
 But we didn't do so. 

607
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:53,286
 We spent our youth arrogantly and waywardly.
