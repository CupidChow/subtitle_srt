1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,100


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,600
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,720
   

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,620
I can understand your fear.

23
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,250
I was watching and my legs were shaking that day.

24
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,820
But you were really pushed down.

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,230
They went too far.

26
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,800
Even if you really ruin our game, it's just a game.

27
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,740
But that's a game developed by you.

28
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,880
Not only me.

29
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,760
It's a result of everyone's work in this company.

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,370
You didn't expect it would cause such a serious consequence, right?

31
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,850
You thought it would not be a big deal even if you were caught hacking such a small company.

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,710
But even a small company contains the efforts of others.

33
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,920
Don't underestimate others.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,890
Li Xun told me about you.

35
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,210
Would you like to go somewhere with me?

36
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,530
Where is this place?

37
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,200
Go in and have a look.

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,700
Have a look.

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,580
This room, and all your stuff, was kept for you.

40
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,930
You've been dawdling for so long.

41
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,520
You didn't leave the city, let alone go abroad.

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,090
You were just waiting for him to come back to you.

43
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,430
Only he thinks of me as a person.

44
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,100
Li Xun won't leave.

45
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,820
You know him.

46
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,090
We still have something to do.

47
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,010
If you really care about him, just come to live here by yourself.

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,800
   

49
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,230
How is it?

50
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,820
Nailed it.

51
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,500
You're a great political commissar.

52
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,620
This working mind of yours.

53
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,820
What should we do next?

54
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,310
What should we do?

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,990
What should we do?

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,700
You two always have many ideals. Don't ask me.

57
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,560
Well, we want to bind him with a stone to sink him into the sea.

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

59
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,600
So I asked you what to do.

60
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,300
Let him stay in the company.

61
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,700
Do you accept it?

62
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,920
Well, if you don't keep him by your side, what if he does something bad again?

63
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,270
And if he escapes from the city, can you catch him?

64
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,120
It's better to keep him by our side.

65
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,130
Didn't you also say that he is strong?

66
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,720
Our company is short of labor. It's best if he can help us.

67
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,750
I love that. You give priority to the company's interests.

68
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,800
But he is a little ugly and will lower the overall look of our company.

69
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,020
I'm leaving. I'm on vacation.

70
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,850
I'm the boss. Did she ask for leave?

71
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,460
She's always like this?

72
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,280
She is much lovelier when she more timid.

73
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,900
She is lovely whatever she does because she is good-looking.

74
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,070
Hou Ning.

75
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,610
The same words.

76
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,800
If you are to leave, I won't keep you.

77
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
But as long as you follow me,

78
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,860
I will let you be an upright person.

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,520
I know.

80
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,770
How is Zhu Yun's cooking?

81
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,630
Horrible.

82
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,140
She finally has a disadvantage.

83
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,640
Political Commissar Zhu, why didn't you get a red background?

84
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,670
This one doesn't look good.

85
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,290
Get down. Be careful.

86
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,210
What are you doing? You even climb up with an adder.

87
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,380
    
 Mr. Dong, come and have a look.

88
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,870
    
 What is this?

89
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,150
    
 Look over here.

90
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,140
I can't understand wherever I look at it.

91
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,840
Let me explain.

92
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
New slogan.

93
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,190
Look. This is written by our Political Commissar Zhu

94
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,670
YOU means you. MONEY is money.

95
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,730
You know this as you play games. Devil.

96
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,470
- If you have money, you can be a devil. 
 - Illiterate.

97
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,810
You can make money without doing evil.

98
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,360
Well said. You can make money without doing evil.

99
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,270
You can make money without doing evil.

100
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,090
Why do you point at me?

101
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,970
Hi.

102
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,750
Hi. Morning.

103
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,190
Everyone is here.

104
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,230
Let me introduce him to you. This is my friend Hou Ning.

105
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,170
Zhang Fang, Zhao Teng, Guo Shijie.

106
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,520
Welcome.

107
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,860
Hou Ning, I'll clear up a place for you later.

108
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,470
Zhao Teng, help him install a computer.

109
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,670
I have all the materials ready. Take a look first.

110
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,360
You can ask Li Xun if you have any question at work.

111
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,570
I'll get a host for you.

112
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,360
No need. I've ordered one online.

113
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
It will be delivered here in the afternoon.

114
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,640
All right.

115
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,020
Our company's junk should have been eliminated.

116
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,660
I have a question.

117
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,610
If he gets a good computer, will he hack into others' computers faster?

118
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,370
Talk too much.

119
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,710
You hang it up for me?

120
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,900
You're quite self-aware.

121
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,270
Half the people in our company were once in prison.

122
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,700
And considering Hou Ning's conducting behaviors

123
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,120
and Mr. Dong's amazing way of solving problems,

124
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,550
I have to remind you guys at any time.

125
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,850
From this day onwards, I am the president of the Supervisory Committee of Flying.

126
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,510
I will keep an eye on you for Mr. Lin.

127
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,260
Think twice before you act.

128
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,950
Political Commissar Zhu, you love being an official.

129
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,600
Not convinced?

130
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,500
Zhang Fang dislikes Hou Ning.

131
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,300
But it may be a good thing for Hou Ning.

132
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,980
If he wants to live in this society honestly,

133
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,620
he must try to change people's views of him.

134
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,020
He can't escape like before.

135
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,170
But don't worry, Zhang Fang is warm-hearted albeit his sharp tongue.

136
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,510
He won't really bully Hou Ning.

137
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,470
You'd better worry about Zhang Fang.

138
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
What are you looking at?

139
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,700
By rights, I should stare at you in the company.

140
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,300
I warn you.

141
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,200
If you're not serious and become a drag on the company.

142
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,500
Besides Mr. Dong and Li Xun, I can also teach you a lesson.

143
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
Zhang Fang!

144
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
The top casino is online.

145
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,900
I-I didn't touch anything.

146
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,200
- What's that? 
 - It's not mine.

147
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,900
Fang.

148
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,400
I stored them on the online disk. I haven't watched it in the company.

149
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,300
Bullshit. What are you watching?

150
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,000
- Take a look. Take a look. 
 - I can also teach you a lesson.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,900
- Take a look. 
 - What?

152
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Why are you so mean?

153
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,600
Get to work.

154
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,100
Newcomer, you did it?

155
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,400
What do you mean? Showing off your skills here?

156
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
I confess I've watched it.

157
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,300
But I paid for it myself. I didn't hurt anyone.

158
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,600
How do you explain it?

159
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,400
Zhang Fang. Zhang Fang.

160
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I asked him to do this.

161
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,100
We won't make such a joke any more.

162
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,700
He is a newcomer. Please take care of him.

163
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,200
For your sake.

164
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,100
You know what, he is just like when you first came here.

165
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,000
What are you doing here?

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
- It's quite noisy. Are you fighting? 
 - Come here after cleaning up.

167
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,400
I was thinking our Flying Shelter has more and more complete staff.

168
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,000
What do you mean?

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Are you satirizing me?

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No. I dare not.

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Next week, the Blind Box of Love. Right?

172
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's going to have an internal test, right?

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,700
If it's delayed by you, I won't spare you, you know?

174
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
Hello.

175
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,500
Dong's Delivery will serve you.

176
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,700
What goods of yours?

177
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
Okay, okay.

178
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,400
I can't take three people.

179
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,300
- Wait for me. Wait for me! 
 - Go. Go!

180
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't delay your business.

181
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,080
   
   

182
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,600
       
     

183
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,200
How come the number of users has not increased these days?

184
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,100
You know it?

185
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,500
Zhang Fang, let me ask you.

186
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Did you promote it? Where did the money go?

187
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,300
I will say in all honesty.

188
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,100
I typed every promotion article word forword.

189
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
So you spent no money.

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Well, do you know even good wine is afraid of being sold deep in the alley?

191
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,300
Others invest in promotion as much as their development cost.

192
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
 Ren Di, do me a favor. 

193
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The Blind Box of Box has been internally tested for three days.

194
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
But the data is not optimistic.

195
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
What a shame.

196
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Isn't this project mainly undertaken by Li Xun?

197
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,300
It is said that he paid for it himself.

198
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,100
This time, he bet all he had on it.

199
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,400
You can arrange people to copy this game.

200
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
Let's make one by ourselves.

201
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,100
Is it worthwhile?

202
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,500
How much will it cost us to make one ourselves?

203
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,600
Don't be too short-sighted.

204
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
You just want to leave after earning by making our company listed?

205
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,500
Although L &amp; P has abundant funds, we don't have enough backbone projects.

206
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,200
The data of many games will decline significantly three to six months after they are online.

207
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,500
It is not easy to pass the examination and approval from the CSRC.

208
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,600
We also need a masterpiece.

209
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,300
Masterpiece?

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,400
You call this a masterpiece?

211
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,200
This game looks simple and straightforward.

212
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,900
But it is easier to be accepted by the market.

213
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
It has a large potential user base.

214
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Once it's played, it will be quite hot.

215
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,300
The disadvantage of Flying is publicity and promotion.

216
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,400
But this is our strong point.

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Are we fools if we don't launch it earlier and squeeze Flying out?

218
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,600
So sure?

219
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Absolutely.

220
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
I want to ask a question I shouldn't ask.

221
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Is it out of your professional judgment

222
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,500
or personal reason?

223
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,000
Intuition. This game will be hot.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,500
This market is too big.

225
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
There are too many games that will be hot.

226
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,600
Leave it alone.

227
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
We make our money.

228
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,400
Why are you staring at this?

229
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,000
You don't want to see Li Xun stand up, right?

230
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,900
I knew it.

231
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,600
As long as Li Xun farts, you would come up and smell it.

232
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,400
I disagree.

233
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,500
L &amp; P can't be led by your personal gratitude and resentment.

234
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,900
Fang Zhijing,

235
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,400
did I blind your eye?

236
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,100
Have you forgotten that pain?

237
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,500
Anyway, here is my tip.

238
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,600
Even if we develop one now, it's too late.

239
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
And even if you make it now,

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,400
we'll be more passive if Li Xun aims at us.

241
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,800
Leave this alone.

242
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,600
I have my own arrangements.

243
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,900
Gather people first.

244
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,800
Ask Dongliang to gather the backbone of the Development Department.

245
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,900
The Blind Box of Love will go online soon.

246
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,200
There's no time.

247
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Hurry up.

248
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,300
   

249
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
- Sorry for having kept you waiting so long. 
 - It's okay.

250
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Here you are.

251
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
How long has it been since he came to record?

252
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,600
He will come to record today.

253
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
He is delayed by a business dinner.

254
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,700
I think he can leave the band to specialize in having business dinners with others.

255
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,300
Wait a moment. Liu will be back soon.

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,500
Don't tell him that I came.

257
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,100
You can't wait for a while?

258
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Zhu Yun and Li Xun have a project that they have asked for your help.

259
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
You can contact them for specific content.

260
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,900
I have no friendship with them.

261
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,100
If you want me to help,

262
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
sit down and talk.

263
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Their company has launched a new game.

264
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,300
Go on.

265
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,000
- Here is the thing. They want... 
 - Hello, Mr. Zhao.

266
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,000
I must have a taste of your good wine.

267
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,100
Okay, okay, okay.

268
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,800
Okay, I'll be there right away.

269
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,500
Are you not recording songs today?

270
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Are you kidding? Mr. Zhao is waiting.

271
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,400
Ren Di, don't you want to know who Mr. Zhao is?

272
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,000
Fill it up. Fill it up.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,400
Mr. Zhao, last time we were wrong.

274
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,200
I hope that you will let go of us such nobodies. Come on. Cheers.

275
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,800
Mr. Zhao is the actual controller of Dongting International.

276
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,000
He strongly advocated signing five albums.

277
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Then you quit Light Red.

278
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
He was angry.

279
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,500
How much is compensation? I'll pay.

280
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,600
Mr. Zhao is not short of money.

281
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,800
He joined up with many record companies intending to block you.

282
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,100
Whatever.

283
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
After leaving Light Red, I won't play music anymore.

284
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,600
I know you don't care, but Liu does.

285
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
He has always thought of you as the soul of Light Red.

286
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Light Red can't develop without you.

287
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,400
  Come on. Let's drink to our hearts' content! 

288
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
 Cheers! 

289
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,900
He's been drinking with and socializing with people from record companies these days,

290
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,800
begging them not to block you.

291
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,600
♫  You dominate our relationship  ♫

292
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,000
♫  You said it's good to be alone  ♫

293
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,700
♫  With no burden or worry  ♫

294
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,900
♫  You rely on me as if I were your family  ♫

295
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,400
♫  You want me to do this  ♫

296
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
You.

297
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,190
♫  You always talk to me after drinking  ♫

298
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,700
Ren Di.

299
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,000
Come back.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,900
- Let go. 
 - Come back.

301
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,200
Ren Di, don't leave me. Okay?

302
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,000
♫  You said you can't pay back my kindness  ♫

303
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,900
♫  In fact, I don't ask you to pay back  ♫

304
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,000
♫  As long as I can stay with you  ♫

305
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,800
♫  Nothing else matters  ♫

306
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,800
♫  But tears of sadness  ♫

307
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,000
♫  Are still falling down  ♫

308
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,700
Just take a picture that doesn't show his face.

309
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Is it necessary to be so grand?

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,600
Now you know how those so-called life photos were taken.

311
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Every angle is carefully designed.

312
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,400
Every exposed thing has its intention.

313
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
But the band needs exposure.

314
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,600
You don't want to show up, so he helps.

315
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,500
You do your duties and cooperate tacitly.

316
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
It's good.

317
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,100
When it comes to this, I feel angry.

318
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,600
We have to live like dummies.

319
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,300
But Li Xun wants to remind you that when the time comes to post Weibo with text, there is no need to write about this game.

320
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,200
Don't make it look like an advertisement.

321
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
They will naturally dig up the details.

322
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,600
I really underestimated you two.

323
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,600
It was his idea.

324
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,700
It has nothing to do with me.

325
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,200
You both aim at me.

326
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,300
But think carefully.

327
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,000
When have you ever left me alone?

328
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Last time, you came to ask for money.

329
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
And this time, he called me and told me to meet him.

330
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Aren't you busy with activities every day?

331
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,900
He doesn't care about this.

332
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
I just left my work and went to meet him.

333
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,800
I don't think he's changed at all.

334
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,100
He is just like when he was a freshman.

335
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,200
We despised each other,

336
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,400
but somewhat, what's that phrase?

337
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
People of talent appreciate one another.

338
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
Yes, exactly.

339
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,300
You know what? I remember a sentence he said to me before.

340
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,400
He said that affection is a diamond cutting a diamond,

341
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,700
but love is letting go of ourselves.

342
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,200
He said that?

343
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,800
Actually, I really envy you.

344
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,200
You haven't changed for so many years,

345
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Both of you have clear goals and can let go of yourselves for each other.

346
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
When he was just released from jail,

347
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
seeing him looking like a jerk,

348
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
I really thought he deserved it.

349
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,000
I hoped he would live a miserable life.

350
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,500
But now I still hope he can succeed.

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
L &amp; P will be listed soon.

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is the last chance.

353
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,440
Are you still short of money?

354
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,420
Li Xun hasn't gone to look for investments, which means he thinks we can survive.

355
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,320
If you earn money easily, you will feel it's boring.

356
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,310
I'm an example.

357
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,680
In the past, when I was poor, I strived for every opportunity to perform.

358
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,410
But now...

359
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,950
       
     

360
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,220
   
     

361
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,020
   

362
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,820
Okay.

363
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,880
The next group will be here soon.

364
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,840
Get ready.

365
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,630
This way, everyone.

366
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,060
 Hello, sir. I need to make up for you. 

367
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,730
 I'll finish soon. 

368
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,750
Where do I stand?

369
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,230
- Pick a place yourself. 
 - I'm standing here.

370
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,550
Pick a place ourselves, and I'm sitting here?

371
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,440
You two stand here.

372
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,160
Come on. Let's change positions.

373
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,840
He is short.

374
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,350
Wait.

375
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,460
- What's wrong, Mr. Dong? 
 - What's wrong?

376
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,010
- I thought you would dole out money. 
 - Stylish.

377
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,100
Let's take a serious picture first.

378
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,920
- Cool picture. 
 - Okay.

379
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,250
I haven't taken pictures for several years.

380
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,950
I think the two group leaders should take a group picture alone.

381
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,310
One, two, three.

382
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,540
Come on.

383
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,760
One, two, three.

384
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,200
It's not natural to wear it.

385
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,450
This one is good for everyone.

386
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,010
-  What's good? I show half a face.  
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, just this one.

387
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,140
Why? I show half a face only.

388
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,270
Just take this one.

389
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,260
Just this one.

390
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,900
When you wear this suit, you look like one of the top 50 on the Forbes list.

391
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,100
Enough. Enough. This, this, this.

392
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,980
I like a fool.

393
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,920
It's really good. Why do you belittle yourself?

394
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,090
Yeah. You are not like Guo Xiaojian.

395
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,070
That dress belongs to your father, right?

396
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,140
Why do you dress like a manager in the lobby?

397
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,330
Stop it. I dress like a private car driver.

398
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,000
Who are you satirizing? Don't insult the private car driver.

399
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,700
What's wrong? I've improved to their level...

400
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,320
That's it. That's it.

401
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,980
Look.

402
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,480
Why is this so like that...

403
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,480
Let's just say the wedding photo.

404
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,880
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

405
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
A good match.

406
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,390
Change the background color to red later.

407
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,230
One, ten, hundred, comma, thousand, ten thousand...

408
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,230
Ten thousand.

409
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,070
Three million. I counted correctly? Is it real?

410
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,070
Our Blind Box of Love has been online for less than half a month,

411
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,710
and the current income is three million yuan.

412
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,790
    
What does this mean?

413
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,100
It means that in one year and five months, it will be over 100 million yuan.

414
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,460
Yes!

415
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,840
Why are you so vulgar? You just focus on money.

416
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,880
You know what?

417
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,580
This means, our business has been successful.

418
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,030
We succeeded.

419
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,620
- You know what? 
 - Our marketing is well done.

420
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,090
Once it became a keyword, its search number increased quickly.

421
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,030
But at this moment,

422
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,530
I shrunk its registration number and released four thousand accounts a day.

423
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,080
I don't care who will play it. This is called hunger marketing.

424
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,990
I must let them know, being able to play this game is a special thing to show off.

425
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,000
That's it.

426
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,740
Of course, it is mainly because of Mr. Dong's great leadership

427
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,550
and Li Xun's good plan.

428
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,470
So you have to keep up with the later promotions.

429
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,780
Rest assured. I'll listen to whatever you say later.

430
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,550
You and Li Xun are the two gods of our company.

431
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,000
Where's Li Xun?

432
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,120
Last night, he updated the patch and stayed up all night.

433
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,350
Now he is sleeping inside.

434
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,310
He works so hard.

435
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,160
If you turn off the light now, he'll wake up.

436
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,200
He doesn't like the dark.

437
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,860
Why?

438
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,050
Because the prison's lights are on 24 hours a day.

439
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
How is the current income?

440
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,250
You still care about this?

441
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,080
If you keep going like this, you will collapse.

442
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,150
Hurry home and go to bed.

443
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,760
    
 Our Development Department has studied the Blind Box of Love.

444
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,270
To make a similar game, at least half a year is needed.

445
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,600
Does this small game take so long?

446
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,900
Their game is very strange.

447
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,640
It has many game settings we haven't seen before.

448
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,590
If there is no template, it's difficult to achieve.

449
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,290
If we make one ourselves, how long will it take?

450
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,910
At least four months.

451
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,480
Hou Ning is good at taking care of people.

452
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,980
You can't always stay up.

453
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,960
The company won't go bankrupt without you.

454
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,720
What are you thinking about?

455
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,100
I was thinking.

456
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,340
If I'm not guessing wrong,

457
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,360
Gao Jianhong is already trying to find a way.

458
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,240
I see.

459
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,740
In the past, you would never have spent so much effort on games like Blind Box of Love.

460
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,060
You focus on it because L &amp; P is going to be listed soon

461
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,500
and you need to hurry up and try your best to push it to the top.

462
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,740
You want to attract Gao Jianhong to plagiarize, and then sue them for infringement.

463
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,900
Are my things so easy to imitate?

464
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,100
If I don't give him the source code, it will take them at least half a year to copy a little of this game.

465
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:58,290
No wonder when I read the code of the Blind Box of Love, I found many strange places.

466
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,230
You used to write code that was very readable.

467
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,760
But this time, you used a lot of complicated structures.

468
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,070
The more unique the code, the more traps there would be.

469
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,300
But even if they fall into a trap,

470
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,310
are we really going to give them half a year to make counterfeit goods?

471
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,250
So,

472
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,720
I will give them the source code directly.

473
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,940
I've checked cases of game infringement in China.

474
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,780
If it's just a simple imitation, it's hard to win.

475
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,700
Not to mention whether we can afford the lawyer's fees,

476
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,820
the backlog of game copyright lawsuits in China wouldn't be completed in ten years.

477
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,380
If we really fight a war of attrition with L &amp; P, we'll go bankrupt first.

478
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,700
Don't worry.

479
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,110
Gao Jianhong is more worried than us.

480
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,990
Who else knows about this plan?

481
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,060
Hou Ning and Dong Siyang. And you.

482
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,300
How about Zhao Teng and the others?

483
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,900
They don't know about it.

484
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,010
Remember.

485
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,380
The fewer people who know, the better.

486
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,410
How will you let them get the source code?

487
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,440
Will Gao Jianhong copy it directly?

488
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,390
Don't worry about that.

489
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,890
They are used to using evil ways.

490
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,550
They wouldn't take what I give them directly.

491
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,190
Gao Jianhong has been copying successful projects.

492
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,950
The reason why they can grow up is that the game market is too chaotic.

493
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,900
China has a large number of users.

494
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,010
They are highly tolerant of those fresh games.

495
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,020
But what is empty is empty after all.

496
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,200
People can't be stupid forever.

497
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:36,810
When users grow up, these companies without independent R &amp; D capabilities will go bankrupt.

498
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,410
But how can users grow up within just a few months?

499
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,240
L &amp; P will be listed soon.

500
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,720
Will they take this risk?

501
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,340
I'll force him to copy.

502
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,210
Such a small company is like a clown for us.

503
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,680
Remarketing won't help them.

504
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,910
Its annual income must be less than our company's monthly income.

505
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,500
Old Gao, you must not be led by Li Xun.

506
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,750
My review materials will be submitted soon.

507
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,680
Now is the most critical time.

508
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,990
For the company, you must bear it.

509
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,950
- Mr. Gao. 
 - Mr. Gao.

510
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,830
 What's your next goal? 

511
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,660
 To be No. 1 in the industry. 

512
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,110
 It's really ambitious. 

513
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:30,030
 But considering the industrial giants, like L &amp; P as your competitors, their strength... 

514
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,220
 Strength? 

515
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,700
 What kind of strength do you think L &amp; P has? 

516
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,450
 Copy and paste? 

517
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,110
 Companies like that 

518
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,730
 are not worthy to be our competitor. 

519
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,680
   

520
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,460
   

521
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,410
Old Gao.

522
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,540
Even if Li Xun develops eight games like the Blind Box of Love, he won't be a threat to us.

523
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,350
He's intending to irritate you.

524
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,960
I'll tell you one last time.

525
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,690
Take care of what you should take care of.

526
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,870
Don't tell me what to do.

527
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,570
If you don't want to work, you can leave.

528
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,400
But I must do this.

529
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,240
Got it.

530
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,340
These people are stubborn.

531
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,670
At first glance, it's from Southeast Asia.

532
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,810
Ancestral. Relational database management system implantation is nothing new.

533
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,030
How about we show a weakness and let Gao Jianhong take the source code away?

534
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,720
We've fought with them once.

535
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,660
With our strength, if we allow him to take the code away,

536
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,680
would they dare to copy it directly?

537
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,200
Then I'll do my best.

538
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,980
You are not allowed to enter here casually.

539
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
What are you doing?

540
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,500
I almost forgot you can understand it.

541
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,300
What do you think?

542
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,300
What's the hottest thing recently?

543
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,500
This is the background data of the Blind Box of Love?

544
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,200
What are you up to?

545
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,800
In case there is anything to learn from.

546
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,000
You want to steal the source code?

547
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,200
In the past, you copied others.

548
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,800
Now you dare to steal the source code?

549
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,500
You're breaking the law, you know?

550
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,700
These hackers are in Malaysia.

551
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,800
They can't find us.

552
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Isn't the company going public?

553
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,500
You really picked the right time.

554
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,700
It's nothing to do with me.

555
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,200
I've said all that I should say and persuade.

556
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
You two have a good talk.

557
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,900
Why are you like Fang Zhijing?

558
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,400
Do you care about money only?

559
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,000
You deal with Li Xun in such a dirty way.

560
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,600
That's what you want?

561
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,200
If you want to go to jail, leave me alone.

562
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,400
Let's get divorced.

563
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,600
You have wanted to say this for a long time, right?

564
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
That's what you really want to say.

565
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,400
You don't need so much bedding.

566
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
If you want a divorce, just tell me.

567
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,900
Count your losses first.

568
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,000
Don't be a loss leader.

569
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,000
Hopeless.

570
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm entering it. This firewall looks like paper.

571
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,200
Let's draw the snake out of the hole.

572
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,500
Then go straight to the nest.

573
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,300
   

574
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,140
Okay, that's it. 
    

575
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,200
   

576
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,310
   

577
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,300
Luna, this one was just delivered to our store.

578
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,400
Mr. Gao said you would like it.

579
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,800
It suits you.

580
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
This diamond is 12.13 carats.

581
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,800
It's just your birthday number. Mr. Gao especially had it made for you.

582
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,400
Do you like it?

583
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,200
My birthday hasn't arrived yet.

584
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I just wanted to give you a gift.

585
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
It doesn't matter what day it is.

586
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,800
Do you still remember?

587
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,200
The first time we ate together in a restaurant like this.

588
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,600
You and me at that time...

589
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,800
Of course I do.

590
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Lina, I'm sorry.

591
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,200
When I proposed to you,

592
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,500
I promised I would never be angry with you.

593
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,700
But I failed.

594
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,000
I was also impulsive that day.

595
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,200
But have you considered what I said?

596
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,000
Divorce.

597
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,800
We won't talk about this today.

598
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Don't you want to stay in Paris for a while?

599
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,700
I'll go with you.

600
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,900
We can buy a house together.

601
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,600
You apply for another school to get a master's degree.

602
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,500
Old Gao, actually, you don't have to give me anything.

603
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:20,600
I just think we haven't had a meal like this

604
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,000
and talked like this for a long time.

605
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,500
I thought as long as I succeeded in my career, my family would naturally be better.

606
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
But I overlooked the most important thing.

607
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,400
Your feelings.

608
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,800
All relationships need to have care.

609
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,500
Lina, I'm sorry for ignoring your feelings.

610
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,000
Would you like to give me another chance?

611
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:41,400


612
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,200
   

613
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,800
 I do especially want to thank someone. 

614
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,600
 That's Gao Jianhong, the CEO of L &amp; P. 

615
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,000
 Mr. Gao. 

616
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,600
 Are you jealous? 

617
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,600
 Later, more and more women will show up around Li Xun. 

618
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,800
 You'll regret it. 

619
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,900
 Li Xun, do you really think no one can defeat you? 

620
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,870
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

621
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

627
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,400
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫
