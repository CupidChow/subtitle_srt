1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:15,110


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,800
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,260
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,520
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,500
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,040
   

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,620
   

22
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,550
Who is it?

23
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,290
Nobody.

24
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,650
May I have the yellowish brown?

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,350
Here you are.

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,040
I think the main pictures can...

27
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,130
Xiuzhu, I think the bottom color is a bit...

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,060
I'll leave it to you.

29
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,540
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

30
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,270
- Here you are. 
 - Thank you.

31
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,340
Where is the painting?

32
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,560
I've saved it.

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,220
Thank you.

34
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,860
This is the first draft.

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,140
Check if you like the idea.

36
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,570
There are many details to be done.

37
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,690
Okay. Thanks.

38
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,540
This is a new toothbrush and towel.

39
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,910
Go wash up.

40
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,350
I'll make breakfast. Let me see you out to work after breakfast.

41
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,650
No need. I'll go by myself.

42
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,960
Good morning.

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,140
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

44
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,300
Group leader, I can't make it.

45
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,010
Forget it. I asked someone else for help.

46
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Who?

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,660
Let's have a meeting.

48
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,570
This is the painting.

49
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,500
This is your portrait.

50
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,370
I got it wrong.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,690
This one.

52
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,420
It's amazing.

53
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,910
It-It creates a kind of visual effect.

54
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,320
It isn't the common first-person perspective.

55
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,540
Group leader, who is the painter?

56
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,280
Can you introduce him to me?

57
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,010
I want to learn from him.

58
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,570
Wait. Tell me how much you paid for it.

59
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,620
It cost nothing.

60
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,050
Ask him to join us now. Act quickly.

61
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,080
Yes. Ask him to join us. He can replace me as art director.

62
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,440
You're dreaming.

63
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,170
Mr. Tian Xiuzhu drew it.

64
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,370
Mr. Tian.

65
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,140
Well, the auction price of his paintings is higher than the investment of our project.

66
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,020
How did you get the painting?

67
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,690
Oh, group leader, I think our company owes you a lot.

68
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,080
Li-Li Xun.

69
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,970
- That's great. 
 - Where is Li Xun?

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,370
What do you think about Mr. Tian's painting?

71
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,000
It's awesome. This is the best painting I've seen.

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
What's wrong with him?

73
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,290
He is angry?

74
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,090
I don't know.

75
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,240
Don't pretend. You're jealous.

76
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,200
Is this poster enough?

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,540
Our publication has achieved initial success. We don't have enough money for promotional expenses now.

78
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
Who told you we're short of money for promotional expenses?

79
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,160
It's impossible that my company is short of money.

80
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,830
Zhang Fang, come in.

81
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,560
 I'm here. 

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,010
We don't have enough money for promotional expenses?

83
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,970
It's impossible that our big company has no money.

84
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,270
Mr. Dong, I've promised to put the money where it matters most.

85
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,000
Look. The amount available in our account now is 76,501.82 yuan.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to put everything into promotions. It's more than sufficient.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,050
Did you hear what he said?

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,070
Hello.

89
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,870
Hello. Dong's Special Car will serve you.

90
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,670
- Mr. Dong is right. 
 - How do I get more money for promotions?

91
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,030
Come back.

92
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,160
We must make this clear.

93
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,200
- Okay. 
 - Mr. Dong.

94
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm asking for money to do promotions from you. Why are you stopping me?

95
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,010
Mr. Dong is a decent man. Can you save his face in public?

96
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,230
As the CFO, I know more about the company than you do.

97
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,190
The company has been losing money since its establishment.

98
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,790
Now we don't have the amount you need.

99
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,310
You can use my wages.

100
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,590
- No kidding. 
 - I'm serious.

101
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,820
Me, too.

102
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,580
First, your wages are much less than the amount we need.

103
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,700
Second, even if you want to pay with your wages, Mr. Dong won't agree.

104
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,380
Why?

105
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,050
He said if a company can only survive by reducing its employees' wages,

106
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,880
the company shouldn't exist.

107
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,270
Dong Siyang said that?

108
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,350
That's probably what it means.

109
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,260
Of course, I polished it a little.

110
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,690
But the problem is with just a little money, how should we do promotions?

111
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,330
This is what I think.

112
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,280
Let's put the money where it matters most.

113
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,740
On the day the game is launched, put all money to increase its flow.

114
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,760
- Increase its flow? 
 - Yes. To push it to first place.

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,350
It won't help unless you can do that in batches and combine other following promotions.

116
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,090
We have no Party A.

117
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,490
I tried my best to find a way, but he rejected it.

118
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,280
He dampened my spirit.

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,160
Come up with a solution.

120
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,310
Hello, Brother Xiuzhu.

121
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm coming.

122
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,500
He is great.

123
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,810
He comes to help when needed.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,790
Brother Xiuzhu.

125
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,730
Your charger.

126
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm really busy. I was just looking for it.

127
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,260
Being the supervisor is exhausting.

128
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,990
You couldn't sleep well.

129
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,180
By the way, when did you draw my portrait?

130
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,680
Last night. I drew it freehand.

131
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
You didn't tell me.

132
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,330
I thought you only drew the poster and showed the portrait accidentally.

133
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,720
I hope it didn't cause any trouble.

134
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
Nothing major.

135
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,630
Seeing you sleep last night,

136
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,610
It suddenly occurred to me that we've known each other for so long and I haven't drawn a single picture of you.

137
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,070
Remember to sleep well no matter how tired you are.

138
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,950
Thanks.

139
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,460
Why are you thanking him?

140
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,650
He gave me the idea of the poster.

141
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,220
Someone put a poster on my windshield.

142
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,330
I was inspired, or I wouldn't have finished it so quickly.

143
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,900
I wondered why Xiuzhu could understand the soul of the project so quickly.

144
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,140
It turned out that someone helped him.

145
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,140
Thank you.

146
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,560
But how did you know where I lived and his license plate number?

147
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,260
- Did you ring the doorbell yesterday? 
 - Have you finished?

148
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,120
Oh.

149
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,750
Do you have any ideas about the promotions?

150
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,220
But we're really short of money.

151
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,110
Turn to the painter.

152
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,590
He likes you. He will do anything for you.

153
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,710
Don't feel embarrassed.

154
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,180
You like all kinds of men.

155
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,240
What do you mean?

156
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,060
It seems that you don't know how to choose a man.

157
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,030
Li Xun, you'd better shut up.

158
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,700
Is he chasing you or are you chasing him?

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm telling you to shut up.

160
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,190
Are you jealous?

161
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,490
You're still so narcissistic.

162
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,980
Did the painter confess to you?

163
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,150
It won't be you being self-indulgent again, is it?

164
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,490
You don't have to insult people so grotesquely, do you?

165
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,490
So what if I'm with him? Do I owe you?

166
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,630
I liked you. So what?

167
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,580
Go to ask anyone out there if he remembers the one who he liked at 18.

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,060
You loved me as a freshman.

169
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,850
It's a pity that I didn't feel anything for you at that time.

170
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,770
Continue to pretend.

171
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,000
I just remember someone loved to sit next to me,

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,890
staring at me from the beginning of class to the end of get out of class.

173
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,500
The flow chart I drew randomly in class ws picked up like a treasure.

174
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,990
Tell me who she was.

175
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:41,150
I still remember someone deliberately stealing my meals in the cafeteria just to get to know me.

176
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,810
In programming class, she was always the last one to leave just so she could watch me do my homework on the computer.

177
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,370
She also spent hundreds of dollars on her hair to express her love to me,

178
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,900
for fear that I would be snatched away.

179
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,710
The most ridiculous thing is that she loved to say such childish things.

180
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,700
"Choose me."

181
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,580
"I'll never betray you."

182
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,480
You shouldn't say that.

183
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,280
You went too far.

184
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,480
Do not rake up the past as a man.

185
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,630
Well, you wer really harsh today.

186
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,980
She is such a nice girl.

187
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,160
Think about it.

188
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,600
Without her help, you can't find a job

189
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,320
with a criminal record, let alone reading here.

190
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,670
She did all the work.

191
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,170
Besides, the GPU she bought costs a month of wages.

192
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,040
Yes. I'll hang to whoever gives me a Titan.

193
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,080
Don't talk nonsense.

194
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,520
Shut up. Go to work.

195
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,210
If you piss her off, we're toast.

196
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,740
I know she trusts me.

197
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,810
She trusts me so much that

198
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,700
I can hurt her multiple times with just one word

199
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,390
and one action.

200
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,350
So you did it on purpose?

201
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,820
I know how to hurt her all too well.

202
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,610
Why?

203
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,830
I think she's going back little by little.

204
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,320
I can't give her more hope.

205
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,490
You don't want to give her hope or you don't want to give yourself hope?

206
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,260
You insult the past.

207
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,280
Are you comfortable?

208
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,560
You still can't control yourself.

209
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,550
I'll just ask you, do you still like her?

210
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,960
No.

211
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,300
♫  Memories lie  ♫

212

213
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,930
Since you don't like her, why do you care about what she does with that painter?

214
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,960
Are you such a monster?

215
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,010
I really have nothing to say to you about this.

216
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,440
You said she was trying her best to help you,

217
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,960
but you scolded her instead. Are you satisfied now?

218
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,760
♫  How do I forgive the torn past?  ♫

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,790
 What's wrong? It's late. 

241
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,590
- Hello. 
  - Zhu Yun. 

242
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,930
Brother Xiuzhu.

243

 What's wrong with you? Hello? 

244
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,870
 Hello, Zhu Yun. 

245
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,190
 Hello? 

246
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,220
   
 (Brand name: Lexapro, treats depression and anxiety) 

247
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,040
   

248
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,960
   

249
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,130
Hello.

250
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,100
 Li Xun, Zhu Yun had an accident. 

251
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,940
 Where are you now? 

252
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,140
Excuse me.

253
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,440
- Where is Ward 316? 
 - Turn right to the second room.

254
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,210
This way?

255
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,820
   

256
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,180
This is what you medicine you gave her.

257
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,390
You should ask how long she's been taking these pills.

258
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,000
Zhu Yun drank too much wine last night and took a few more pills

259
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,770
which caused her blood pressure to drop out and to faint.

260
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,240
Fortunately, it didn't reach the point of gastric lavage.

261
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,280
    
 These drugs have serious side effects,

262
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,150
but she has been taking them for three years.

263
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,600
You probably don't know how she lived abroad.

264
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,940
When she was abroad,

265
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,990
she kept turning like a spinning top, never stopping.

266
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,030
She wouldn't stop.

267
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,840
She dared not stop.

268
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,430
Once she came to my place to do business,

269
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,800
I insisted on taking her out for a walk.

270
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,180
She stood on the beach.

271
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,480
I went to buy her a pastry.

272
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,370
When I came back, she stood there rigidly.

273
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,660
Do you know...

274
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,980
what I saw in her eyes at that moment?

275
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,770
Relief.

276
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,570
I won't let you hurt her again.

277
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,900
Tian Xiuzhu.

278
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,280
Thank you for taking care of her.

279
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,070
Thank me?

280
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,690
What position do you have to thank me?

281
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,650

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,910
It has popularity, but no profit.

324
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,920
They really did a good job with the content.

325
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,680
Especially the ingeniously designed plot, which allows the player to immerse themselves.

326
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,230
The plot is obviously well thought out,

327
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,890
but it's also a double-edged sword.

328
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,080
The plot has an invisible threshold,

329
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,220
blocking casual players who spend little time using their brains and are not willing to buy it.

330
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,810
So it's a bit of a thankless game for them

331
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,870
Yes, ours is obviously better to use and the graphics are much more refined than theirs,

332
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,620
so it is easier to market out of the circle.

333
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,200
When will it be launched?

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,440
It will be the first of next month at the earliest.

335
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,480
That's too late. Those players were all snatched away by Invincible General.

336
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,450
We are already pretty fast.

337
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,250
Look around. Everyone is working overtime to catch up with the progress.

338
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,740
After all, we started from scratch.

339
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,700
I don't care.

340
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,670
I'll transfer Group 6 and 7 to you.

341
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,380
They can put their work aside.

342
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,700
The game must be launched on the 20th of this month.

343
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,590
Old Gao, Group 6 and 7 will finish their project soon.

344
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,590
That game is more promising than Rivalry Among Seven Powers.

345
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,750
You shouldn't delay the company's normal business

346
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:58,320
and disrupt all the company's plans to fight with Li Xun.

347
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,350
Think about it. Is it worth keeping an eye on Li Xun?

348
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,870
Is it worth spending so much money and manpower on him?

349
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,420
Do I need your permission to do anything now?

350
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,440
No. I didn't mean that, Old Gao.

351
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,930
Listen.

352
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,340
What is the biggest goal of our company now?

353
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,280
Wasn't it just to get the company listed?

354
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,030
When we achieve that goal, what is Li Xun to us then?

355
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,810
It'll take him eight lifetimes to catch up to us.

356
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,010
So I think now we just need to contain him.

357
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:42,430
I can call the game websites immediately to have all their games taken off the shelves.

358
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,690
Don't forget...

359
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,440
Invincible General will be launched on the 18th.

360
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,630
Do as I say.

361
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,530
- No. Old Gao... 
 - You can get off work.

362
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,830
Let's go.

363
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,640
Let me know if there is anything you want to eat when you get back.

364
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,490
Something light.

365
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,490
Well, I'll make steamed perch first.

366
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,800
Okay.

367
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,950
Then stir-fried cabbage.

368
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,000
Stir-fried cabbage.

369
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,390
Hello.

370
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,280
Mr. Lin.

371
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,800
It's me.

372
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,820
   

373
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,180
How long have you been waiting?

374
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,010
Half a day.

375
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,240
Just 10 minutes.

376
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,590
Can't we just talk properly with each other?

377
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,180
Let's go.

378
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,160
You even thought of Ms. Zhao.

379
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,290
I haven't contacted Mr. Lin since graduation,

380
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,780
so I didn't know that she has been a popular history joker on Weibo.

381
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,160
She is a professor in the Department of History.

382
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,250
Few people know that she and Mr. Lin are a couple.

383
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,380
She is popular on Weibo. She often gives live lectures.

384
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,790
Her fans are young people interested in history.

385
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,090
In fact, they're the target users of Invincible General.

386
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,720
Let's find her and we'll get twice the result with half the effort.

387
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,600
I just don’t know that when we made such a big fuss back then, did it affect Professor Lin?

388
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,990
What are you afraid of? At least he is still willing to see us.

389
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,100
He liked you best, right?

390
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,960
You worked so hard as the class rep back then.

391
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,250
Who doesn't know that he liked you the most?

392
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,900
Mr. Lin.

393
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,320
It's really you two.

394
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,450
Come in.

395
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,270
Well. Come on.

396
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,830
Hurry up.

397
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,650
Hurry up. No need to change your shoes.

398
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,220
Just take a seat.

399
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,530
You're all grown up.

400
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,590
Professor, you haven't changed at all.

401
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,130
I'm old now.

402
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,390
Don't keep looking.  Sit down and eat.

403
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,770
- Come on. 
 - Thanks, Mrs. Zhao.

404
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,990
- Well, sit down. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Never mind.

405
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,150
Sit down.

406
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:58,140
Since you called us that day, Mr. Lin has been so happy.

407
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,420
If you didn't come, I'd have to send him to the hospital.

408
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,150
Take a seat.

409
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,970
Do you like the porridge?

410
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes.

411
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,380
It tastes better than that in prison.

412
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,100
You're thinner than before.

413
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,580
Yes.

414
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,640
The food in the prison was good actually.

415
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,540
There was porridge in the morning and evening.

416
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,490
Two dishes and one soup at noon. Both meat and vegetable.

417
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,120
At first, I thought it was good.

418
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,000
But I couldn't get used to it after a long time,

419
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,570
just like dining in the canteen of our school.

420
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,610
In fact, I found there is no difference between school and prison.

421
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,310
You-You are comparing Nanhu University to a prison?

422
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,120
What are we as professors? Are we prison guards?

423
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,970
You're my cellmate.

424
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,500
Cellmate.

425
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,620
Enjoy it.

426
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,380
Why don't you eat some porridge?

427
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,740
I...

428
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,910
What's wrong?

429
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,680
Well. I need your help.

430
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,360
Go ahead.

431
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,850
Recently we developed a history game.

432
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,020
We'd like Mrs. Lin to give us some advice.

433
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,160
No problem.

434
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,650
Dear, can you?

435
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,650
No.

436
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,500
No problem.

437
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,640
Have a talk with Li Xun. Let's talk inside, Zhu Yun.

438
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,930
Okay.

439
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,760
Mr. Lin, where did you hide your private money?

440
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,650
You little brat.

441
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,870
   

442
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,350
But your company is still small.

443
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,270
Small companies are interesting.

444
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,100
You are still the same, unconventional as ever.

445
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,780
But your career is a big deal.

446
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,290
Well, I know some big companies,

447
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,510
research institutes, and graduate schools.

448
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,860
Don't bother, Professor.

449
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,100
I'm fine with this company.

450
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:27,830
Then I want to ask how other colleagues in your company treat you.

451
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,200
They are true men.

452
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,900
I like them very much.

453
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,920
Happy to hear that.

454
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,950
Li Xun, it won't be easy for you.

455
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,070
I'll go step by step.

456
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,060
You're stubborn.

457
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,810
But keep my words in mind.

458
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,480
No matter what difficulties you may encounter in the future,

459
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,400
follow the right path.

460
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,470
Don't be willful.

461
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,840
Don't spoil yourself again.

462
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,890
Okay.

463
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,450
Don't worry.

464
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:36,280
Zhu Yun, this game is set in the Warring States Period.

465
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,300
Yes.

466
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
Give me more details.

467
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,370
The opening chapter is set in 239 BC.

468
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,430
The King of Qin formally took over?

469
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,470
Yes.

470
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,990
Why did you choose that year?

471
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:54,500
The first important battle we set in the game is the king's fight against Lao Ai's rebels.

472
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,840
After the battle, the king completely exiled his eyesore, Lü Buwei

473
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,950
and began to annex the Six Kingdoms.

474
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:03,710
We think this is a good start.

475
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,020
   

476
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,610
   

477
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,910
Master is worthy of everyone.

478
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,160
What she said goes straight to the heart of the matter.

479
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,230
It would be nice if we could meet more often in the future.

480
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,460
Mrs. Zhao will be the consultant of this project.

481
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,700
If you have any questions in the future, just ask her.

482
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,980
When did you talk about further cooperation with her?

483
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,820
She will rush out a soft advert to promote the game in two days.

484
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,040
At that time, it will be sent out according to the game update speed.

485
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,410
This project can be promoted as the most rigorous historical game in history.

486
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,660
But will her being our gaming advisor tarnish her image as a scholar?

487
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,060
I don't know.

488
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,840
You don't worry at all?

489
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,200
Why are you here when you're so worried about tarnishing her reputation?

490
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,670
Don't worry, she agreed to help us and wants to help us.

491
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,080
Get in the car.

492
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,700
No need. I'll go by myself.

493
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,610
Be careful.

494
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:37,160
Zhu Yun.

495
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,810
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,490
I'm not seriously ill. You don't have to say you're sorry.

497
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,290
I have been like this since I was a child. I like to compete with myself.

498
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,200
Medicine can relieve my anxiety. You don't have to take it to heart.

499
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,540
I also owe you an apology for the past.

500
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,200
You said you were...

501
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,050
happy abroad last time,

502
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,250
and I believed it.

503
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,220
I didn't think about...

504
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,700
how you spent your time these years.

505
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,160
You even feel guilty.

506
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,950
You're much braver than me.

507
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,100
While lying in the hospital I thought a lot about why I stayed.

508
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,270
I used to be afraid to think about this.

509
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,850
I also resisted reminding myself...

510
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,120
about how important you are to me.

511
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,050
You don't regret working in such a small company with me?

512
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,920
No. Don't crow over it. I don't work there for you.

513
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,750
Actually, I like Flying.

514
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,400
Although Xiaojian isn't good at drawing,

515
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,900
but in order to draw concept posters, he is losing his hair.

516
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,880
And Zhao Teng. When I first showed him my game plan,

517
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,990
his eyes almost popped out.

518
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,800
Later when we got the beginning battle done, his eyes lit up instantly.

519
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,490
Flying is a small company, but each of us has a power.

520
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,190
What is insignificant can surprise us with daily progress.

521
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:15,700
Li Xun, Gao Jianhong is right.

522
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,770
You can't climb a mountain alone.

523
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,570
Don't lower your head.

524
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,330
I won't allow it.

525
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,600
But you also need us.

526
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,460
I noticed that you've read just about one-sixth of the books I gave you.

527
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:40,900
You're much slower than before.

528
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,320
Finally, you got the chance to lead me.

529
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,390
Yes. I've been expecting this day for many years.

530
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,740
A common colleague.

531
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,320
A common colleague.

532
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,320
See you.

533
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,750
 I envy him. He never looks back. 

534
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,040
 He has everything I once lacked: 

535
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,560
 confidence, courage, strength, and freedom. 

536
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,830
 He also has a firm direction. 

537
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,720
 He'll never doubt himself. 

538
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,520
 Perhaps he is special to me. 

539
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,890
 Maybe everyone has such a person in their life. 

540
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,220
 He's scarred, but we admire him. 

541
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,230
 He repents, but it's still worth pursuing him. 

542
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:22,100


543
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,640
   

544
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,760
 I just want to beat him so that he can't turn over. 

545
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,840
 I want to let him know that the current game market is L&amp;P's. 

546
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
 Li Xun, don't stop me. I don't want to be imprisoned again. 

547
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,680
 Calm down. 

548
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,440
 Illegal hacking into a computer system is punishable by several years. 

549
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,890
 Li Xun, look at those around you. 

550
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,800
 What else have you missed? 

551
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,020
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

552
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,080
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

553
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:02,680
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

554
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,500
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

555
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,880
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

556
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,920
♫  We will not separate  ♫

557
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,040
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

558
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,480
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

559
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,520
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

560
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:39,380
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

561
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:47,260
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

562
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,720
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,960
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

566

♫  That hot firework  ♫

568

♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

569
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,560
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

570
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,180
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

574
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,380
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

575
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,700
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

576
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,400
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

577
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:16,060
