1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,100


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,400
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,120
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,760
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,920
   

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,870
   

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,560
   

24
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,470
You're back.

25
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,410
I can't do it anymore.  I'm so exhausted.

26
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
Come here.

27
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,500
You're tired.

28
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,520
What's wrong?

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,760
Li Xun, am I too nice to you?

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,570
It seems that since we have gotten together, your abdominal muscles have reduced to one.

31
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,200
Who said?

32
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,710
Guess what I saw in our school today.

33
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,550
You saw Liu Sisi?

34
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,560
Liu Sisi.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,850
You mentioned her again. You mentioned her again.

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,840
Who did you see?

37
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,050
This year's Information Security Competition will be held in our school.

38
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,700
Really?

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,410
I read the competition catalog and saw something interesting.

40
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,270
What is it?

41
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,060
Our matchmaker is back.

42
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,840
Fang Zhijing.

43
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,610
He makes me speechless.

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,180
Every time when I want to forget him, he has to show up and flaunt his existence.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,140
Drug dealers have a great influence in China, especially cancer drugs.

46
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,800
Yes. They can penetrate into all companies.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,850
Old Gao, come in.

48
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,230
They can penetrate into all companies.

49
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,620
If we can have a smooth cooperation, it'll be a great convenience

50
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,700
to the experimental data of L&amp;P company.

51
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,180
Gao.

52
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,000
Li Xun is over there.

53
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,520
Old Gao, what are you doing here?

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,870
There's something I'd like to talk about with you.

55
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,320
Have a seat.

56
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,930
- Would you like some water? 
 - No need.

57
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,570
What's wrong?

58
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,440
You look anxious.

59
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,100
I saw Fang Zhijing.

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,500
I saw him staying with the organizing committee.

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,840
They seemed to talk about the competition three years ago.

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,270
Li Xun, can you get as far away from him as possible?

63
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,500
Don't provoke him during this period.

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,360
You should tell him to do that.

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,020
I can't handle him. I can only ask you.

66
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,220
I've submitted our winning materials from the last competition to the University of London.

67
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,070
Without further ado, I'll get the offer after a while.

68
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,580
It's critical to me during this period.

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,760
I can make no mistake.

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,550
I see.

71
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,630
Li Xun, I'm begging you.

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,330
Don't say that.

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Old Gao, don't worry.

74
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,760
I have no time to do that.

75
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,470
I'll fetch you some water.

76
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,220
 The location of the spotlights. 

77
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,610
 Check them. 

78
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,980
 - Have you both confirmed the information flow? 
 - Yes. 

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,440
 Is there any problem with the procedure? 

80
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,520
 Leave it to me. 

81
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,770
Old Lin, this is for you.

82
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,700
Enter the competition items for me.

83
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,470
I have no time.

84
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,870
Please ask someone else.

85
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,110
Who?

86
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,880
If I could, I wouldn't come to you. You're my last choice.

87
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,570
Zhu Yun left with you.

88
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,810
She didn't answer my phone call. Who can I ask for help?

89
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,870
Hurry up. Enter it now.

90
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,920
Mister, I'll help you.

91
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,970
- You're...
 - My name is Fang Zhijing.

92
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,670
Fang...

93
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,810
We knew each other in the first competition.

94
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,720
- Fang Zhijing from Information Technology University. 
 - Yes.

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,760
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

96
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,210
Mister, what else should I pay attention to? Just tell me.

97
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,670
No. Thank you.

98
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,830
Leave it to him if he wants to,

99
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,170
or it may be tricky if I see and use something improper.

100
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,320
- I'll help you. 
 -  Okay.

101
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm leaving.

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,910
Stop!

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,360
Test all the machines for me.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,080
Don't go before you confirm that all software of the team can work.

105
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,940
Don't be lazy.

106
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,640
Check the machine there.

107
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,670
That's what Li Xun is like.

108
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,200
He is a bit stubborn.

109
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,880
Don't take it to heart.

110
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,760
I won't. It happened long ago.

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,100
It was all my fault. I won't blame him.

112
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,530
Young people make mistakes easily.

113
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,110
There is still a long way to go.

114
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,750
Perhaps you'll be good friends.

115
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,900
You're right. I heard men of talent

116
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,770
come out one after another from the Computer Science Department of Nanhu University.

117
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,910
With your constant guidance, no wonder Li Xun is so capable.

118
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,910
Li Xun is somehow special.

119
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,080
In terms of programming, students are completely different from each other.

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,510
If a student can't understand, even a great teacher can't help.

121
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,480
Li Xun dropped out of school and started a company as a senior.

122
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,180
I always tell him to slow down as he is still young.

123
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,020
But he won't wait.

124
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,520
Look, so many famous hospitals

125
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,670
and pharmaceutical factories across the country seek cooperation from him.

126
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,290
Thinking it was inappropriate, he declined them.

127
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,910
Yes.

128
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,380
Only he can reduce the error rate to below 1%.

129
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,810
Now it's a seller's market.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,330
It's good times for you young people.

131
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,840
My generation is less courageous, creative, and bold than you.

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,380
- Back then,  we... 
 - Mister, I finished my work. I'll go to the bathroom.

133
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,690
Okay.

134
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,000
 Mister, how do we connect this? 

135
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,940
That old man has no sense at all.

136
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,880
No wonder he is still at a low rank.

137
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,470
Damn.

138
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,410
Hello.

139
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,590
The connection was bad.

140
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,350
Tomorrow morning?

141
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,590
Okay. I see.

142
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,330
What's wrong? What can I do for you?

143
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,080
Can we talk?

144
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,490
Go ahead.

145
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,650
Why did you go to the organizing committee?

146
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,300
You're well-informed.

147
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,510
Does it have anything to do with you?

148
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,730
It really has nothing to do with me?

149
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,730
Group Leader Fang, can you stop playing dirty and be responsible?

150
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,760
You don't need an award or go abroad.

151
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,460
What's your weakness?

152
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,930
It seems that you care about Gao Jianhong.

153
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,000
I know it.

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,300
He has been asking what I said to the organizing committee these two days.

155
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,590
He worries that he can't get the offer, right?

156
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,250
Okay. I won't cause trouble,

157
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,160
but I have a condition.

158
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,390
You apologize to me.

159
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,660
Don't take yourself seriously.

160
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,960
If you apologize to me in public at the opening ceremony of this year's competition

161
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,190
and admit that what you did was baseless,

162
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,120
you slandered me and damaged my reputation,

163
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,230
I'll think about it.

164
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,710
If you apologize, Gao Jianhong will have a promising future.

165
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,570
It's reasonable, right?

166
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,040
Okay.

167
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
I promise.

168
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,260
I can apologize in public, but I won't apologize to you.

169
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,180
It's true that you colluded with the sponsor to set the award.

170
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll apologize to the organizing committee

171
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,130
and every contestant that

172
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,680
I broke the rules and affected the competition.

173
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
That's all.

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,460
They have nothing to do with me.

175
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,370
Fang Zhijing,

176
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,110
you'd better accept that.

177
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,550
If I find you playing dirty secretly,

178
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,090
I won't let you go as I did last time.

179
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,780
I'll destroy you completely.

180
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,920
Don't threaten me.

181
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,300
I don't buy it.

182
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,360
This is Nanhu University. Good luck.

183
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,560
Okay.

184
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,570
This time, we'll be done.

185
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,330
   

186
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,990
Leaders of the organizing committee, judges, teachers and students, good morning.

187
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,470
The semi-finals and finals of this year's Nanhu University Students' Information Security Competition

188
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,720
will be held at Nanhu University.

189
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,580
It's our great honor.

190
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,500
On behalf of Nanhu University, I'd like to accord a hearty welcome to all of you.

191
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,000
This competition...

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,670
Old Lin, let me say something.

193
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,480
Hello, everyone. My name is Li Xun.

194
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,510
All of you here should remember the competition three years ago,

195
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,400
as I did something that broke the rules

196
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,680
of the competition out of my impulsion.

197
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,710
 It's an insult to the fairness of the competition 

198
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,370
 that you can win a star prize for this shabby project. 

199
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,000
I interrupted the competition

200
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,850
and caused influence and losses to all contestants.

201
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,370
Am I afraid of responsibility or are you afraid of responsibility?

202
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,350
I'd like to apologize to the organizing committee

203
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,210
and every contestant.

204
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,490
 Li Xun. Li Xun. Li Xun. 

205
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:51,060
I sincerely hope that such a thing will never happen again.

206
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,990
   

207
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,340
Good. Great.

208
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,710
Li-Li Xun came here and admitted his mistake with courage.

209
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,550
Thanks.

210
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,830
When I get my offer, I'll treat you to dinner.

211
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,850
Not bad getting treated to a meal.

212
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,340
Hello, everyone.

213
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,230
Now that Li Xun mentioned it,

214
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,560
on behalf of the organizing committee,

215
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,690
I will announce a decision we've made recently.

216
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,820
Since we received reports,

217
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,660
the organizing committee attached great importance to it

218
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,670
and established a special investigation team.

219
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:57,280
We confirmed that Li Xun broke the competition order three years ago

220
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,790
causing extremely bad effects.

221
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,790
It's a violation of the rules.

222
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,110
The organizing committee has decided to cancel the first place

223
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,350
of Zhu Yun and Gao Jianhong, who was in the same group as him in the previous session.

224
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,540
Li Xun, Zhu Yun, and Gao Jianhong are not allowed

225
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,840
to participate in competitions for the next three years.

226
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,830
That's all.

227
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Yes, why is this school so biased and has nothing?

228
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,030
Do you think it's our place?

229
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,130
I don't even want to come to this shitty place. A garbage university.

230
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,040
Yes. It's pretty bad.

231
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,850
What do you want to do?

232
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,900
Fang Zhijing, no matter where you go,

233
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,890
no matter what you try to do, you'll never make it.

234
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,100
I'll keep an eye on you...

235
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,480
until you have paid enough.

236
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,190
Old Gao.

237
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,580
Come to work in my company.

238
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,320
Let's work together.

239
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,910
Li Xun.

240
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,590
What do you think I am?

241
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,050
A dog that comes and goes at your beck and call?

242
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,240
You give me a slap and throw me a piece of meat,

243
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,150
so I should be grateful to you?

244
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,950
Sorry.

245
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,200
I asked around.

246
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,420
Fang Zhijing clearly said that

247
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,500
if you apologize to him in public, all of this would come to an end.

248
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,180
Why didn't you do as he said?

249
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,250
You promised that you wouldn't provoke him.

250
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,450
What happened today, is it what you wanted?

251
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,480
No.

252
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,380
- But I don't owe him. 
 - But you owe me.

253
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,750
I begged you. I begged you desperately.

254
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,960
Why didn't you lower your head once?

255
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,730
I know that you're capable, proud, and aloof.

256
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,420
Even now, you don't want to say that you're wrong.

257
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,440
You thought you lowered your head with a light-hearted apology.

258
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,180
I've tried my best.

259
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,560
Li Xun,

260
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,530
since I am...

261
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,020
inferior to you,

262
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,210
I can avoid you. Is that it?

263
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:22,100
But now you don't give me a chance to do that.

264
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,960
Are you satisfied...

265
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,040
to see me like this?

266
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,670
Old Gao,

267
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,490
for what I owe you today,

268
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,040
I'll pay you back twice.

269
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,040
I've always treat you as a friend.

270
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,560
If you don't mind,

271
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,440
we'll still be teammates.

272
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm sorry.

273
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,930
Strike! Strike!

274
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,960
Sweep, sweep, sweep!

275
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,580
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

276
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,700
Hurry! Rub, rub, rub!

277
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,920
It's almost.

278
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,700
You watch all kinds of sports matches.

279
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,450
In addition to all ball games, now you're watching curling.

280
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,820
Do you know its rules?

281
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,260
Yes.

282
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,520
The rules are the same. I know it as I see it.

283
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,050
Great.

284
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,550
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

285
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,280
- What-What are you doing? 
 - I want to watch the news.

286
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,900
 According to the "2016 White Paper on Talent Development" released today... 

287
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,560
Is this news?

288
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,850
They are just trivial matters.

289
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,770
 There are 5,954 talent support projects. 

290
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,140
 On average, more than 1,000 college students in the city start businesses and get employment every day. 

291
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
 Please see the details next. 

292
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,960
 Medical development has gone through many stages. 

293
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,010
 At this stage... 

294
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,480
Isn't that Yun?

295
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,100
 Take the road of intelligent medical treatment. 

296
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,170
Did you see her?

297
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,900
 With the development of the internet, big data, and cloud computing in the future... 

298
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,510
No. You're wrong.

299
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,190
 It's a general trend. 

300
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,570
The one in gray back there.

301
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,740
 Yes. 

302
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,910
Can't you recognize her?

303
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,240
You're back.

304
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,150
Old Gao is still angry.

305
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,240
I'll convince him step by step.

306
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,550
You should understand him.

307
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,400
He prepared for a year to apply for university.

308
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,000
It happened suddenly.

309
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,200
I see.

310
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,970
You've had a long day.

311
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,350
I'll try to convince him, too.

312
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,730
It's also a good choice to work with us.

313
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,130
 Very promising. It's all on the news. 

314
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,400
 The development of the internet, big data, and cloud computing... 

315
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,290
Oh no.

316
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,760
What's wrong?

317
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,210
I was captured on this news.

318
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,780
My mom must have seen me.

319
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,390
She is like big data detection.

320
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,300
No. I must go home to tell her the truth.

321
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,220
When will you leave?

322
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,950
Li Lan will come tomorrow.

323
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,140
I'll pick her up after sending you.

324
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,750
Why is she coming here?

325
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,320
It's dusty in the flower nursery.

326
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,180
She has a pterygium in her eye.

327
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,240
I asked her to come here to get an operation.

328
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,320
Shall I wait for her?

329
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,000
It doesn't matter. It's a minor operation.

330
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,200
I'll let you meet formally when she's fully recovered.

331
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,140
I have no other relatives.

332
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,340
What do you mean?

333
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,920
You knowingly ask.

334
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,140
Isn't this meeting the parents?  No substitutions.

335
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,680
No more substitutions.

336
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,910
Anyway, I can't find anyone better.

337
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,800
Princess.

338
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,600
I love you.

339
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,210
What did you say?

340
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,770
You hate parting with me?

341
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I'll come back in a few days.

342
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,880
Don't rush.

343
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,080
Spend more time with your parents.

344
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,530
Li Lan won't leave soon.

345
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,180
No.

346
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,430
   

347
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,860
We're back.

348
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,150
Mom, I'm back.

349
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,670
Welcome.

350
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,910
What will we have for dinner?

351
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,700
Wash your hands. We'll have dinner soon.

352
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh.

353
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,980
Mom, you made so many dishes.

354
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,280
Eat more.

355
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,200
Dad. Mom. I want to tell you something.

356
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, have dinner first,

357
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,380
and then we'll talk about it.

358
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,420
I gave up postgraduate studies.

359
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,820
I want to start a business.

360
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,450
No, I disagree.

361
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,010
Don't you want to ask me what I think? Don't you want to know?

362
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,660
I don't.

363
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
Prepare to go abroad from now on.

364
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,430
You've fallen a long way, you know?

365
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,600
You already know what Li Xun and I are doing?

366
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,410
Well. It's important. Why didn't you tell us earlier?

367
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,220
When were you going to tell us the truth?

368
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,250
Mom, he's not who you think he is.

369
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,680
What is he like?

370
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,350
There was a reason for his cheating back then. He needed money.

371
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,600
- He needed money. 
 - So he cheated?

372
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,000
In this case, he can kill and set fire to others for money?

373
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,960
Then why did they kill and set fire?

374
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,680
Also, what do you call them, these people?

375
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,600
When did you learn to talk back?

376
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,990
Calm down.

377
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,940
As the saying goes, "It's difficult for a poor family to bring forth a good son."

378
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,030
Actually, I don't agree with that.

379
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,800
A golden phoenix may fly out of a henhouse.

380
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,080
It depends on his fortune.

381
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,400
He can't get rid of his deep-rooted bad habits.

382
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,790
- He has no such habits. 
 - I know best whether he has such habits.

383
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,380
I've taught so many students.

384
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,000
People like him are extremely insecure inside.

385
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He'll try his best to make a difference when he has the chance.

386
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,430
- No. 
 - Why not?

387
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,560
You know why he pursued you?

388
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,350
He is trying to take revenge on me.

389
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,070
I pursued him.

390
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,870
Yun Yun, don't talk for him. Okay?

391
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,800
We know you best as your parents.

392
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,600
And you saw what he did in the competition.

393
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,740
Dad, you know he took part in the competition for me.

394
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,980
You're an easy target for such people.

395
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,720
When can you be alert like a grown-up?

396
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,100
But Fang Zhijing broke the competition rules. It was unfair to the other groups.

397
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,950
Is it up to you whether it's fair or not?

398
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,400
Even if it's really unfair to take a step back, you should file a complaint according to the procedure.

399
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,300
But you broke competition rules before reporting to teachers and school.

400
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,380
You deserve to be disqualified.

401
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,930
Look.

402
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,190
You are being used by this person.

403
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,690
You're quarreling with us.

404
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,240
You don't notice that, right?

405
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,120
You're so naive.

406
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,040
Too childish.

407
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,540
- Come back. I haven't finished yet. 
 - Yun.

408
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,940
Where are you going?

409
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,350
What the hell is wrong with you child?

410
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,210
Why are you so rebellious now?

411
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,690
You can do all the small things you like. I don't care.

412
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,720
But this is a big choice in life.

413
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,370
You have to do what we say.

414
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,490
You know what. Youth is the most precious thing in our life, especially to girls.

415
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:32,100
But now you choose to start a business with others instead of further studying.

416
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,690
You won't have more choices in the future.

417
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,300
The bastard will confine you in one place.

418
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,620
Calm down.

419
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,100
Yun, we're reasonable.

420
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,400
No matter what you want to do, let's have a good talk first.

421
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,620
I have nothing to talk about with you.

422
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,560
Put your luggage down.

423
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
Is he more important than us?

424
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,740
What if I say yes?

425
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,490
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

426
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,700
Reflect on yourself.

427
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,770
What's wrong, Sis?

428
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,320
Nothing.

429
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,150
I caught a cold.

430
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,670
Don't worry.

431
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Here is the menu. Order what you like.

432
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,810
I...

433
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,590
Order a bowl of noodles for me.

434
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,880
Okay.

435
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,740
Whether you eat or not, it costs 258 yuan per person.

436
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,560
That expensive?

437
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,550
Then, let's dine somewhere else. No need.

438
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,210
Waiter.

439
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,330
Waiter. An a la carte order.

440
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,740
You ordered too many dishes.

441
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,530
It's worth it.

442
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,840
Enjoy it.

443
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,210
Well...

444
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,630
The flowers have been selling well recently.

445
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,050
Really?

446
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,970
Here you are.

447
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,670
Brother, don't give me money again.

448
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,900
I kept all the money you gave me.

449
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,530
I can pay for my treatment.

450
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,600
Then, why didn't you see a doctor earlier before I forced you?

451
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,710
You have extra money?

452
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,200
Did Zhang Dagang stop drinking?

453
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,740
Sis,

454
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,890
you can divorce.

455
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,950
I'll take care of An'an.

456
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,900
Zhang Dagang can't teach him.

457
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,870
We know that clearly.

458
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,350
Sis,

459
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,090
even if you can bear it,

460
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,020
you need to think about An'an.

461
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,820
He'll study in my city.

462
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,040
Okay.

463
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,770
Take the treatment first.

464
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,620
We'll talk about it later.

465
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,470
Don't worry.

466
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,320
I'll be there with you.

467
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,180
I'll arrange it.

468
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,400
Okay.

469
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,610
Brother, you seem to have changed.

470
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,140
Really?

471
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,520
How?

472
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,320
You seem to know...

473
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,910
how-how to love others.

474
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,830
You know what, I've reserved a room in a hotel for you for a week.

475
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,500
I want you to spend more time here.

476
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,700
No need.

477
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,730
I'll go back after the operation.

478
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,020
Ten days after the operation, you have to go back to remove the stitches.

479
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,660
And I want you to meet someone.

480
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,750
Who?

481
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,450
She should be your acquaintance.

482
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,850
You'll know when you see her.

483
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,790
Okay. I'll leave it to you.

484
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,020
Okay. I'll arrange it.

485
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,790
Okay.

486
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,220
Enjoy the food. Don't look at me.

487
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,310
Gao Jianhong, let's talk.

488
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,770
I've been waiting for you all night. Let's talk.

489
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,870
I have nothing to say to you.

490
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,480
Well, think about it. We're trapped by Li Xun.

491
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,470
He won't let me go now.

492
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,930
Not only your future but mine was ruined by too.

493
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,140
We're on the same boat.

494
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,280
Who's on the same boat as you?

495
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,640
It's your own skills that are inferior to his.

496
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,870
Okay.

497
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,210
I have a chance to manage and train some new students.

498
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,850
I'm on good terms with several investors, I can recommend you.

499
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,980
You also know that they're from big companies.

500
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,460
Help me to persuade Li Xun to let me go.

501
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,800
Let's give in on both sides.

502
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,500
Get out.

503
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,020
Gao Jianhong,

504
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,840
are you out of your mind?

505
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,020
What have you got by working with Li Xun?

506
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,880
He stole your thunder in the competition and made you miss the offer.

507
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,120
Even your favorite girl likes him.

508
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,100
Fang Zhijing, listen.

509
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,080
Li Xun and I are brothers. He is ten thousand times better than you.

510
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,630
I'm willing to work with him.

511
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:40,200
And he'll keep an eye on you as he said.

512
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,870
I don't need to waste my time.

513
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,000
But for his sister coming here, he won't let you go.

514
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,540
When she leaves, he'll try many ways to make you suffer.

515
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,760
It's almost the final.

516
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,010
Be careful, or you'll fail again.

517
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,870
Please fill out the form.

518
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,710
Please keep your room card.

519
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,310
Thank you.

520
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,020
It hurts?

521
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,610
No.

522
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,540
Li Xun, can we cancel the reservation? It's too expensive.

523
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,170
I paid the money.

524
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,660
It's wasteful.

525
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,010
If you think so, remember to go downstairs for breakfast tomorrow morning.

526
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,820
- But... 
 - Fine.

527
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,720
Just get some good rest.

528
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,100
I'll do something tomorrow afternoon and pick you up for dinner.

529
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,500
- No need. 
 - Okay.

530
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,050
Here you are.

531
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,220
- Go. 
 - Get back to your business.

532
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,700
What would you like for dinner?

533
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,090
- Leave me alone. 
 - What would you like?

534
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,030
Hello. Please show me your breakfast coupon.

535
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,290
Waiter.

536
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,300
- Coming. 
 - Excuse me.

537
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,700
Is there hot water?

538
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,170
Yes. Over there.

539
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,450
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

540
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:53,020
Could you please hurry up?

541
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,620
I'll help you.

542
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,870
- Thanks. 
 - Not at all.

543
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,720
Here you are.

544
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,510
Thanks.

545
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,550
Hello. Are you Li Xun's sister?

546
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,830
Hi, I'm Li Xun's friend. My name is Fang Zhijing.

547
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,500
I'm here for a competition.

548
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,590
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

549
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,700
This is for you.

550
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,830
- Thank you so much. 
 - Never mind.

551
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,140
Thanks.

552
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,340
You took some medicine. Have some porridge to warm up.

553
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,810
Thanks.

554
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,000
Take your time.

555
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,660
This breakfast is very expensive. It's 128 yuan for each person.

556
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:52,600
It's so expensive.

557
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,530
It costs more than 500 yuan staying here one night. I stay here just because it's near the venue.

558
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:05,680
Young man, can I cancel the reservation?

559
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,800
Of course. I'm also looking for a cheaper hotel.

560
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,870
Do you know where there is a cheaper one?

561
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:24,910


562
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,570
   

563
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,570
 Hello, Old Gao. What's wrong? 

564
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,520
 Where are you? Something happened. 

565
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,900
 - Yun, where are you going? 
 - Zhu Yun, 

566
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,550
 Fang Zhijing is a bastard. 

567
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,050
 He swindled Li Lan away to scare you. 

568
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,540
 He left early in the morning after giving statements. 

569
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,820
 We know he did it, but we can do nothing. 

570
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,610
 Li Lan is gone. You're the only one I've got. 

571
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,260
 Let's go to meet your parents. 

572
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,990
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

573
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,050
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

574
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:05,750
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

575
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,470
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

576

♫  We will not separate  ♫

578

♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

579
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,550
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

580
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,590
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

581
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:42,550
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

582
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:50,230
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

583

♫  True love will take its course  ♫

00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,030
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

587

♫  True love will take its course  ♫

588

♫  That hot firework  ♫

589
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:27,270
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

590
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,430
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

591
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,250
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

592

595

♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

596
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,870
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

597
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,470
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

598
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:19,030
