00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,716
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,740
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,340
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,536
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,884
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,980
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,930
   

22
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,300
 Lina, we have arrived. Are you at school? 

23
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,250
Old Gao.

24
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,230
This is for you.

25
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,066
You bought it?

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,260
Last time you treated me to dinner, so just take it as a return gift.

27
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,380
You are so polite. Thank you.

28
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,390
I don't understand. I chose one that I thought was good.

29
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,900
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes.

30
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,030
Don't you want to open it?

31
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,230
I like everything you give me.

32
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,810
Okay.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,470
Old Gao, only you came?

34
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,241
Where's Li Xun? Has he come yet?

35
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:09,470
Yes.

36
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,110
Where is he?

37
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,454
In the room.

38
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:17,230
We changed our project as he said. I was just looking for him.

39
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,420
Let's go upstairs.

40
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,512
He's sleeping.

41
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:22,732
He sleeps at this point?

42
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:24,930
Is he an old man?

43
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,910
He's been irritated recently. Don't bother him.

44
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,680
He scolds people mercilessly.

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,480
Really?

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,130
Fine. Then I'll go shopping.

47
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,950
Let me go with you.

48
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,056
I'm free and want to take a walk.

49
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,660
All right.

50
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,874
This is so cute.

51
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:49,468
Yeah.

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,608
This Macchiato is too sweet. I'll get fat.

53
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,140
Then give it to me. I'll buy you a new one later.

54
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,191
This. Thank you for coming.

55
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,240
Welcome to the comprehensive oral care brand.

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,476
May I help you?

57
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,560
I want to buy a toothbrush for my friend.

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,450
- Would you recommend some? 
 - Okay.

59
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,430
Then you can take this marble electric toothbrush. It sells well.

60
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,630
- It can clean teeth effectively. 
 - Really?

61
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,917
There are twelve modes for you to adjust the intensity by yourself.

62
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,380
Is this for lovers?

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,944
Yes, it's for lovers.

64
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,290
It's pretty. Then I'd like to take a pair.

65
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay. Will that be cash or charge?

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,240
Cash.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
- Okay. 
 - Wait.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,140
I'll buy it myself.  Card.

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,270
Okay.

70
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,210
You are back.

71
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,910
Yeah.

72
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,730
I bought some fruit. Have a bite.

73
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,130
Okay.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,190
How was the discussion today?

75
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,610
- Pretty good. 
 - That's good.

76
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,131
Why did you come back so late?

77
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,580
 I was stopped on my way back. 

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,330
 Go for the competition. 

79
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,870
   
 You are always No.1 in my heart. 

80
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,170
   
 You smile every day. 

81
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,218
 Xu Lina. 

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,330
Let's go to the restaurant we ordered from last night.

83
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,210
Several groups eat together.

84
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,350
- How many of you are there? 
 - Zhu Yun?

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,336
You go first.

86
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:04,830
Bye-bye.

87
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,710
I remember when you graduated from high school,  you changed your phone number?

88
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,261
It suddenly occurred to me that I forgot to ask for your mobile number the last time I saw you.

89
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,290
You also came to the competition?

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,380
The last time I asked you, you didn't tell me.

91
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,190
I didn't see your name on the list.

92
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,001
Come on. Does you need to hide so deeply?

93
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,310
I'll have a group meeting later.

94
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,520
It'll end at about 7:00. Then let's have a meal.

95
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,860
No thanks.

96
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,190
We are old classmates. I haven't seen you for so long.

97
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,390
How about having a meal and talking about the past?

98
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,780
Our group has an appointment to have dinner together.

99
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,346
Is Li Xun also coming?

100
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,990
Of course.

101
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,330
You can keep your own trump deep.

102
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,178
I really want to see how capable he is.

103
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
Then I'll go first. I'll be late.

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,140
Wait. Tell me your phone number. Let me make a note.

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,900
I didn't bring my cell phone with me. I can't remember the number.

106
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,130
That's amazing. Next time.

107
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,990
Bye, old schoolmate.

108
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,790
Have you submitted it?

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,810
Deadline is 12:00. It's 11:40 now.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,640
What are you doing?

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,620
Click submit.

112
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,190
Test it again?

113
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,720
No need. You've packed it.

114
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,950
Test it again.

115
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,070
How many times have you tested it?

116
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,030
What if there is a problem with this platform?

117
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,850
There are only three competition platforms.

118
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,770
Windows, Linux, and Unix.

119
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,900
Even pupils won't make any mistakes.

120
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,996
But I'm afraid.

121
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,888
   

122
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,770
Isn't it over?

123
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,370
That's it?

124
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
What a rabbit.

125
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,500
- Hello. Hello. Hello. 
 - Here.

126
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,800
Okay.

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,170
Hello. Hello.

128
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,741
I'm so sorry.

129
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,650
It doesn't matter. I just arrived.

130
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,880
Is that so? Well, I'd like to leave for a while.

131
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,870
Order me a macchiato.

132
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,790
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

133
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,410
Waiter.

134
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,771
- Hello. 
 - A macchiato, not too sweet.

135
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay.

136
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,960
Thank you, Brother Feng.

137
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,120
How is it? Isn't this a good place?

138
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,530
You should have avoided suspicion at this time.

139
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,770
But you asked me out alone.

140
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,600
I've invited you to such a far place.

141
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,650
- It has avoided suspicion enough. 
  - Fang Zhijing. 

142
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,900
What on earth happened?

143
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,720
 Isn't that the sponsor of the competition? 

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,170
Brother Feng, I heard that Nanhu University has recently had a pretty good project.

145
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,236
The judges loved it.

146
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:45,130
You heard about it?

147
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,530
Have you seen their project? How did you like it?

148
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,110
What's wrong? Are you scared?

149
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,340
Scared? Not at all.

150
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,336
Anyway, you can't be more careful.

151
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,790
By the way, Brother Feng, can you discuss this with Mr. Chen

152
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,770
and ask him to apply for a star prize with the organizing committee?

153
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,296
There is no such award. It won't work.

154
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,940
Brother Feng, listen to me first.

155
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,900
Think about it. Haven't we made an agreement?

156
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,910
The contract is ready, waiting only for the signature.

157
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,441
Mr. Chen also needs to enhance his performance this year. Right?

158
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:30,732
If something goes wrong here, the company must treat him as a joke.

159
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,584
How should I persuade Mr. Chen?

160
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,470
How about this? I can give in three more percent in the patent transfer fee.

161
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,090
Brother Feng, later, for the annual patent transfer fee, you will take 30% and me, 70%.

162
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,450
Okay. I'll give it a try.

163
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,310
Great. Thank you, Brother Feng.

164
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,000
I have a meeting this afternoon. I have to go.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,550
Let me walk you out.

166
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,910
Wait, Brother Feng, take an umbrella.

167
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,810
 Thank you for that. 

168
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,206
 Discuss it with Mr. Chen. 

169
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,076
Fang Zhijing?

170
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,720
Isn't that person beside Fang Zhijing from our competition's sponsor?

171
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,910
You know him?

172
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,290
He was also present at the forum.

173
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,946
What is Fang Zhijing doing with him?

174
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,690
What are you up to?

175
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,770
He must be trying to do something.

176
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,970
During the competition, meeting with sponsors privately is against the rules.

177
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,840
Don't be so impulsive.

178
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,340
I'm going to report them to the organizing committee.

179
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,720
Do you have any evidence?

180
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,050
We saw it with our own eyes.

181
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,440
So what?

182
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,704
Did you hear what they said?

183
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,360
It's against the rules to meet privately.

184
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,120
But at most, they will get a notice of criticism.

185
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,720
Can it help?

186
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,560
What a coincidence. We even came across him.

187
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,550
I didn't expect Fang Zhijing to make such a move.

188
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,650
What happened to Fang Zhijing?

189
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,500
When we had coffee this afternoon, we met Fang Zhijing.

190
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,660
I've never met any mean person like him.

191
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,220
We saw him with someone from the organizing committee.

192
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,320
What happened?

193
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,490
Sorry. I'll answer the phone first.

194
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,020
The competition will start soon.

195
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,740
He met the sponsor in secret at a far away place.

196
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,170
They wouldn't have a normal chat only.

197
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,220
I think they are simply negotiating to directly decide the award-winning final winner.

198
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,900
They have determined the result of the finals?

199
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,070
What finals? They are cheating fools like us.

200
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,220
- Why is it so cold? 
 - Has the taxi arrived?

201
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,750
Not yet, but soon.

202
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,630
What would you like for dinner?

203
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,930
Some people are really mean.

204
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,642
They can do anything for an award.

205
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,620
Being able to sell patents are a kind of ability.

206
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,620
Instead of gossiping here,

207
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,736
some people would be better to go back and improve their level.

208
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:31,380
What level should I improve?

209
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,980
The level of playing tricks and pulling strings?

210
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,530
What bullshit are you talking about?

211
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,450
Whether it's bullshit is clear to everyone.

212
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,750
Xu Lina,

213
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,350
what right do you have to slander me about "playing tricks and pulling strings"?

214
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,050
You are just a gifted student of folk dance

215
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,590
who got in by adding points.

216
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,058
Aren't you clear about your programming level?

217
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,220
Have you no shame to say this?

218
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,930
Make it clear.

219
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,980
You are clearer than me about how many people you asked for help

220
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,460
to make your shabby system.

221
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,340
You alone will never be able to enter the finals in your life.

222
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,488
But I've improved it at least three times.

223
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,560
Right, Li Xun?

224
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,980
Miss Xu.

225
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,960
Next time, before you criticize someone,

226
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,390
consider whether you have this ability first.

227
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,190
You.

228
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,896
Here, let's go.

229
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,290
How can there be such a person?

230
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,440
Fang Zhijing.

231
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,754
Is what Xu Lina said true?

232
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:00,210
Zhu Yun, why are you so naive now?

233
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,870
Can you ask this directly?

234
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,358
I asked you if it was true.

235
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,070
You participate in this competition

236
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,830
because you really want to compete with me?

237
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,170
What a pity.

238
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,520
I'd love to compete with your God Li.

239
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,630
But there's no chance.

240
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,630
Maybe next time.

241
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,924
It's all cut and dried.

242
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,520
You are so scared about Li Xun attending?

243
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,840
You're using such unscrupulous means.

244
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,160
The judges think my stuff is good. So is it called means?

245
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,400
People like Xu Lina only play tricks. You saw it too.

246
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,980
They have their resources.

247
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,928
I have my way.

248
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,652
Don't just say anyone.

249
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:53,006
And I don't even care.

250
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,936
Do you know the essential difference between them and me?

251
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,360
They can choose to talk nonsense or not.

252
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,452
I can also choose to listen or not.

253
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:09,550
But whether they talk nonsense or not, my result will not be changed.

254
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,690
If I choose to listen, at most, I will be annoyed for a while.

255
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,380
If I choose not to listen,

256
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,480
then I'm the winner.

257
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,714
You're so smart.

258
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:23,422
You should understand who is better.

259
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:28,026
In this world, heroes are always judged by success.

260
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:32,580
People always worship the strong.

261
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,100
Believe it or not.

262
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,312
As long as I keep succeeding,

263
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:42,134
everyone will forget today's criticism

264
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:46,410
and become my fanatical followers and admirers.

265
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,260
Okay, I'm done.

266
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,960
I have to go.

267
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,950
Are you okay?

268
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,488
I'm fine.

269
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,562
I squeezed so much time out,

270
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,608
not to see you like this.

271
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,632
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,394
Do you hate Fang Zhijing?

273
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,910
I see.

274
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,250
Aren't you going to ask why?

275
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,850
No.

276
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,520
What if the reason doesn't convince you?

277
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,450
It doesn't matter if there's no reason.

278
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,370
Everyone can make decisions based on their emotions.

279
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,024
Do you have a way?

280
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,510
No.

281
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,546
Do not overdo it.

282
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,420
Some things have no result originally.

283
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,554
To stop loss in time,

284
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,864
waste less time.

285
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,880
I'm tired. You can leave.

286
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,792
 Hello. 

287
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,040
 How are you feeling now? Are you nervous? 

288
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,590
 Let me tell you. 

289
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,900
 On the day of the competition, 

290
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,450
 the group leader will go to the stage to explain first 

291
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,638
and the judges will score on the spot.

292
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:45,158
You have only ten minutes to explain.

293
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:48,264
 Then it's the work demonstration. 

294
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:50,170
 Zhu Yun. 

295
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,870
Class rep.

296
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,920
Mr. Lin.

297
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,240
 I mean, you need to demonstrate it first. 

298
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,800
 In a short time, show clearly the work's creativity, technology roadmap, and application prospect  

299
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,930
to the judges and audience.

300
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,200
This is important.

301
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,590
Got it?

302
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,990
 Yeah. 

303
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,960
Mr. Li,

304
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,890
that USB encryption project of the Information Technology University will be awarded anyway?

305
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,310
Miss Zhang told me about this. I also inquired about it indirectly.

306
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,912
There is definitely a rumor

307
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:30,710
saying that a star prize will be set up.

308
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,210
 Don't think so much about it. This is beyond our control. 

309
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,490
 Just mind your business. 

310
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,542
 We learn for ourselves, right? 

311
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,090
I see.

312
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,050
 I have other lessons. I'm waiting for your good news. 

313
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,781
 - Bye-bye.  
 - All right, goodbye, Mr. Lin.

314
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:48,506
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

315
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,480
Didn't you listen to Mr. Lin?

316
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,900
They gave them a star prize.

317
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,750
This is good for us.

318
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,680
The biggest competitor is left.

319
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,410
It will do us no harm.

320
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,350
We have a better chance.

321
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,100
No chance.

322
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,550
He will still stand on the stage like a success,

323
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,554
saying those acceptance speeches proudly.

324
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,854
No one knows how dirty he is.

325
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,144
No one can tear off his hypocritical mask either.

326
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,830
In this world, there is no absolute fairness.

327
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,160
Moreover, there are countless roads to victory.

328
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,500
Even if one way is blocked by you,

329
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,330
there are still countless ways for him to take.

330
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,440
Where's Li Xun? Where is he?

331
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,030
He hasn't been back for days.

332
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,900
He didn't answer any calls or WeChat massages.

333
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,140
I can't tell if he came for the competition or travel.

334
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,070
I'm tired. I'd like to go back to get some rest.

335
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,880
 By the way, Brother Feng, can you discuss this with Mr. Chen and ask him to apply for a star prize with the organizing committee? 

336
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,550
Do you really think no one can defeat you?

337
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,350
Li Xun,

338
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,340
even if you block one of his ways,

339
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,700
there are countless other ways he can take.

340
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,240
   

341
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,684
   

342
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,970
Do you really think you can do anything?

343
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,160
   

344
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,680
   

345
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,688
I think we have no problem.

346
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,270
Princess, have a look again.

347
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,900
Stop that. Where's Li Xun?

348
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,700
I don't know.

349
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,200
Congratulations.

350
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,680
You know what?

351
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,020
You won the first prize this time.

352
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,870
- Really? 
 - And what about you?

353
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,540
I can't compete with you.

354
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,068
I got a star prize.

355
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:32,030
You don't even have a chance to compete with me.

356
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,082
Are you disappointed?

357
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,111
Where's Li Xun? He is absent again?

358
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,800
He's busy.

359
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,790
He is really mysterious.

360
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,370
He doesn't leave any chance for others to worship him.

361
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,230
You can get this result in your freshman year. That's great.

362
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,090
Let's have a chat later.

363
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,470
Bye.

364
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,958
He is really bold-faced.

365
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,060
 Next, we are going to issue the first prize in this competition. 

366
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,510
 Nanhu University. LAN ARP Protocol Attack Defense System Based on Switch. 

367
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,466
 Winners are Gao Jianhong, Zhu Yun, and Li Xun. 

368
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,900
- Let's go together. 
 - You go.

369
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,890
Thank you.

370
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,410
 Great! 

371
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:39,170
 Next is our most important link. 

372
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,870
 We have a work that stood out at the competition stage 

373
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,070
 and got the opportunity to sign the contract in advance. 

374
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,910
 The purpose of this competition is to promote exchange and cooperation 

375
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,210
 between enterprises and universities. 

376
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,310
 This work has taken the first step for us. 

377
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,534
 So we set up a star prize. 

378
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,250
 The winner is the Information Technology University's 

379
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,690
 USB intelligent encryption interface. 

380
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,742
 Participants are Fang Zhijing, Wang Yujun, and Zhang Shuo. 

381
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,768
 Well, we also invite the sponsor of this competition, 

382
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:28,830
 leader of Huake Technology Co., Ltd to present the award to them on stage. 

383
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,290
Thank you.

384
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,270
I'll call Mr. Lin.

385
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,730
- Yes, sure.

386
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,430
Hello, everyone.

387
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,372
I'm Fang Zhijing.

388
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,342
Right here.

389
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:49,880
First of all, I would like to thank the organizing committee for giving us this star prize.

390
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,900
Secondly, I want to thank all of you here.

391
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,160
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you.

392
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,298
 Get down! 

393
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:05,876
I know there have been a lot of rumors in the school recently,

394
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:09,690
saying that I cheated or I stole another's work.

395
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,970
Originally, a clean hand wants no washing.

396
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,106
As I have never done it, I don't need to explain too much.

397
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,650
But for the rest of my team, this is quite unfair.

398
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:24,274
So right here, I solemnly clarify to everyone that, I, Fang Zhijing,

399
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:27,850
have never done anything that violated the rules of the competition.

400
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,860
Those irresponsible remarks, slander, or false accusations,

401
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,300
will damage the reputation of this information contest,

402
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,620
and a great insult to the fairness and impartiality of this contest.

403
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,660
It's an insult to the fairness of the competition...

404
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,150
that you can win a star prize for this shabby project.

405
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,756
Is it Li Xun?

406
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,710
Who is this?

407
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,650
Li Xun.

408
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,450
What's up?

409
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,650
You have been disappearing for days.

410
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,710
Where have you been these days?

411
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,440
I went to do something bad.

412
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,720
What do you mean?

413
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Well, I mean,

414
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,620
your so-called encryption interface is totally vulnerable...

415
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,680
and doesn't deserve this prize.

416
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,910
Li Xun, you should be responsible for your remarks.

417
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,480
Am I afraid of responsibility or are you afraid of responsibility?

418
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,510
Yeah. Are you afraid of responsibility?

419
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,626
 Yeah. Yeah. 

420
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:03,040
 You are afraid? 

421
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,532
 You are afraid? 

422
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:10,680
 Afraid? 

423
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,180
Okay.

424
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,540
If he can crack my encrypted USB disk,

425
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,944
I can give up this patent transfer fee to him.

426
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,558
But if...

427
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,554
you can't break it,

428
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,840
you...

429
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,306
need to apologize to me.

430
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,990
Okay.

431
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,458
It's a deal.

432
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,750
For the sake of fairness, I'd better use the computer of the organizing committee.

433
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,226
Help yourself.

434
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,560
This competition will be wonderful.

435
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,690
I have confidence in Fang Zhijing.

436
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,420
   

437
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,000
What are they doing?

438
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,040
Li Xun is cracking Fang Zhijing's encryption USB disk.

439
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,340
I've seen your plan introduction. Good concept.

440
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,620
Of course.

441
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,970
Or I couldn't take it.

442
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,918
Within a minute, I have three ways to crack it.

443
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,900
Okay.

444
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,480
This USB disk contains my personal privacy.

445
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,300
If he can crack it, I'll show it to you all.

446
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,150
- Are you sure? 
 - I'm sure.

447
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,600
Go ahead.

448
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,170
You're very considerate.

449
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,960
To prevent forgetting the password, while the USB disk is encrypted,

450
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,720
usually a key is generated.

451
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,120
Indeed.

452
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,896
Our patent considers that many people forget their passwords.

453
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,410
But you are not skilled enough.

454
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,010
What is generated is a local static key.

455
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,720
This key can be found as long as your computer is hacked.

456
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,780
The letter "e" here represents the drive letter to be unlocked.

457
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,250
This is the local static key you saved.

458
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,430
 Great. 

459
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,870
Let me see.

460
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,932
There's no privacy.

461
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,220
You hid them all?

462
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,012
 Oh my god. 

463
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,206
 His girlfriend is there. 

464
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,372
You didn't hide such private things well?

465
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,306
From the source of the document, you have another WeChat account.

466
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:22,500
Does your girlfriend know about it?

467
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,750
 That's not good. 

468
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,650
   

469
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,530
It's not over yet.

470
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,820
Do you want to see it?

471
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,544
 Yes. 

472
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,420
Let's continue.

473
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,750
The second way.

474
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,920
Empty disk copying.

475
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,300
Now, I am about to use Ghost to copy the disk.

476
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,920
But I have to say your encryption software is quite secure.

477
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,650
Even in DOS, it also prohibits the use of Ghost.

478
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,300
Once Ghost is activated, the USB disk will pop up automatically.

479
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,450
   

480
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,418
Even if you plug it back in, it cannot be seen in Ghost.

481
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,170
Therefore, I used DiskGenius,

482
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,380
software for direct operation of the hard disk.

483
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,810
Insert two USB drives to copy directly and decrypt successfully.

484
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,010
Because this encryption software is associated with the serial number of the USB disk,

485
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,234
if it enters a new USB disk, the file will be automatically released.

486
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,820
   

487
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
 Great! 

488
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,854
You can't delete the file cleanly.

489
00:32:51,854 --> 00:32:54,350
You need to improve your safety awareness.

490
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,580
You don't deserve the star prize in the Information Security Network Competition.

491
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,300
Well done, Li Xun!

492
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,292
So cool!

493
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,320
 Great! Well done! 

494
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,550
This is too outrageous.

495
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,480
Chairman Peng, you can't let him do this anymore.

496
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,870
Don't worry.

497
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,704
Isn't he testing your product?

498
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,780
This is not in accordance with the rules of the competition.

499
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,264
It's not appropriate here.

500
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:40,346
I'll ask you again later.

501
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,530
You just leave in this way?

502
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,758
If you run away, your patent can't be sold.

503
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,100
Here is a chance for you. Put a patch.

504
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,892
   

505
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,758
Only five seconds left.

506
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,700
Li Xun, there are only five seconds left.

507
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,410
Can you?

508
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,380
Let's get started.

509
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,921
Li Xun! There are three seconds left.

510
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,510
Chairman Peng, look at him.

511
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,300
What do you mean? You can't afford to play?

512
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,100
Who can't afford to play?

513
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,740
You can't afford to play?

514
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,000
Look at him.

515
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,408
He can't afford to play.

516
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,780
How is it?

517
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,380
Admit failure?

518
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,970
Do you still need me to explain this to you?

519
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,132
The third method is the physical method.

520
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,220
As long as the flash granule or the main control chip is replaced,

521
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,050
the original software encryption will be automatically invalidated.

522
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,202
I don't need to explain such a simple truth to you, right?

523
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,330
Sorry. I just delayed you a minute.

524
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,404
But then, I have to delay you for a bit longer.

525
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,520
This is the surveillance video of last Saturday afternoon from a cafe on Nanchang Road.

526
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,684
What does that mean?

527
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:58,400
Tian Feng is really my senior. I admit we should avoid suspicion before the competition.

528
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,810
But I haven't seen him for a long time. We just met and had coffee.

529
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,360
What's wrong?

530
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,540
Any problems? Any problems?

531
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,820
Really?

532
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,050
 By the way, Brother Feng, can you discuss this with Mr. Chen 

533
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,960
 and ask him to apply for a star prize with the organizing committee? 

534
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,170
 Think about it. Haven't we made an agreement? 

535
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,510
 This is the cafe I went to that day. The day I saw him. 

536
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,610
 Mr. Chen also needs to enhance his performance this year. Right? 

537
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,170
 If something goes wrong in the end, the company must treat him as a joke. 

538
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,252
 How should I persuade Mr. Chen? 

539
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:37,180
 How about this? I can give in three more percent in the patent transfer fee. 

540
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,550
 Later, for the annual patent transfer fee, you will take 30% and me, 70%. 

541
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,790
 Okay. I'll give it a try. 

542
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,164
Look what you've done?

543
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,890
Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen!

544
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,850
Mr. Chen, listen to me.

545
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,790
Li Xun, I'll remember you.

546
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,762
This student, I feel like you're kind of breaching the rules of the competition.

547
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:23,876
This will also affect your performance.

548
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,460
I see.

549
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,250
Then can you tell me why you did this?

550
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,440
Because of love.

551
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,436
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

552
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,260
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

553
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,180
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

554
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,860
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

555
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,800
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

556
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,930
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

557
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,470
Li Xun, I love you! You are so cool!

558
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,330
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

559
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,520
♫  Wherever I go, I just want to wander with you  ♫

560
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,660
♫  My princess will never be sad again  ♫

561
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,180
♫  If I am the king  ♫

562
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,980
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

563
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,700
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

564
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,852
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

565
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,822
You beat us, the jury's face today.

566
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,010
That's good.

567
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,710
You finally supervised the fairness and justice of our competition.

568
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,790
We will revoke this star prize.

569
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,420
But you have to be punished.

570
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,350
I know.

571
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,880
By the way, I have a project in Sanya this summer vacation.

572
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,100
It's still a secret stage.

573
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,190
Would you like to go with me?

574
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,890
Let me think it over.

575
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,920
You are putting on airs.

576
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,292
All right, see you later.

577
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,510
Let's go.

578
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,430
Fang Zhijing,

579
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,250
in fact, you are smart in some ways.

580
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,020
Some of your ideas are also correct.

581
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,860
In this world, it's true to judge heroes by success.

582
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,830
But it's a pity.

583
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,242
You got the end time wrong.

584
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,550
There's still a long way to go.

585
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,922
It is not over yet.

586
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,620
Okay.

587
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,460
I'm waiting for it.

588
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,570
Let's go.

589
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,816
Are you happy?

590
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,532
Then give me a smile.

591
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,060
Silly girl.

592
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,660
Are you so happy?

593
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,460
Yeah. I've never been so happy.

594
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,730
That's good.

595
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,252
Otherwise, I would lose a lot.

596
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:47,060
Where did you go the other day?

597
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:52,220
Did you really think I could decode Fang Zhijing's encrypted USB within one minute?

598
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,490
I've been working for several days. I'm so exhausted.

599
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,886
Li Xun.

600
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,110
What kind of person do you think can be called a princess?

601
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,230
Princess.

602
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,460
First,

603
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,470
must have a pair of lofty eyes.

604
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:38,186
In addition, she must have an innocent and fragile heart.

605
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,630
Yes, of course.

606
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:48,051
If she has dash of risk-taking adventure,

607
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:49,730
that would be better.

608
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:21,210


609
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,550
   

610
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,610
 You think he and I... 

611
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,510
 Perfect match. 

612
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,510
 Slow down. 

613
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,280
 Li Xun. 

614
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,270
 I want to start a business with you, starting from L&amp;P. 

615
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,070
 Do whatever you want. 

616
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,630
 I'm your confidence. 

617
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,800
 Xun! 

618
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,170
 I came to see you. 

619
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:46,522
 Why are you here? 

620
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:50,332
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

621
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,320
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

622
