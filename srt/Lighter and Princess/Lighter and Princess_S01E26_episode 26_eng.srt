1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,700
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,660
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,140
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,700
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,920
   

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,210
Unexpectedly, this store is still open here.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,150
I know just a few stores.

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,810
Yes. Back then you seldom took me to restaurants like this.

25
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,590
That was a favor to you.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,170
You remember it very clearly.

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,270
What is this?

28
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,800
Chronology of events.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
You didn't have time, right?

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,450
How long did it take you to write this?

31
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,350
What you wrote is just ordinary.

32
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,910
They are historical events accessible to all.

33
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,600
But this kind of game needs a sense of curiosity.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,430
It requires more details.

35
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,970
I've compiled several e-books and posts on forums,

36
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,610
including some unofficial history records.

37
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,870
Unofficial history?

38
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,300
Those are my favorites.

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,880
I made it for you to study,

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,840
not for your curiosity.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,510
You don't usually play games.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,720
The last time I played a game is...

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,650
Are telling me the last game you played was the one I designed for you?

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,580
 A game? 

45
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,720
 Three chances. 

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,040
 If you make it, I'll attend the morning self-study. 

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,580
   

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,680
I also found several games similar to Invincible Generals.

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,600
The installation package is on the flash drive.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,420
Tomorrow is the weekend. Don't go to the company.

51
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,140
Take time to play and feel it.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,450
You stood up on impulsion.

53
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,560
Think about your capability before doing that.

54
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,540
Can't you say something nice?

55
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,260
So are you going to fight with Gao Jianhong?

56
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,190
Yes.

57
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,900
Invincible General will be our first bullet.

58
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,460
Be serious.

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,820
I see.

60
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,720
Boss!

61
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,590
I'll have a bottle of Erguotou.

62
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,890
Wait.

63
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,950
- Are you going to drink? 
  Yes. I want to celebrate.

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
- Okay. 
 - Wait.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,450
We don't need alcohol.

66
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,020
Why? Mind your own business.

67
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,270
Don't drink.

68
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,840
None of your business.

69
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,150
Don't serve the alcohol. I won't pay for it.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,990
I will. Serve it.

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Well. Excuse me.

72
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,100
Who should I listen to?

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,600
Me.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,410
I'm the group leader.

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,630
Serve it, Boss. Thanks.

76
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,360
Can't I celebrate?

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,040
You don't need to walk me back.

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,860
I'm not drunk.

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,420
When I was abroad...

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,770
You learned to drink abroad.

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,860
It has nothing to do with that.

82
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,080
You misguided me.

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,510
I learned to drink from you.

84
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,250
I drank for the first time.

85
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,750
I played games for the first time.

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,350
The first bullet Invincible General.

87
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,510
I work desperately for the first time.

88
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,010
Great.

89
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,260
How were you doing abroad?

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,200
Great, except that I had to speak English

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,300
and the food was terrible.

92
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,990
But I was happy as I could do and learn what I liked.

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,300
Won't you go abroad again?

94
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,840
Are you going to give up?

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,680
We'll miss many things in our life.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,360
I know what I want,

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,260
so every step I take is in that direction.

98
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,530
I'll never regret.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,300
That's what you told me.

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,430
Don't say that I corrupted you.

101
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,170
Are you sober now?

102
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,720
Yes.

103
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
My room is up there.

104
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,990
Thank you for sending me back.

105
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,630
See you.

106
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,160
See you tomorrow.

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,510
What do you want to eat today?

108
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,030
What do you want to eat today?

109
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,280
Whatever.

110
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,870
Then eat nothing.

111
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,310
Who it it?

112
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,150
Who are you?

113
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,520
I want to meet Li Xun.

114
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,310
She wants to meet you.

115
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,330
Long time no see.

116
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,530
What can I do for you?

117
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,600
May I come in?

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,460
Do you have time?

119
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,470
Let's go out for dinner.

120
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,610
No.

121
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,220
He is cooking.

122
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,810
Okay. Let's dine at home.

123
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,520
I didn't prepare food for you.

124
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,040
Never mind. I'll prepare it.

125
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,560
The dishes are ready.

126
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,220
Please enjoy your meal.

127
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,590
Send Mr. Wang back.

128
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,650
Enjoy it. Help yourself.

129
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,100
Okay.

130
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,020
Do you really work in the Flying Company?

131
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,260
Ask Old Gao and you'll know.

132
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,340
He keeps watch on us every day.

133
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,310
How about Zhu Yun?

134
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,660
If you're curious about her,

135
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,670
ask her directly.

136
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,100
I knew she'd go to work there with you.

137
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,010
But don't you think it's a bit shabby to start like this?

138
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,720
I'll leave the key here.

139
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,460
Drive my car.

140
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,110
My dad has a vacant apartment.

141
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,840
You can live there to make use of it.

142
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,940
It's cramped here.

143
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,730
You're here to poach him?

144
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,220
You want to keep me as a boy toy?

145
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,060
Have you ever thought that if we were together,

146
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,150
everything would be different now?

147
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,720
Can we make it up now?

148
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,740
I can't.

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,290
No.

150
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,600
I feel a little sick.

151
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,450
Li Xun,

152
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,690
you never regreted it?

153
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,330
Xu Lina,

154
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,650
you especially came to this rented house and reminded me.

155
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,220
Thank you.

156
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,320
If there is one thing I don't regret,

157
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
it's that I refused you.

158
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,040
You will never be able...

159
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,240
to compare to Zhu Yun.

160
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,270
I won't see you out.

161
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,530
Old Gao has been on a business trip for just a few days.

162
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,210
I have to tell him about this.

163
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,420
What are you doing here?

164
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,060
What am I doing here?

165
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,040
Get to know my enemy.

166
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,120
What else can you do except playing dirty like this?

167
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,510
Playing dirty?

168
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,520
Old Gao thought of this.

169
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,350
It has nothing to do with me.

170
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,060
You're contemptible.

171
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,860
Good-for-nothing;

172
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,570
You look furious.

173
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,330
What did he do to you?

174
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,670
You make me sick.

175
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,300
Xu Lina, don't forget that Old Gao provides everything for you.

176
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,680
- Go. 
 - Yes. 
 - He bought the car for you.

177
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,050
Mom, it's time to eat.

178
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,000
Xiuzhu's painting is so imposing.

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,260
I like it very much.

180
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,320
Thank you, Aunt.

181
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,940
Come on. Please taste this tomato beef soup I made.

182
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,450
Thank you for making so many dishes for us.

183
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,920
What are you doing here this time?

184
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,210
I can accompany for the next two days.

185
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,840
You don't need to accompany me.

186
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,560
I came to see what Zhu Yun was doing.

187
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,600
She has been helping me with the painting exhibition these days.

188
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,140
I'm going to ask her to go back in a few days.

189
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,050
You just rent this place.

190
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,450
I can help you with guest coordination and site layout.

191
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,980
When will your exhibition start?

192
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,770
- Next week. 
 - Next month.

193
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,090
It'll start next week and end next month.

194
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,260
Okay.

195
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,930
At that time, I will definitely come to join you.

196
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,350
Then Zhu Yun can stay here to help with your exhibition preparation.

197
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,460
Here. I wish you a successful exhibition.

198
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,970
Thank you.

199
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,860
Mom, I'll make a phone call.

200
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,540
Xiuzhu,

201
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,250
is everything all right with Yun recently?

202
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,360
She has been helping me with my exhibition recently.

203
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,000
What's wrong?

204
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,850
To tell the truth,

205
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,030
although that young man is in prison,

206
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,860
Zhu Yun overthinks too much.

207
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,920
I fear that she'll go and meet him without telling us.

208
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,910
Keep an eye on her.

209
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,400
Don't worry.

210
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,200
I'll report to you as soon as possible if anything goes wrong.

211
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,770
Okay.

212
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,140
I'm relieved to have you here.

213
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,600
- Enjoy your meal. 
 - Okay.

214
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,940
 You said the exhibition will start next week. 

215
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,350
 What if my mom comes next week? 

216
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,290
Taste this tomato beef soup.

217
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,800
Tell me. How does it fare to your liking?

218
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:47,200
I didn't expect that you could draw and cook now.

219
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,960
   

220
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,550
Sorry, Auntie. I'll answer the phone.

221
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,230
Hello, Mom.

222
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,150
Brother Xiuzhu, you're sending our enemy a bomb.

223
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,310
You said the exhibition would start next week and end next month.

224
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,820
My mom can come anytime.

225
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,250
What if she comes suddenly?

226
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,930
Don't worry. I can deal with it.

227
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,660
I'm having dinner with Zhu Yun and Aunt Liu.

228
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,810
It's almost midnight there, right?

229
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,780
 Convince her. 

230
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,560
I have to go back to work this afternoon.

231
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,720
Let's just say we're going to meet the guests of the art exhibition.

232
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,800
Don't let it slip.

233
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,360
Okay. No problem.

234
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,840
Your mom?

235
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,810
Mom, Aunt Liu is here with me.

236
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,730
Do you want to talk to her?

237
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,840
Okay.

238
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,420
Hello, Jiang.

239
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,930
I...

240
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,150
Hello?

241
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,810
-  Hello? 
 - I'll check it.

242
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,460
The phone hung up.

243
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,860
The infrastructure abroad is unreliable.

244
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,280
The connection is broken.

245
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,620
- How about calling back? 
 - Okay.

246
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,090
Don't bother her. It's time to sleep.

247
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,800
How do you know that?

248
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,950
Uncle goes fishing and Aunt goes running every morning.

249
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,600
Now it's midnight there.

250
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,730
You remember it better than I do.

251
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,410
Of course. The lake near your house connects to a private lawn.

252
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,320
It would be wonderful to hold a wedding ceremony

253
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,750
in such a beautiful place.

254
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,060
By the way, Aunt, well,

255
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,600
I'll meet a professor of the School of Art of Nanhu University.

256
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,240
I'm afraid I can't keep you and Zhu Yun company.

257
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,610
You're familiar with Nanhu University.

258
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,280
Yes, I am. I'll go with you.

259
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,320
Right.

260
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,780
Then-Then I'll go with her.

261
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,540
No problem. You can go together.

262
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,260
- Leave the room card to me. 
 - Okay.

263
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,070
I'll go back first.

264
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,300
- Taste this shrimp, Aunt. 
 - Okay.

265
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,000
Great. We're safe.

266
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,960
So I covered you to let you go to your company to play games?

267
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,390
It's important to the fate of three people and Flying Network.

268
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,340
Why are you staring at me?

269
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,390
Zhu Yun, you've changed.

270
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,110
You aren't who you were abroad.

271
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,040
You just finished your work mechanically abroad.

272
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,400
But now when you talk about your game,

273
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,680
you sound so proud and your eyes are shining.

274
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,910
After all, this is the first work I'll complete as an independent group leader.

275
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,600
Okay. I'll walk you upstairs.

276
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,950
No need. I can go up by myself.

277
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,620
Well, let me have a look at the birthplace of the rising stars of the Chinese game industry.

278
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,200
We're a small company.

279
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,330
This elevator is old.

280
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,590
Wait.

281
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,680
Sir, wait.

282
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,390
You looked familiar when getting off the car downstairs.

283
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,970
It's you.

284
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,510
- Your friend? 
 - Yes.

285
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,850
You work with Zhu Yun?

286
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,640
Hello. Tian Xiuzhu.

287
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,400
Nice to meet you.

288
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,250
Hello, are you painter Tian Xiuzhu?

289
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,280
Yes.

290
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,270
You're my idol.

291
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,960
I have two idols in my life.

292
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,070
One is Xu Kaiyang, my university senior.

293
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,830
The other is you. I like you so much.

294
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,890
- It's an honor for our company. 
 - He is seeing his idol.

295
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,750
In addition to its appearance,

296
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,180
talents matter a lot to the strength of a company.

297
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,740
Zhu Yun and our company chose each other.

298
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,880
We're a powerful combination.

299
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,850
In recent years, startups in China start from scratch

300
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,540
and develop step by step.

301
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,380
Li Xun. Li Xun, let me introduce you.

302
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,680
This is Zhu's friend.

303
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,210
Tian Xiuzhu, a well-known painter. He is very famous.

304
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,750
I know him.

305
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,850
Mr. Tian, that's how he is.

306
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,350
- He is indifferent. 
 - Never mind.

307
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,440
- Taste this. 
 - Okay.

308
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,180
If you don't like it, I'll add some milk for you.

309
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,450
Thanks. All stages are cleared.

310
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,950
No wonder you have time to do other things.

311
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,180
Xiuzhu, we're going to work.

312
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,280
Would you go back first?

313
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,500
Okay. When should I come to pick you up?

314
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,210
No need.

315
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,670
You came out with me.

316
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,270
Your mom is waiting for us.

317
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,960
- You're right. Come at 5:00. 
 - Okay.

318
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
- See you. 
 - See you.

319
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
- I'm leaving. 
 - See you, Mr. Tian.

320
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,070
Taste this, okay?

321
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,110
No, thanks for the offer.

322
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,440
Thank you. I'm leaving.

323
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,490
Are you leaving now?

324
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,750
Let-Let me see you out.

325
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,440
Zhu Yun, see him out. Go.

326
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,900
Take care, Mr. Tian.

327
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,970
Come here when you have time.

328
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,200
Take care.

329
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,870
- I'll go say hello to Aunt. 
 - No need.

330
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,580
Mom.

331
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,070
Aunt.

332
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,560
Perfect timing.

333
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,200
Come out with me.

334
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,620
Yun, I rented a room for you.

335
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,010
Mom, you should have asked me before renting it.

336
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,370
It would be too late.

337
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,150
So many people wanted to rent the room.

338
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,610
Fortunately, I immediately signed the contract and paid the money this afternoon.

339
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,140
Otherwise, it wouldn't be us who are looking at the house now.

340
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,630
I don't even have the right to live where I want to now.

341
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,060
You can choose, and Aunt will decide.

342
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,380
Xiuzhu, what do you think about this room?

343
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,990
Great. Very great, Aunt.

344
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,920
The environment is beautiful here.

345
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,990
And it's secure here.

346
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,310
I think the most important thing is that coincidentally,

347
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,770
it's just one kilometer away from my studio.

348
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,480
We can walk here.

349
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,450
- Really? 
 - Coincidence?

350
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,140
Mom, you planned this with Xiuzhu?

351
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,000
No. No. No.

352
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
It has nothing to do with him.

353
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,100
I rented this room for you on my own.

354
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,900
How much is the monthly rent for this room?

355
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Don't worry about it.

356
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,000
I paid for three months.

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,600
You can pay me back if you have money.

358
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,700
I have no money.

359
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,600
Never mind.

360
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,700
Well, I think I need two domestic workers,

361
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,600
one for cleaning and the other for cooking.

362
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,900
I want them to do housekeeping. You'll pay them.

363
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Aunt, how about this?

364
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,000
Zhu Yun led a frugal life abroad.

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,400
Now let's make her life easy.

366
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,800
Tomorrow, I'll find a domestic worker to do the cleaning for her.

367
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,200
I'll pay.

368
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,700
If Zhu Yun wants to eat, come to my studio.

369
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,500
I can cook for her anytime.

370
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,900
Great.

371
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Xiuzhu, please take care of her.

372
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,100
Aunt, don't mention that.

373
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Please, Aunt.

374
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
Please take care of her.

375
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
I will.

376
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,200
- See you. 
 - See you.

377
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,500
You cooperated well with my mom.

378
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,900
   

379
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,600
   

380
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,400
Come in.

381
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,900
Go ahead. Because of your girlfriend?

382
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,700
Her name is Zhu Yun.

383
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,000
Just as I thought. I guessed it.

384
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,500
Well, you met the painter.

385
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Don't mention him.

386
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Okay. I won't.

387
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,700
Would you forget it if I didn't mention it?

388
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm warning you.

389
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,500
Don't give me a lecture.

390
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,100
You look affected.

391
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,400
You don't need my help in terms of career.

392
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,200
As to relations,

393
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,900
to tell you the truth,

394
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,700
you're too naive.

395
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,000
At the time, it was you who drove away Sister-in-law.

396
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,800
You hurt her feelings severely.

397
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,600
How do you know she can't be by your side?

398
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
You drove her away at your own will.

399
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
Did you ask her what she thought?

400
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,000
You're sulking here alone.

401
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Why don't you ask her if she is dating the painter?

402
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,000
Ask her?

403
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
You want me to ask her these questions?

404
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,800
How?

405
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,700
You're too paranoid.

406
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,800
The only thing I'll never learn from you since we met is

407
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
how you treat girls.

408
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,800
They're the most precious flowers in the world.

409
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,600
A sign of disturbance

410
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,800
will ruin their luster and fragrance.

411
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,400
That's why they turn old more easily than men.

412
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,300
You're disgusting.

413
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,200
Stop dancing.

414
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,600
You know what, you didn't give others a chance back then.

415
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,200
You chose for yourself.

416
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,500
So you don't know how they got through.

417
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,300
I don't know if she still loves you.

418
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
But what I know is that

419
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,000
if you want to achieve any goals now,

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,800
she will be the most able person to help you at any cost in the world.

421
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,500
Don't treat feelings like a computer.

422
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
They are't binary.

423
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,600
You should be mature.

424
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,500
Computers are binary.

425
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
They accept only two types of inputs,

426
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,600
because digital circuits can only accept 0 and 1.

427
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,600
That's because nonlinear electronic components

428
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,900
have only two nonlinear regions.

429
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,500
Stop.

430
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,700
I won't think about this again...

431
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
until this matter is completely solved.

432
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
Won't she think about it?

433
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,400
She's different from you.

434
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,900
She's prone to hitting dead ends, especially when it comes to the two of you.

435
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,600
If it's impossible, don't let her misunderstand.

436
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,900
Don't let her miss her own chance.

437
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,900
You know what? Your tenderness is a double-edged sword to her.

438
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,600
Once she feels that you can't move on,

439
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,000
she won't move on.

440
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,900
I can move on.

441
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Then why bother coming here?

442
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,400
I think you are jealous.

443
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,700
Get out.

444
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,540
   

445
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,100
You're obviously flirting under the guise of work.

446
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,300
Group Leader Zhu and Li.

447
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,400
Wasn't this just a change of identity at the base back then?

448
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,000
She is right. A secret office romance play.

449
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,900
The PUA battle between female boss and male subordinate.

450
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,000
What you say sounds filthy.

451
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,300
Come on. We're obviously praising your innocence.

452
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,400
- Yes. 
 - He just fixed the computer for you

453
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,600
and you just had midnight snacks somewhere that you two had visited together.

454
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,100
Isn't this flirting?

455
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,800
We did these for work.

456
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,300
But listen, we'll start making weapon effects next week. And...

457
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,400
We're not curious about that.

458
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,800
You're annoying.

459
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,400
Anyway, I'm energetic after drinking coffee.

460
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,300
If you say nothing interesting, we won't let you go.

461
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,000
Tell us. What you are thinking?

462
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,700
What do you mean?

463
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,900
We agreed that we would be ordinary colleagues.

464
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,400
She is exposing herself when trying to hide.

465
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,700
Let me ask you. Are you happy?

466
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,400
Yes. I can do what I like without feeling tired.

467
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,300
Just as you did at the base.

468
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,900
Honestly, I've known you for so many years.

469
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,200
But only when you're with Li Xun, can you be passionate,

470
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,400
impulsive, and brave to go forward

471
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,100
as if nothing would frighten you.

472
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,200
He did change me.

473
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,700
If I hadn't joined the base back then, I wouldn't have found that I liked programming.

474
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,300
But it's history. It's all over.

475
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,400
Now I have to consider my tone when I speak to him.

476
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,000
I hope that we can talk normally.

477
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
You're worried because you care about him so much.

478
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm worried about the both of you.

479
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,200
It has been so many years.

480
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,500
Why can't you make up your mind?

481
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Get together if you like each other and separate if you don't.

482
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,600
Is it difficult?

483
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Why don't you just change?

484
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
Pick one of my boyfriends.

485
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,000
You can try to get along with them.

486
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,700
Okay?

487
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,900
Or pick one of my clients.

488
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,100
Get out.

489
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,900
Drink it.

490
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,100
   

491
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,500
The deadline for uploading past.

492
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,100
Click it now.

493
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,200
I'll test it again.

494
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Come on. It's time.

495
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,000
Do you want the client to scold you?

496
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
It'll be ready soon.

497
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,700
When?

498
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,200
I'll upload it soon.

♫  If love remains warm  ♫

500
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,800
Quite simple.

501
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,600
♫  This dream will automatically abort  ♫

502
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,800
♫  When you wake up, please stay  ♫

503
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,700
♫  Don't go, fate is not a journey  ♫

504

♫  Hold onto me, don't get lost  ♫

505

508
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,300
♫  I care so much about you  ♫

509
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,400
Thank you.

510
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,600
Never mind.

511
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,300
It's just a closed beta.

512
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,700
It can't be perfect.

513
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,900
I think there is enough content.

514
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,200
We can add more gradually after it's launched.

515
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,400
Keep in mind that this company hasn't launched any products.

516
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,100
Invincible General is our only bullet now.

517
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
If we screw things up,

518
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
we have to pay for it this year and next.

519
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,900
Am I too indecisive?

520
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,700
Group Leader Zhu,

521
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,400
now you don't need anyone's affirmation.

522
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,300
You should have confidence in yourself.

523
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
I think Senior is right.

524
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,700
We have to trust ourselves.

525
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,900
If not, how should we trust others and build a family?

526
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,600
- Get out. 
 - Okay.

527
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,800
I tried to play the closed beta of our game.

528
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,700
It's really interesting.

529
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,800
Playing the closed beta,

530
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,300
clients think that our game is great.

531
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,800
Great.

532
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,900
But with its downloads after the official launch,

533
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,200
we'll know whether the game is great.

534
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,500
Zhang Fang.

535
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,400
Do a good promotion before the game goes online.

536
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
Don't worry about money.

537
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
You must get it done at any cost.

538
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,200
Don't be a drag on us.

539
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,300
Listen!  If you do anything wrong, you'll be seriously punished.

540
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,200
Did I make myself clear?

541
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,800
- Yes, but... 
 - Dismissed.

542
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,200
Do we have money?

543
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,100
- Do we-Do we have money for promotion? 
 - We have.

544
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,900
I saw the promotion fee on the statement.

545
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,000
Yes, but you and he used it as salaries.

546
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Don't mix that with promotion.

547
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,700
Without promotion, our efforts in the early stage will be in vain.

548
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I...

549
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,600
How much do we have?

550
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,100
- 50,000 yuan? 
 - 5,000 yuan.

551
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,800
Are you kidding me?

552
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,700
I know we should do promotion,

553
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,300
but we have no money.

554
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
Is that my fault?

555
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,500
 Yes. 

556
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,700
You're CFO.

557
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,600
Right. Right.

558
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,500
Don't worry.

559
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,300
Focus on the posters first.

560
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
We'll find a way later.

561
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,700
These are my masterpieces. What do you think?

562
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Great. You're reliable this time.

563
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,900
I think they're great.

564
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,700
I don't think so.

565
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,000
- Why? 
 - They're ordinary.

566
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Ordinary?

567
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,500
Is this a problem?

568
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,800
It isn't spectacular enough.

569
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,300
Is it too late to change?

570
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
I-I've tried my best.

571
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,500
I know that, but the concept poster is a facade.

572
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,400
It's the users' first impression.

573
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,800
We must make it impressive.

574
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
What should I do?

575
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,500
Redo it?

576
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
I guessed that.

577
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,300
Come on. It's too late.

578
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,600
- I think this is not bad. 
 - Even so, we have to change.

579
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,000
I don't mean to offend you.

580
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,200
But this is his superior limit.

581
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,900
That's what he can do. He's not a great painter.

582
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,800
Even if you give him more time, he can't draw what you want.

583
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
That makes sense.

584
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,900
   

585
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,000
   

586
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,600
Next.

587
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,000
Next.

588
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,200
Next.

589
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,900
Wait.

590
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,800
What do you want to do? Are you going to work as a painter?

591
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,200
People specialize in different subjects.

592
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,700
An-An artist should design it. Why should we bother?

593
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,100
Shut up.

594
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,700
Sorry, sir. I found that Miss Zhu Yun checked out a few days ago

595
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,200
and never checked in again.

596
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
What's wrong?

597
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,400
Please help me find out if there is any rental information of Zhu Yun.

598
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,100
Send me the address when you find it.

599
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,200
Now?

600
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
I have no way to find it for you now.

601
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,800
It's your business.

602
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,700
Come on. You always tell me what to do.

603
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,500
Are you...

604
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,100
He even hung up.

605
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,900
   

606
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,500
Hello, it's me.

607
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,600
 Go ahead. 

608
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,300
Call Ren Di and ask her where Zhu Yun is.

609
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,900
 Buddy, you could have asked her directly. 

610
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
Please ask for me.

611
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
 Okay. 

612
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,500
Thanks.

613
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,700
Ask me for help directly if you want.

614
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,300
How do you know?

615
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,400
You've been staring at the posters the whole night.

616
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,600
Okay. I'll design it for you.

617
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,700
Do you have time?

618
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,400
It's easy for me.

619
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,700
Moreover, you asked me for help.

620
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,400
It's easy.

621
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,400
But as a startup,

622
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,600
our company is short of money.

623
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,200
No payment?

624
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,800
Yes. We'll pay you.

625
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Well, how much should we pay?

626
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,600
Book me first.

627
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,900
For such a huge favor, there are no thank yous.

628
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,300
No, no, no. Thank yous are a definite.

629
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,000
When you have enough money, pay me a big sum.

630
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,500
Okay.

631
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,100
When do you want it?

632
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,600
At your convenience.

633
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
How about tomorrow?

634
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,700
Do you see me as a convenience?

635
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,000
Tomorrow night will be fine. The sooner the better.

636
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,800
What are you going to do?

637
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,600
I'll clean up and go to work in the studio.

638
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,100
I'll go with you and help you.

639
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,100
To supervise me, right?

640
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
 Who is it? 

641
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,600
 Brother Xiuzhu, open the door for me. 

642
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,000
 Coming. 

643
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,300
Who is it?

644
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,800
Nobody.

645
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:49,210


646
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,800
   

647
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,000
 I liked you. So what? 

648
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,300
 Go to ask anyone out there if he remembers the one who he liked at 18. 

649
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,200
 Do you still like her? 

650
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,600
 No. 

651
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,400
 It's strange. 

652
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,900
 Now that you don't like her, why do you care about her staying with the painter? 

653
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,500
 Is he Li Xun? 

654
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,800
 Yes, it's him. 

655
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,900
 Shall I call him in? 

656
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,400
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

657
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,800
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

658
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:29,500
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

659
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:35,200
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

660
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,600
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

661
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:46,700
♫  We will not separate  ♫

662
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,700
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

663
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,200
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

664
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,200
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

665
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,500
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

666
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,000
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

667
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,500
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

668
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,700
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

669
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,300
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

670
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,800
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

671
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,300
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

672
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,700
♫  That hot firework  ♫

673
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:51,000
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

674
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:07,250
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

675
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,000
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

676
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,100
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

677
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,600
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

678
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,800
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

679
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,400
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

680
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,600
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

681
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,200
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

682
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:42,700
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

683
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,400
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

684
