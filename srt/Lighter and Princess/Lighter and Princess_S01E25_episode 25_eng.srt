00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000


2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,800
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,600
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,300
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,700
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,300
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,500
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,100
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,900
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,600
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,100
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,900
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,000
   

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
   

22
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,000
Morning.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,900
It's late, My Lady.

24
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,600
Can you have a sense of time?

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
This is your first day to work.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Couldn't you come earlier to get to know our company?

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,300
Old Zhang, stop criticizing her. It's rare for our company to recruit new employees.

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,100
Assign tasks now.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
We still need to do a lot of work.

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,400
What if Mr. Dong asks about it?

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,900
I agree.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700
- You're right. 
 - Of course.

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,600
Now I will introduce our work.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,400
If you were not here, I'd have forgotten you were also a new employee of our company.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
There are many available seats here.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,300
Choose the one you like.

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,500
Let me give you a rough introduction to our company.

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,700
Let me first introduce the three senior employees to you.

39
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,100
I am Zhang Fang,

40
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,900
    
 a programmer who also works as the CFO,

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,200
    
 CHO and COO of our company.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,500
so I'm in charge of all the company affairs.

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
This main technical backbone is Zhao Teng.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,600
As the CTO,

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,500
   
 he is mainly in charge of game design, 

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,900
    
 test and so on.

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,000
That man is good at nothing.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,900
    
 I don't know what he works as, either.

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,500
    
 He is Guo Shijie.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,700
He said he is the art director in charge of the animation,

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
UI, 3D, floor sweeping, floor mopping, and parcel reception.

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Anyway, he's a good-for-nothing.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,400
Why didn't he become a programmer?

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,100
He did want to.

55
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,700
I-I can do everything except this.

56
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,600
If he could do this, he'd become a programmer.

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,600
The last member is Mr. Dong who usually stays in the office.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Mr. Dong.

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,400
Mr. Dong, Mr. Dong...

60
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,000
You'll know about him after he comes.

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,700
Well, Zhao Teng, assemble computers for them.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,300
Zhao Teng, assemble computers!

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
Don't pretend to be deaf.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,700
Assemble computers!

65
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,400
Where are the computers?

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I can do it.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
You criminal, also learned this?

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes.

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,200
Good.

70
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,100
Follow me.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
What happened? Did anyone call me just now?

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
You were asked to assemble computers.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,100
Could you be friendly?

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,200
They're new colleagues.

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,100
Well, you've finished assembling a computer within five minutes?

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,400
It's unbelievable.

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, what did you do in the past?

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
I assembled the computers of this model three years ago,

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,700
but I do the same now.

80
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,600
It's not a computer offered to you for free.

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,200
It's enough that this computer can work.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
You still can work on it.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,000
It really can be started.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
Don't take off your gloves.

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,500
You still need to assemble the other one. Assemble one for her.

86
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,300
It's none of my business. I won't do it for her.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
Well, what's wrong?

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Aren't you friends coming together?

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
I can do it.

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,500
Watch out. You almost damaged the parcels.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You should reflect on your behavior of almost occupying the entire corridor!

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,900
What do you mean? Can you be polite?

94
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
I'm just impolite to you. Rubbish!

95
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,400
Don't you think I dare beat you?

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,500
You-You dare beat me? Come on.

97
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,000
Beat here. Beat here.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
If you don't do so, you're not a man!

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
Don't stop him. Let go of him.

100
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,900
Let him beat me!

101
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
Mr. Zhang.

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100
Zhang Fang!

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,400
I told you not to place parcels at the gate of our company many times.

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,500
It'll block our road to making a fortune. Don't you know it?

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,800
You don't keep it in mind, right?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
You're Mr. Dong?

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,400
It's you.

108
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,000
Sure enough, enemies always meet.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,100
You came to work for me?

110
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Let me give you an introduction. This is Zhu Yun, a new employee who studied abroad.

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,300
She is very capable.

113
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,400
An overseas returnee? Amazing.

114
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Overseas returnee.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,300
- What about him? 
 - This is Li Xun.

116
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,200
He-He...

117
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,600
He-He... Anyway, I-I recruited them as you required.

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,500
All in English?

119
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
What are you reading?

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Personality.

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm asking you what you're reading.

122
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
GitHub.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Speak Chinese.

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,400
A foreign exchange website for programmers.

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I didn't ask you.

126
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
You're talkative.

127
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
You recruited her?

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
I-I haven't-haven't...

129
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,200
Teach her to keep silent.

130
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll train her.

131
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
What an awesome overseas returnee.

132
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
So talkative.

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
Mr. Dong.

134
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,800
I told you many times. This place is not your house.

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
How dare you wear slippers at work!

136
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,100
- Can you follow the rules? 
 - I see.

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,000
Edematous. My feet are edematous.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Go on working!

139
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,500
Here is another bag.

140
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I'm helping you lose weight.

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,600
You... No need.

142
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Mr. Dong, you haven't come for long.

143
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,600
Let me report our work to you.

144
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,200
Look.

145
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Do they look like a tyrant and a eunuch?

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
What's Mr. Dong's background?

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Why don't you tell me?

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,100
He is a gang leader?

149
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,700
There are no gangs in China.

150
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,500
In other words, during my absence,

151
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,200
the only project of our company,

152
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
"Invincible General."

153
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
Yes.

154
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,700
"Invincible General" is still being designed.

155
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,100
Don't tell me that you didn't even make any progress.

156
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,300
To be specific...

157
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,800
Shut up! Meeting!

158
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,400
Meeting!

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well, I can't understand.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,300
Why couldn't you complete such a simple game in a few months?

161
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,700
Do you know how much I invested in it?

162
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,600
But now I can't even see a demo.

163
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,500
You're incompetent,

164
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,800
aren't you?

165
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Yes, I am.

166
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,300
And you.

167
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
Good-for-nothing.

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,500
I admit that I should be blamed for it.

169
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
I admit.

170
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Well, do you think our game is fun?

171
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,400
I think it's...

172
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,600
not fun.

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,100
You don't even think it's fun.

174
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,800
How can it attract players?

175
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,100
When you introduced this project to me, you used a special term...

176
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,700
- Hot.  
 - Hot!

177
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,400
Tell me why you can't go on with this hot game.

178
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
Why?

179
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Did you make an analysis?

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,600
What's the game?

181
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,500
Don't break in.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,000
How could you recruit such an ill-behaved employee?

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,700
What are we doing? We're having a strategic meeting.

184
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,000
If you're all ill-behaved, will we win?

185
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Well,

186
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,900
facing you good-for-nothings, I don't want to go on scolding.

187
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,300
Now I just want one of you to stand up

188
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,700
and tell me he can complete this project alone!

189
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
See?

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,700
Stop!

191
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,400
Did I dismiss the meeting?

192
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
Can you get a result from this meeting?

193
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,000
If not, don't waste time.

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
Say again. Say again!

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
- Say again! 
 - I can!

196
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,700
I can complete this project alone.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
You...

198
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,400
can?

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,900
I can.

200
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
- Zhu Yun. 
 - Zhu Yun.

201
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,400
The doctor returned from overseas.

202
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,000
You may know a little about our corporate culture.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 This company has corporate culture? 

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
When the boss speaks, don't break in.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,900
If you promise the boss, it means that you ensure you'll complete it.

206
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,700
So you still can?

207
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,300
I can.

208
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,400
I like such employees as you who always rush forward.

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you know why?

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,400
Such employees are prone to yielding to trouble.

211
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,600
Especially when such a proud and arrogant

212
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
doctor returned from overseas

213
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
and able woman apologizes to me,

214
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
it's more exciting.

215
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Then I entrust the project...

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
"Invincible General"

217
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,900
to you.

218
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,800
You were in charge of this project before?

219
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
You help her with it.

220
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,700
And that thorn...

221
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Li Xun!

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,600
You also join her group!

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, Iron Lady.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Iron Lady!

225
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,700
Iron Lady.

226
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,100
You're the group leader.

227
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,800
You three are a project group.

228
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,200
If you complete it, you'll have a bonus and get a raise,

229
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,900
or else you'll be fired together!

230
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
Understand?

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hello, Dong's special car will serve you.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What's the game you just talked about?

233
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,000
Group Leader, you may be capable.

234
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,600
However, didn't you act recklessly before knowing about this game?

235
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,500
I just wanted to help you solve the problem.

236
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
You help us solve the problem?

237
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,000
You just worried that Mr. Dong would fight with your friend.

238
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,500
Don't forget the fan.

239
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Then the group of "Invincible General" is officially established today.

240
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,100
I assign today's tasks.

241
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,800
Zhao Teng, you summarize the previous information for the following project meeting.

242
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,500
Okay.

243
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,000
You, give us technical support temporarily.

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,600
Specifically, assemble the computer for me first.

245
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
- Any problem? 
 - No problem, Group Leader.

246
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
- Let's begin. 
 - Okay.

247
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,950
Let me give you an introduction to the current project first.

248
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,200
Li Xun, every dog has its day.

249
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
Morning.

250
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
Good morning.

251
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,200
- Morning, Group Leader. 
 - Morning.

253
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Zhao Teng. Li Xun. Go in for a meeting.

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
Okay.

255
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Enjoy yourself.

256
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Li Xun, meeting!

257
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,400
Group Leader, your friend won't come.

258
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,700
Don't worry. He'll come in.

259
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,300
Let's begin.

260
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,600
"Invincible General" is a war simulation game.

261
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,400
It's simple and focuses on fierceness, excitement, and righteous ardor.

262
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Li Xun, have you finished watching it?

263
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,300
What do you think of it?

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,200
Fierceness, excitement, and righteous ardor?

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
Are you kidding?

266
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
What's wrong?

267
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,900
You can't even be aware of such obvious errors?

268
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,400
Have you forgotten the history you learned?

269
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,500
That is Lü Bu, isn't that?

270
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,500
The Warring States Period is the age background of this game,

271
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,500
but Lü Bu was born in the Three Kingdoms Period.

272
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,100
Really? Yeah.

273
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Xiaojian should be blamed for it.

274
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,100
He must have imitated it from other games.

275
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,300
Anything else?

276
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
Take a closer look.

277
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
No problem.

278
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,200
The Three Kingdoms Period is

279
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,300
the age background of more than 90% of the war simulation games on the market,

280
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
but the background of this game is the Warring States Period.

281
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,200
Qin Shihuang eliminated and unified the six states.

282
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,400
If players can be attracted by this story, it'll be a major breakthrough.

283
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,600
I didn't mean this.

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,200
There were only saddles but no stirrups during the Warring States Period.

285
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Stirrups were invented in the Han Dynasty.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,500
Really?

287
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Fire was the totem of the Zhou people.

288
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,400
Qin Shihuang believed in the Five-element Theory.

289
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,500
He thought the Qin Dynasty would extinguish the fire Zhou as water.

290
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,900
Black stands for water, so the Qin people liked black.

291
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,500
Qin Shihuang went on an expedition in conspicuous lemon yellow?

292
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Is he SpongeBob SquarePants?

293
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,700
The current games are too low.

294
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,800
Even the street fighting isn't so low.

295
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,600
Set it aside.

296
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,400
What's more, everything in this game is related to the Three Kingdoms Period,

297
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,700
which is inconsistent with history.

298
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,000
You know much about history.

299
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,300
However, is it so important?

300
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,400
Users are always much smarter and more sensitive than who they are in your imagination.

301
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,500
Your current perfunctoriness will finally be reflected as a game achievement.

302
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,700
Your criticism makes sense.

303
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Can you give some substantive suggestions for modification?

304
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,000
Design a new one.

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Well, the players of this game are less-educated.

306
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,900
They won't care about and know these.

307
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Do you agree, Group Leader?

308
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,500
- Design a new one. 
 - What?

309
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,700
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

310
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,200
Zhao Teng, I heard from Guo Shijie that you'd designed many games,

311
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,700
but none of them were popular.

312
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,600
You can't go on like this.

313
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,300
Don't you want to design a game that can show your strength?

314
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,000
I also wanted to design a popular one, but I couldn't.

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No one cooperated with me, but I still...

316
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,700
- Go on. 
 - Just do this first.

317
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,300
Well, it is too bad.

318
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,900
- It'll take much time to modify this game. 
 - You must do so.

319
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,400
Don't be afraid of trouble and think much. Just do your best.

320
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
Now I'm the project leader.

321
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,000
If something really goes wrong, you won't be blamed.

322
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,500
I don't worry about this.

323
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,300
A friend told me not to always do easy things,

324
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,700
that is, we should look for trouble actively.

325
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,000
It's useless to escape.

326
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,500
Come on.

327
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,900
Do you think she is a masochist?

328
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,200
Okay. I won't escape.

329
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,900
Otherwise, I'm a coward!

330
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
- Hello. 
 - Is this your take-out?

331
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes. Thank you.

332
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm treating you to breakfast.

333
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,900
- So good? 
 - Thanks, Group Leader.

334
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,400
- Thanks, Group Leader. 
 - You're welcome.

335
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,600
Well, this is for you.

336
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,300
This is for me.

337
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,700
Try your best to read this book.

338
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,000
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

339
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,500
Li Xun.

340
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Li Xun, do you still like me?

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,100
When can you no longer be self-sentimental?

342
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,300
That's good. Then we can cooperate.

343
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,800
Group Leader Zhu, when did I promise to cooperate with you?

344
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,200
If you don't want to cooperate, you can resign.

345
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,790
Now I'm the project leader.

346
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,100
As long as you don't quit Flying, we must cooperate.

347
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,100
Don't try to drive me away by playing tricks on me.

348
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,000
Before getting L&amp;P back, I won't leave.

349
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
I'll treat you as my colleague.

350
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
I hope you can do the same.

351
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Ms. Xu.

352
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
Ms. Xu.

353
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Ms. Xu.

354
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,500
 Put these printed materials in the meeting room later. 

355
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,100
 Okay. 

356
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
 - Ms. Xu. 
 - There should be no something wrong. 

357
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
 Send the summary sheet to me later. 

358
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,700
 Okay. 

359
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
Li Xun really went to that Flying Network?

360
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,300
Not only Li Xun, Zhu Yun also went there.

361
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Tell me about Flying Network.

362
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,300
This company was founded less than one year ago,

363
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,200
had only four members,

364
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
with registered capital of only 1 million yuan.

365
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,300
The information you're browsing is about their boss, Dong Siyang.

366
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,700
He used to be a wrestler but didn't make any achievements.

367
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,700
He quit when he was ineligible for wrestling

368
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,900
and is now a taxi driver.

369
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,000
Later, I heard that he was imprisoned for hurting someone to get revenge for his friend.

370
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,100
What's their capital source?

371
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,800
It comes from Dong Siyang.

372
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,400
The start-up capital comes from the compensation for demolition of Dong Siyang's old home.

373
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
He is an upstart.

374
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,700
He knows little about the internet, let alone game development.

375
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,500
And his three employees are all good-for-nothings.

376
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,550
Show their games to me.

377
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,160
None.

378
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,860
Their company has only one registered game called...

379
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,010
"Invincible General".

380
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,640
It doesn't conform to the current market trend at all.

381
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,440
It's been a year since the registration, but it hasn't been put into service yet.

382
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,050
Don't worry.

383
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,510
Their company has zero performance now.

384
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,420
It won't last long.

385
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,710
Li Xun and Zhu Yun joined such a terrible company.

386
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,760
Two madmen.

387
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,490
Do you think Li Xun is a madman or a fool?

388
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,160
Keep an eye on him.

389
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,920
I see.

390
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,730
Okay.

391
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,100
I'm leaving.

392
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,730
Old Gao,

393
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,210
why won't you allow me to be the ambassador for the "Pink Memory"?

394
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,020
Your image is not suitable.

395
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,370
"Pink Memory" is an education simulation game about first love,

396
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,060
so its image ambassador should match its style.

397
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,620
It means that my temperament is bad.

398
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,070
Lina, don't be mischievous.

399
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,500
This is the company's business,

400
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,550
and many shareholders voted for this decision.

401
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,940
Don't lie to me.

402
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:28,030
I heard that only you voted against this decision in the meeting.

403
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
My company has so many games.

404
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,870
You can choose another one.

405
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,430
I just want this.

406
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,500
I like it.

407
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,350
Honey, don't be mischievous.

408
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,960
Now everyone knows you're my wife.

409
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,210
If I didn't vote against it, no one would dare do so.

410
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,020
Then others won't give opinions, and only I have the say.

411
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,010
You're indeed the only one to have the say.

412
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,350
Well, give me a reason.

413
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,030
Now that you voted against it, tell me why I'm ineligible.

414
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,300
I'm not young enough or don't look like a first love?

415
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
The sage even didn't avoid his relatives when recommending talents.

416
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,250
I'm your wife, so you forced me out?

417
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,280
Okay.

418
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,750
I promise.

419
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,400
I'll notify the Publicity Department of it.

420
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Come on.

421
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,260
Sit down. Let me make coffee for you.

422
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,360
You know My Heart Flying?

423
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,190
No.

424
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,780
Li Xun joined it.

425
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,160
I don't know what he'll do.

426
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,260
He'd been imprisoned for three years.

427
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,100
What can he do?

428
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,970
The computer industry is always changing.

429
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,070
He can't catch up.

430
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,960
You're so unconfident of him?

431
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,460
Don't talk nonsense. I'm confident in you.

432
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,560
What's more, it's just a terrible company.

433
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,880
You don't need to keep an eye on it.

434
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,720
Who said I'll keep an eye on him?

435
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,270
Bye-bye.

436
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,110
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye,

437
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,680
I'm leaving.

438
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,370
Bye-bye.

439
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,140
See you tomorrow.

440
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,950
There must be something wrong with the one who works overtime.

441
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,380
- Colleague. 
 - You don't leave?

442
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,300
You had thrown it into the trash can. But now you still eat it?

443
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,040
Did I throw it away?

444
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,700
Okay.

445
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,170
There's a microwave oven. You can heat it.

446
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm leaving.

447
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,410
It doesn't taste bad.

448
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,060
Okay, just be colleagues.

449
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,080
You're also shirking here? Are you avoiding Group Leader?

450
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,830
I happened to buy two bottles.

451
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,440
I don't avoid her.

452
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,980
- It's not easy... 
 - Zhao Teng, did you go through the modification plan I gave you?

453
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,220
- Group Leader, I've just rested for a minute. 
 - Really?

454
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,210
This morning, you bought cigarettes, coffee, and finally water.

455
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,410
You've come out at least five times.

456
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,880
What is this?

457
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,830
If we want to lay a solid foundation for the "Invincible General",

458
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,930
    
 we need to do a lot of work.

459
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:02,260
It's intricate, so we must have a detailed work schedule.

460
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,090
This is a project schedule.

461
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,590
Work by the hour?

462
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,220
Don't be so detailed.

463
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,710
We must make a plan for every week, every day, or even every hour,

464
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,680
and spare enough flexible time.

465
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,750
Only by performing efficiently can we achieve our goals and spend less time on more work.

466
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,980
Well, another question.

467
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,690
Zhao Teng. Zhao Teng. Zhao Teng.

468
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,860
Zhu Yun. Zhu Yun. Zhu Yun.

469
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,230
Only us two have work?

470
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,000
What about him?

471
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,870
He's still studying.

472
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,860
Given my previous experience,

473
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,180
plans are always upset.

474
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,800
You can have a try.

475
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,020
I will.

476
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,490
Just be fair. Let's vote for it.

477
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,790
Okay, it's democratic.

478
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,150
- I agree. 
 - I object.

479
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,250
I agree.

480
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,240
The schedule is passed by two votes to one. It will be implemented this afternoon.

481
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,980
It's democratic. Anyway, I don't need to work.

482
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,450
Well, you don't need to work, so you certainly voted for it.

483
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay, you don't need to discuss it with me. Just suit yourself.

484
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,130
I can't go on.

485
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,540
Isn't this much better?

486
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,100
You haven't left?

487
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,620
You suffered because of Group Leader Zhu.

488
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,210
I'm indeed a little tired.

489
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,670
However, amazingly,

490
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,830
such a great modification is not a very tiring.

491
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,680
Why?

492
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,050
Because you didn't do more work at all.

493
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,130
I didn't do more work? It's impossible.

494
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,140
Actually, Zhu Yun didn't specially assign less work to you.

495
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,990
All your tasks had been assigned, but you still could finish them easily.

496
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,200
- Do you know why? 
 - Why?

497
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,680
Because she knows what you need to do every week, every day, or even every hour.

498
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,700
After making a rough plan, you won't deviate from the main direction.

499
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,690
Then you just need to add details.

500
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,030
How long have you known Zhu Yun?

501
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,580
Is she always so awesome?

502
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,300
Maybe.

503
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,050
Just follow Zhu Yun.

504
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,610
She'll surprise you.

505
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,300
I'm curious about something.

506
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,660
What's your relationship with Group Leader Zhu?

507
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,050
We don't have any relationship.

508
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,310
You don't have any relationship?

509
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:39,380
If you don't have any relationship, she required us to recruit you before joining us?

510
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,800
If you don't have any relationship, she took this task for you?

511
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,010
If you don't have any relationship, she paid you?

512
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,490
We're not fools.

513
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,460
Tell me. I won't tell others.

514
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,920
Because I'm handsome.

515
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,550
Okay?

516
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,610
Okay.

517
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,440
Xiaoxiao, let's go.

518
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,880
Watch out. The ground is slippery.

519
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,800
Why doesn't it work? It has limited-up by a little more than 3%.

520
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,230
Let me show you.

521
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,830
Only a little more than 3%? Didn't you say it would limit-up on at least two consecutive days?

522
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,450
It's lucky enough that it still can limit-up now.

523
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,630
- See you tomorrow. 
 - I'm leaving.

524
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,610
- This-This one will definitely limit up. 
 - Lend it to me.

525
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,040
Well, Li-Li Xun! You have an umbrella, haven't you?

526
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,460
Li Xun, where are you going?

527
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,810
It's none of your business.

528
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,230
Lend me your umbrella.

529
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,280
I'm going to the library for the work.

530
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,180
Where are you going? I can send you there.

531
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,940
No need.

532
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,630
Anyway, I'm a girl.

533
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,960
How could you refuse me?

534
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,380
Would you feel wronged under my umbrella?

535
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,180
Anyway, I'm also the group leader.

536
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,980
You should hold up the umbrella for your leader.

537
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,360
 He has gone to bed at 11:00? 

538
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,470
 Is it very late? 

539
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,000
 No. 

540
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,010
 Actually, it's common that the group leader calls his subordinate at night. 

541
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,680
Well, you're bold. You dared reject my call.

542
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,640
- Thanks for lending me umbrella yesterday. 
 - Place it in the company.

543
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,220
Why did you reject my call?

544
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,910
I called you at 11:00 last night but you rejected it.

545
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,570
Why did you reject my call?

546
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,860
Why did you call me?

547
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,800
For something.

548
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,820
Work!

549
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,500
Group Leader Zhu, our company has stipulated our working time. Right?

550
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,810
But you didn't have such a sense of time when you were a boss.

551
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,530
Listen up.

552
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,670
Our project is now at a critical moment,

553
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,820
so you need to be on call anytime.

554
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,800
I'm sorry.

555
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,010
I didn't know that was your call.

556
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,110
You don't have my phone number?

557
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,660
Your phone.

558
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,820
If you don't answer my call again, I will deduct your attendance.

559
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,800
   

560
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,410
Thank you.

561
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,740
You caught a cold?

562
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,920
I was caught in the rain yesterday.

563
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,560
Zhang Fang, the tissues are used up again. Can you be generous?

564
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,590
Here you are.

565
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,420
Thank you.

566
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,450
Isn't that my umbrella?

567
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,930
Why did you bring it here?

568
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,880
Isn't this Li Xun's umbrella?

569
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,040
That cub had held an umbrella after work yesterday

570
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,100
but still took mine away.

571
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,020
So I have a cold.

572
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,580
He doesn't work but still gets me in trouble.

573
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,400
Group Leader,

574
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,960
I have a cold.

575
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,440
Can I take a day off?

576
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,260
I wrote a sentence on the wall as a high school junior. Guess what I wrote.

577
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,940
What?

578
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,050
"As long as I'm still alive, I will continue to learn."

579
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,960
It's also for you.

580
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,860
Well, you're more horrible than Mr. Dong.

581
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,540
Are you Exploiter Zhu?

582
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,030
That's because you've never seen Exploiter Li.

583
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,860
I'll directly return the umbrella to Zhao Teng later.

584
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,210
Zhao Teng has finished building the framework, and I'm writing the storyline.

585
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,530
I'll send you the chronology of events of the Qin State. You add some details for me.

586
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,030
I'm busy.

587
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,680
I asked for leave this afternoon.

588
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,210
Where are you going?

589
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,850
This is my individual privacy.

590
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,450
You've left before I permit your leave.

591
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,470
Why does it crash again?

592
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,670
It's just a matter of getting used to it.

593
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,140
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

594
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,640
This model is good.

595
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,920
Titan is absolutely the top one.

596
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,420
How much is it?

597
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,970
How many do you want?

598
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,400
Two.

599
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,050
Flying Network!

600
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,020
Excuse me. Is Miss Zhu in?

601
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,660
Yes.

602
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,210
Your parcel.

603
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,090
Okay.

604
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,570
Titan.

605
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,350
CPU.

606
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,800
Memory bank.

607
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,140
Power supply.

608
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,050
Motherboard.

609
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,700
Let's do this.

610
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,080
You're assembling the host?

611
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,820
The positive and negative electrodes are connected reversely.

612
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,230
I'll help you.

613
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,210
No need.

614
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,780
Why are you here?

615
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,770
Came to fetch some materials.

616
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,440
You disassembled all the parts? I assembled them for more than an hour.

617
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,950
Did I also assemble other parts wrong?

618
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,290
No. I'm rearranging the wires.

619
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,800
What if you don't rearrange the wires?

620
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,550
It's ugly.

621
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,840
How is it? This is your privilege.

622
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,630
Work hard.

623
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,450
I'm going to wash my hands.

624
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,810
   

625
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,010
Titan.

626
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,300
You bought this?

627
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,570
A box of instant noodles.

628
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,170
What would you like for dinner?

629
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,860
You bought me the new equipment,

630
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,160
so I can treat you to dinner in return.

631
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,360
You treat me to dinner?

632
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,720
If you're not free, forget it.

633
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,710
Where are we going?

634
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:06,570


635
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,660
   

636
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,470
 Who? 

637
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,360
 Who? 

638
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,220
 Nobody. 

639
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,330
 I can move on. 

640
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,730
 Then why bother coming here? 

641
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,330
 I think you are jealous. 

642
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,700
 Have you ever thought that if we were together, 

643
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,280
 everything would be different now? 

644
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,770
 Can we make it up now? 

645
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,020
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

646
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,180
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

647
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:46,780
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

648
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,600
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

649
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,980
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

650
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:04,020
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

651
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:09,040
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

652
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,480
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

653
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,620
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

654
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:24,180
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

655
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,360
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

656
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,820
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

657

♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

658
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,500
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

664
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,380
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

665
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,480
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

666
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,960
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

667

♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

669
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,000
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

670
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,600
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

671
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:59,960
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫
