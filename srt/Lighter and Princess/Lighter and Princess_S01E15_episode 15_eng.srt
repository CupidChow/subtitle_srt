1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,700
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,560
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,040
   

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,060
Are you sure you won't use me anymore?

23
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,970
Why don't we have something in the canteen?

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,650
You're back.

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,530
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,990
Is he the ordinary student you mentioned?

27
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,390
This is Li Xun, my classmate.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,110
This is Tian Xiuzhu.

29
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,930
I won't have the meal with you in your canteen.

30
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,860
Invite me to dinner next time.

31
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,420
No problem. I'll go first.

32
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,170
Li Xun, wait for me.

33
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,890
Well.

34
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,080
What?

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,530
What's the project you just received about?

36
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,200
The integration system of the godown entries and outbound delivery orders of an automobile parts company.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,830
Is it difficult?

38
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,360
Forget it.

39
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,390
Why did you come back so early?

40
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,810
I had nothing to do at home, so I just came back to work.

41
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,910
You just paid me, so I should work harder.

42
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,740
Who was that man I saw?

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,760
My driver.

44
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,430
Driver?

45
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,850
Princess, do you need any help?

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,550
No, thanks. My luggage is not heavy, and it's near my—

47
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,520
Don't dawdle. After putting away your luggage, come to the base.

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,010
I should have kept Xiuzhu so that he could help me.

49
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,220
I said I didn't need your help,

50
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,170
but you actually ignored me.

51
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,080
Hello.

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,200
 What are you doing in the dormitory? Come to work now. 

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,320
Am I mad? Why did I come back voluntarily to suffer his maltreatment?

54
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,860
Come here to copy the documents and codes.

55
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,830
You look exhausted after coming back from putting away your luggage in the dormitory.

56
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,730
How delicate you are.

57
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,920
You are the boss. As long as you pay me, I dare not argue back.

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,230
Then come to work now.

59
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,520
I finally have a helper.

60
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,430
But we should observe the base rules.

61
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,290
It's not time to start school yet.

62
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,870
You have no reason to ask me to work for you.

63
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,890
This is malicious overtime.

64
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,230
Really?

65
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,230
I can work overtime, but you should have a good attitude.

66
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,230
I don't think you want to go on working here.

67
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,170
I'll satisfy your desire and give you a day off tomorrow.

68
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,460
Why?

69
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,570
You need to meet your driver.

70
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,430
Copy the documents and codes for me.

71
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,230
Do you have time?

72
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,440
He's not my driver.

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,060
He is the son of my mother's classmate.

74
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,730
Anything else?

75
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,710
I've known him since childhood.

76
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,620
When we were young, we competed to have chicken wings.

77
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,460
And then?

78
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,760
Then, then we vomited as we ate so much.

79
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,330
And then?

80
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,920
Then he went abroad. You know what happened then.

81
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,410
Is he that sunshine man who can paint?

82
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,480
Why do you remember him so clearly?

83
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,940
Are you satisfied?

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,300
Can you copy the documents and codes for me?

85
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,300
Zhu Yun,

86
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,990
if you dare to lie again,

87
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,680
you'll have to bear the consequences yourself.

88
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,530
Come and copy documents and codes.

89
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,080
What about the sunshine man?

90
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,380
If he has nothing to do, you can ask him to go back sooner.

91
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,110
Copy now.

92
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,460
What's up? Order dishes.

93
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,650
It's my treat today, so don't miss this chance.

94
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,040
You finally thought of me.

95
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,390
What do you mean?

96
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,130
Let me tell you.

97
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,660
Look! I can make money now,

98
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,320
so surely I should treat you to dinner.

99
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,150
How do you feel when spending the money you earned?

100
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,240
Do you have a strong sense of achievement?

101
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,190
My heart aches.

102
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,870
Tell me. What can I do for you?

103
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,810
I'm not treating you to dinner for something.

104
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,470
You are treating me to dinner in such a good restaurant,

105
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,920
but you don't want me to do anything for you?

106
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,560
Do you believe it?

107
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,200
I'm sincerely inviting you to dinner.

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,390
Just the two of us for dinner today. Order the dishes you like.

109
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,660
Okay.

110
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,300
I want this, Heart-Broken Watermelon.

111
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,250
- What's that? 
 - Watermelon juice.

112
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,380
It has a strange name. Seeing its high price, I know why it's called so.

113
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,060
Xiuzhu, go back and have a good rest after dinner.

114
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,090
I made a strategy for you. You can visit Lishan Mountain tomorrow.

115
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,070
I won't go with you.

116
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,970
Well, this is your purpose.

117
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,430
No, our university has an urgent task, or I wouldn't have come back so early.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,670
Is the urgent task related to your ordinary classmate?

119
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,350
Surely not.

120
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,270
I saw your ordinary classmate in the art museum last time.

121
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,980
Then, why didn't you say hello to us?

122
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,540
You usually look gentle and quiet, but you're actually a rather rebellious girl.

123
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,920
No.

124
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,020
Do you girls only like handsome men?

125
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,120
Unexpectedly, you're also a conformist.

126
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,870
So you also think he is handsome.

127
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,590
You're good at making deliberate misinterpretations.

128
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,610
Don't keep giggling like this, or you may have stiff plump cheeks.

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,140
I don't think he's reliable.

130
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,370
What do you mean by that?

131
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,500
I'll talk to you directly and openly.

132
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,450
He, a domineering man, lacks self-discipline.

133
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,350
You just met him a few times.

134
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,470
I don't want to warn you in the tone of your mom.

135
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,870
But I don't think he's suitable for you.

136
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,850
You can't change him.

137
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,290
Why should I change him?

138
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,520
Because you'll get hurt?

139
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you sure about it? You don't know him.

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,290
I don't know him, but I know you.

141
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,540
Xiuzhu, you really speak in the same way as my mom.

142
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,410
You think you know me well.

143
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,100
You don't like those people different from you.

144
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
You can't accept others' pasts

145
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,070
no matter whether their past is under their own control or not.

146
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,130
You just blame others from a commanding position only according to the rules in your own mind.

147
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,230
To tell you the truth, your behaviors are so unreasonable.

148
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,660
I hope I'm wrong.

149
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,590
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,100
It's I who should say sorry.

151
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,770
Thank you, Xiuzhu. Have a good time tomorrow.

152
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm sorry for what I just said.

153
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,760
Never mind. Go back quickly.

154
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,820
You should not rush to pay the bill. I said it was my treat.

155
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,290
It's mainly because this dinner is not big enough.

156
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,130
When you really make a lot of money, you must treat me to a big dinner.

157
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,120
That's a deal. I'll leave.

158
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,720
If my mom calls you, hide something for me.

159
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,280
I see.

160
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,210
Then I'll go back. Have fun tomorrow.

161
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,700
Bye-bye.

162
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,310
I'll leave.

163
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,020
Fang Shumiao.

164
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,130
I was looking for you.

165
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,500
Let me tell you. I met Mr. Lin.

166
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,840
He asked you to go to his office.

167
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,990
Why does he want to meet me?

168
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,690
There should be some good news.

169
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,760
He looked happy.

170
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,540
Why are you back at this time?

171
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,450
The Steering Committee of the Education Commission will come to listen to the class tomorrow.

172
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,830
I haven't hung the banner yet. I'll leave first.

173
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,740
By the way, I'm running for the Minister of Propaganda Department of the Student Union.

174
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,860
Remember to vote for me.

175
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,170
- Will you be promoted? 
 - Yes.

176
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,640
I've told you many times.

177
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,260
You're so thoughtless.

178
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,710
 Does he look happy? 

179
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,420
- What's up? 
 - Come here. Let her take part in it.

180
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,140
In what?

181
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,880
Let her go.

182
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,090
Wait.

183
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,280
What's the matter, Mr. Lin?

184
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,620
Next month, the preliminary of the Nanhu University Students' Information Security Competition

185
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
will be held at the Information Technology University.

186
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,190
Did you know?

187
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,590
It has attracted a lot of attention.

188
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,160
Surely.

189
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,680
Though this is the first competition,

190
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,640
it's a competitive event held among universities in the whole information security industry.

191
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,080
Normally, you freshmen are not qualified to participate.

192
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,640
The apps you designed have been well-recognized by them.

193
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,530
And they agreed and gave you a participation chance for the sake of me.

194
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,980
Many people sought but failed to get the chance.

195
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,170
I asked him to participate, but he declines with all sorts of excuses.

196
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,570
As the class rep, say something.

197
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,080
He should participate. He must participate.

198
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,590
If I participate in it, who can design the integration system of the godown entries and outbound delivery orders?

199
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,360
Don't place the unimportant before the important.

200
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,390
It won't take you much time to participate in it.

201
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,610
Gao Jianhong entered his name. He has the ability to handle it.

202
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,400
He can't go alone. All of you should participate.

203
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,260
- Including me? 
 - Sure.

204
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,890
Participating in the competition can not only broaden your horizons

205
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,920
but also enable you to communicate more

206
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,270
with the top industrial and academic experts and discover your weaknesses.

207
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,920
I don't need it.

208
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,740
What did you say?

209
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,960
I don't need it.

210
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,040
- You don't need it? 
 - Mr. Lin.

211
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,100
Well, you actually said so.

212
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,340
Do you think you don't have any weaknesses?

213
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,830
Yes.

214
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,230
Mr. Lin, if you want us to win prizes for the university

215
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,960
and make a show, I really don't think it's necessary.

216
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,600
Li Xun, how arrogant you are.

217
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,120
You're so opinionated.

218
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,100
 He left. How can I handle this? 

219
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,350
Listen. You...

220
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,330
Mr. Lin, calm down. Take a seat.

221
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,190
Take a seat. Take a seat.

222
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,590
I've seen many naughty students, and he's the unruliest one.

223
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes. He's to blame.

224
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,910
It's such a good chance.

225
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,400
The contestants are all top students in the country.

226
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,230
Even the sponsors are the most powerful enterprises in the industry.

227
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,490
After the award-winning works are announced,

228
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,870
they'll directly cooperate with those winners and have their work put to use.

229
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,250
After a long time of research on the base projects,

230
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,040
you've improved your professional ability.

231
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,010
It's time for you to show your real strength.

232
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,260
I know you are close to each other.

233
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,770
 Is our relationship exposed? 

234
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,870
You must persuade him to participate.

235
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,930
I'll try my best.

236
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,010
No, you must make it, or I'll take the blame on you.

237
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,950
I must make it.

238
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,850
He'll suffer a great deal because of his arrogance.

239
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,750
Zhu Yun, you are the class rep and the person he trusts.

240
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,870
You must control him for me.

241
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,290
Okay.

242
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,340
Li Xun.

243
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,090
Don't waste your time.

244
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,940
I know you, Talent Li, think it's meaningless to participate in the competition.

245
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,240
Others participate in the competition for learning,

246
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,940
but you, Top Scorer, just go there to broaden their horizons.

247
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,280
Just take our team to receive this test.

248
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,010
I know you're an excellent programmer,

249
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,010
but you should also pay attention to the overall improvement of the team.

250
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,480
Don't speak to me in the way of Fang Shumiao.

251
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,400
Political Commissar Zhu, don't try to persuade me.

252
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,870
   

253
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,750
Take it away.

254
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,210
You may not participate in the competition, but this is a very interesting forum.

255
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,790
Xinchuan Company specializes in the systems of dock godown entries and outbound delivery orders.

256
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,750
So?

257
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,310
So we can go and discover their bugs.

258
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,300
Do you agree?

259
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,360
No, I won't go.

260
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,210
I won't take it away.

261
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,910
Touch-typing,

262
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,230
touch-test, and touch-setting of breaking points.

263
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,390
Are you a god?

264
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,530
Mr. Lin managed to win a participation chance for us,

265
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,930
so you may at least participate in the forum. If so, he'll be very delighted.

266
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,900
You're so double-faced.

267
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
What are you doing?

268
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,720
Come with me.

269
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,850
Li Xun, accompany me to the forum. Okay?

270
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,720
What's the weather like next month?

271
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,700
 He agreed. 

272
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,020
Don't be so nervous.

273
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,000
This is the preliminary.

274
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Are you afraid that your work won't enter the final?

275
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,960
I want to learn more from you, so that I can feel at ease.

276
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,030
Extreme nervousness will disturb your psychological state before the competition.

277
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,060
Relax yourself.

278
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,420
I often blame Li Xun for his arrogance.

279
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,580
But you really should learn from him sometimes.

280
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,420
He's very confident.

281
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,900
No matter what you young people do, you must have confidence in yourselves.

282
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,550
Mr. Lin, since I've decided to participate in the competition,

283
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,910
I won't take it lightly.

284
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,810
I want to prove my ability.

285
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,820
I can feel your confidence from that.

286
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,800
What is your topic?

287
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,960
Switch-based LAN ARP Attack Defense System.

288
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,200
   

289
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,800
It's of a certain difficulty.

290
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,150
- How long have you been preparing it? 
 - Two days.

291
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,290
No way!

292
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,550
Actually, it's been a while.

293
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,780
I usually sort out some data and collect some questions about this topic.

294
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,900
I intended to use it as material for my graduation thesis.

295
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,080
Good topic.

296
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,490
It should be a byway with practicability.

297
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,150
Remember. Opportunity favors the prepared.

298
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,340
Hello?

299
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,650
Yes, we're here.

300
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,350
We'll come to you in half an hour.

301
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,010
Okay, see you later.

302
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,200
Old Gao, go in first.

303
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,270
Help Zhu Yun and me register our names.

304
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,070
Where-Where will you go?

305
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll go and meet the leader of Xinda Biotechnology.

306
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,280
They've always wanted to talk to me about the development of the biological database.

307
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,180
Did you agree to come here because of Xinda Biotechnology's interview?

308
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,670
Or else?

309
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,450
You're abusing the public trust.

310
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,290
What is Princess talking about?

311
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,110
Which side are you on?

312
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,090
Don't forget you're my team member.

313
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,450
See you later.

314
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,160
- Please help me carry my suitcase. Thank you. 
 - I'm leaving. 
 - Your book.

315
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,250
   

316
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,870
   

317
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,730
-  Hi, which university are you from? 
 - Nanhu University.

318
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,970
   

319
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,920
Nanhu University. In Zone 2.

320
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,180
It's through that door.

321
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,090
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

322
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,950
 Hi, which university are you from? 

323
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,650
 - Well, okay. How many of you are there? 
 - One. 

324
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,310
 Okay. Okay. 

325
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,090
Give him one room card.

326
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,640
Okay.

327
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,200
Hello. I'm Gao Jianhong from Nan...

328
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,100
Are you from Nanhu University?

329
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,150
Hello, I'm Xu Lina from the Computer Science Department of this university.

330
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm also a freshman.

331
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,920
Gao Jianhong.

332
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,020
You should have another two members, Li Xun and Zhu Yun.

333
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,710
Haven't they come?

334
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,340
They aren't participating in the competition but are just attending the forum.

335
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,510
Okay. Yeah.

336
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,270
How do you know about us?

337
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,100
I'm also a contestant.

338
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,720
Blue Crown app is a typical teaching case in our circles.

339
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,760
- Did you design it? 
 - Yes.

340
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,370
You guys are so awesome.

341
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,270
As freshmen, you have your representative works

342
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,380
and can participate in such a high-level competition.

343
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,040
Today, I've just received a small number of undergraduates, let alone freshmen.

344
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,640
It's mainly because we have good teachers.

345
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,760
What's up?

346
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,910
You're both talented and modest,

347
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,880
much better than the boys in our university.

348
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,190
Go and have your formalities handled first.

349
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,570
Let's talk later.

350
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,300
- Okay. 
 - Give him two room cards.

351
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,280
Okay.

352
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,040
Hi, which university are you from?

353
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,030
Hengjiang University. Two members. Give him two room cards, too.

354
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,680
Okay.

355
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,450
   
 Are you free tonight? 

356
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,860
   
 Let's go out for dinner. 

357
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,260
 Emphasize which room everyone lives in. 

358
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,740
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay. Thank you. 

359
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,780
Well, we've almost finished all the work.

360
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,010
Thank you so much.

361
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,680
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

362
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,780
Sorry to keep you waiting.

363
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,940
Never mind. I just got here.

364
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,500
I booked a restaurant. Let's go for dinner.

365
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,580
Then I'll call a taxi.

366
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,750
No need. Follow me.

367
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,620
Please come again. Bye.

368
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,620
Miss Xu, we've reserved your seats for you. Still your favorite dinning place.

369
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,010
- Okay, thank you. 
 - This way.

370
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,480
This way, please.

371
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,370
- Please have a seat. 
 - Thank you.

372
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,630
- Please. 
 - Okay.

373
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,310
Sit down, please.

374
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,130
It's such a formal occasion.

375
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,700
I should have worn my only suit.

376
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,380
- Although my classmates all think... 
 - Please drink some water.

377
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,130
Thanks.

378
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,160
Although they all think I'm quite like a real estate agent in that suit.

379
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,030
Really? I also want to see you wear it.

380
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,480
Actually, it's not that formal here.

381
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,100
People are dressed differently.

382
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,040
If you dressed formally,

383
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,300
I'd have thought you were here to take photos and share them on your Moments.

384
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,730
Look at the two girls over there.

385
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,670
Do you want me to take some photos for you?

386
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,250
All right.

387
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,710
Good.

388
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,000
Good.

389
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,960
Let me see.

390
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,750
They look terrible. I'm deformed in the photo.

391
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,350
It seems I'm only 1.2 meters high in this one. Look at this one.

392
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,270
I feel as if the Oriental Pearl Tower grew on my head.

393
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,360
I see. I look sort of sentimental in this one.

394
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,610
No matter how beautiful the scenery is, it's just the background.

395
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,320
I'll take some more for you.

396
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,310
Make me look taller.

397
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,620
One more.

398
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,490
Let me see.

399
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,600
These look much better.

400
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,300
Let's take a selfie.

401
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,780
Stand closer to me.

402
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,110
Three, two, one.

403
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,510
The last two look good. Quite good.

404
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,310
Hello. Here are our menus.

405
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,670
Thank you.

406
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,680
This one also looks good.

407
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,770
Don't look.

408
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,180
The one you took is the lady's menu, with no price on it.

409
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,770
How does it taste?

410
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,420
Delicious.

411
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,580
Cheers!

412
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,330
If we can write codes in such a beautiful place later, we'll work efficiently.

413
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,800
Good idea. You should try the next time.

414
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Then we would become the center of attention in the Bund.

415
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,900
Your great god Li Xun, why haven't I seen him?

416
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,340
Are you looking for him?

417
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,720
It's said he is the leader in the design of the Blue Crown app.

418
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,080
He established our practice base. Blue Crown is our project.

419
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,160
I downloaded and browsed your app.

420
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,290
Besides good practicability, I also like your idea "Click to Check the Illness Reasons and Treatment."

421
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,070
It's a particularly interesting design.

422
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,120
"Click to Check the Illness Reasons and Treatment." Good name.

423
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,300
To tell you the truth, I'm actually bad at programming.

424
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
Stop kidding me.

425
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,870
The Computer Science Department of your university ranks at the top among peers.

426
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,210
But I was enrolled as a special student with folk dance talent.

427
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,920
I applied for this program on sudden impulse.

428
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,750
I'm not good at math.

429
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,170
I can hardly understand my courses.

430
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,770
Can you understand me?

431
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,140
You're so modest. You're also a contestant.

432
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,300
My classmates all look down on me.

433
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,410
They all think I'm an art student, so they don't want to complete the group homework with me.

434
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,470
I just want to take a place in this competition and show my real strength to them.

435
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,500
How did you think of the idea of that app?

436
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,830
Can you tell me about it?

437
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,100
Are you curious about it?

438
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,360
   

439
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,410
Shopping websites have just emerged in recent years.

440
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,500
There're diversified shopping websites,

441
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,780
but in fact, it won't take so long

442
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,310
before most of the resources are slowly gathered into several large platforms.

443
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,300
Second, smartphones have become popular.

444
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,980
The reason why we gave up designing large websites

445
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,080
and chose to design apps was because large websites are wide in usage,

446
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,890
while apps stress fine functions.

447
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,370
We aim to design deep and fine app functions to meet the needs and usage habits of users.

448
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,470
In the future, apps must have a lower usage threshold than websites.

449
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,670
Why?

450
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,300
Because all of us who carry mobile phones can use those apps at any time,

451
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,800
but we can't use computers so conveniently.

452
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Therefore, we added the illness search system based on different user portraits.

453
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,820
Users don't need to know their illness names.

454
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,660
They can obtain the corresponding information and treatment as soon as they enter their symptoms.

455
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,170
Second, we added the Mocap system.

456
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,700
Mocap?

457
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,360
Yes, it's the Mocap system.

458
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,110
It's widely used in many Hollywood blockbusters.

459
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,880
Our model is also based on this technology,

460
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,060
which is more intuitive than the entered symptoms. Right?

461
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,210
What do you think of it?

462
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,070
Very good, Old Gao. It sounds really great.

463
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,080
It still has many shortcomings.

464
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,390
It's already quite perfect. You're so modest.

465
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,030
I've talked so much today.

466
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,580
No, tell me more about it.

467
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,310
You want to hear more?

468
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,300
Although smartphones haven't been fully popularized yet

469
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,400
and the mobile internet speed can't meet the current requirements...

470
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,310
Here we are.

471
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,340
Old Gao, you're sure to win this information security competition.

472
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,120
Thank you.

473
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,860
Well, I'll go first.

474
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,710
Go back and get some rest early. Good night.

475
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,920
Bye-bye.

476
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,820
Good night.

477
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,310
You're back.

478
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,770
Did you have a smooth talk with Xinda Biotechnology?

479
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,370
Yes.

480
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,790
 Here are our photos. 

481
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:39,090
 Don't play with your phone while driving. Tell me when you get home. 

482
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,330
   

483
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,570
Who?

484
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,030
 Old Gao, it's me. 

485
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,860
I'm coming.

486
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,750
Old Gao, what are you doing?

487
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Coming, coming.

488
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,630
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

489
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,700
May I come in?

490
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,400
Yes.

491
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,200
Only you?

492
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,700
Yes.

493
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,500
Did you have breakfast?

494
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,400
I don't have the habit of eating breakfast.

495
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,800
Old Gao, can you check my project?

496
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Sure. As long as you don't mind.

497
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,700
I'll treat you to these sweet-scented osmanthus cakes.

498
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
It tastes good.

499
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,700
It's good, right?

500
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,300
It's the specialty of Lübolang Restaurant.

501
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,400
Surely it's delicious.

502
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
    
 Look.

503
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,200
This is our software piracy self-discovery system,

504
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,000
and this is the feature extractor.

505
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,600
Look.

506
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
What do you think?

507
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,400
Very good. The topic anti-piracy is good.

508
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,700
I didn't expect it.

509
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,400
Really?

510
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,600
Yours is much better than ours.

511
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,400
What's your topic?

512
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,100
Our topic is...

513
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,300
Let me introduce you.

514
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,200
This is Li Xun.

515
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,800
Hello, Li Xun. I'm Xu Lina.

516
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,300
I've long heard your name.

517
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,200
Sorry to disturb you.

518
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,900
Li Xun, could you check the project of our group

519
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,100
and see if there's something that needs to be improved?

520
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,600
Look!  This is our software piracy self-discovery system and its principle...

521
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
This isn't your work.

522
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Li Xun.

523
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,000
How do you know?

524
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,200
There're only two principles for software companies to detect piracy.

525
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,300
First, to use the embedded digital watermarking.

526
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,100
Second, to capture information when software is updated and connected to the internet.

527
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,100
You adopted the second principle,

528
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,900
but both of them are of no use.

529
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,500
The information can be captured on the premise that your software can directly access the internal data of files

530
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,100
related to the C disk operating system across Windows operating system permissions.

531
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,000
But the personal security and firewall functions of Windows operating system are strong.

532
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,600
At present, many Chinese companies use PPPoE Internet.

533
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,100
The IP address of the external network changes on a regular basis.

534
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,300
However, MAC can only be displayed only after the SNMP service is enabled and it's uploaded.

535
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,000
The rest interact by port number.

536
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,700
Don't make a fool of yourself.

537
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,500
Li Xun, it's enough.

538
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,300
Li Xun, can our project be improved?

539
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
Others may see it easily.

540
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,600
Find good programmers to redo it.

541
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
Let them change the idea and do it according to the first principle,

542
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,300
which is easier than the improvement of your current project.

543
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,900
Wait!

544
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,200
Can you repeat the first idea you just told me?

545
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Sorry, I'm very busy.

546
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Can I come to consult you next time?

547
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,800
After I redo it, can you give me some advice?

548
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,800
No. This isn't my duty.

549
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,800
My name is Xu Lina.

550
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm from Class 132 of the Software Engineering Major at Information Technology University.

551
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,800
He just speaks in this way. Don't take it to heart.

552
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,100
He's really a top programmer.

553
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,600
   

554
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
   
 Hello, everyone. 

555
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,600
   
 Welcome to our Information Technology University. 

556
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,100
   
 Thank you for your participation and support. 

557
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,800
 The organizing committee of the competition received the works 

558
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,200
 submitted by more than 300 contestants from universities across the country. 

559
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,400
 After three days of selection, 14 works were selected to enter the final. 

560
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,300
 Well, see. 

561
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:06,200
 They are the team and individual contestants who entered the final in this competition. 

562
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,500
 Congratulations. 

563
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,400
In half a month, you'll come back here to fight it out.

564
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Now I announce the official launch

565
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,700
of the Jianguang Electronics Cup First Nanhu University Students' Information Security Competition.

566
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,800
 Let's welcome the leaders of Huake Technology Co., Ltd. 

567
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,100
and Fang Zhijing, who won the Special Attention Award in this competition,

568
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:43,200
to come to the stage and press the crystal ball with us.

569
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Thanks. Thanks.

570
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Come on. One, two, three!

571
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Come on. One, two, three!

572
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,500
Cheese!

573
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,300
- Well, one more.
 - Okay.

574
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,900
One, two, three. Cheese!

575
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
Okay. Okay. Okay.

576
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,200
- Is it good? 
 - May I have your WeChat account?

577
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,600
We'll establish a final communication group.

578
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,100
I'll invite you to join it.

579
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,600
- See you in the final. 
 - See you in the final.

580
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,000
 See you in the final. 

581
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,800
 - Establish a group. 
 - Okay. Bye-bye. 

582
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,000
Senior, may I have your WeChat account?

583
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,200
Okay.

584
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
Scan my QR code.

585
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,500
The project of your group is impressive.

586
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,200
Only you won the Special Attention Award.

587
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,600
Thank you.

588
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,400
Which university are you from? I can make a note.

589
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,600
I'm from Nanhu University.

590
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Nanhu University?

591
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,600
Is Li Xun from your university?

592
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,400
Yes. We designed the Blue Crown app together.

593
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,100
Is this also your common project?

594
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,800
He didn't participate in this project.

595
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
It's my own design.

596
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,300
- Fang, let's go. 
 - Okay.

597
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,100
Let's talk later.

598
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,800
 Come on. 

599
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
 One, two, three. 

600
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,900
 Is it good?  Is this okay? 

601
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,400
 Yes. Thank you. 

602
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,800
 Not at all. 

603
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
- Old Gao. 
 - Congratulations.

604
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
Thank you.

605
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,600
Congratulations.

606
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,300
Thank you.

607
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,900
Where's Li Xun?

608
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,200
He must be busy with something.

609
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,400
He's so busy.

610
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,000
No wonder when I requested him on WeChat he still hasn't accepted.

611
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,000
How did you get his WeChat account?

612
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,700
Don't forget. I'm a volunteer.

613
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,400
Old Gao, can you tell him and have him accept my request.

614
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,800
Okay.

615
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll invite you to have dinner tonight.

616
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,100
- I'll invite some of the finalists to celebrate together. 
 - Okay.

617
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,400
Be sure to let Li Xun join us.

618
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,800
He helped me a lot this time.

619
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
I should thank him sincerely.

620
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,600
- I'll try my best. 
 - Okay.

621
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:28,100


622
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,700
   

623
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,800
 Fang Zhijing. 

624
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,400
 It's you who plagued Xiaoyan. 

625
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,000
 You caused her to be slandered by others for a recommendation certificate. 

626
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,400
 She killed herself because of you. 

627
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
 - It's you who killed her— 
 - Zhu Yun. 

628
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,200
 It's because she had psychological problems. 

629
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,000
 - Join me in the competition to beat this project. 
  - Not enough. 

630
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,500
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

631
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,200
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

632
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,200
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

633
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,290
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

634
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,600
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

635
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,000
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

636
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,100
♫  We will not separate  ♫

637
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,100
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

638
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,600
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

639
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,600
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

640
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:45,800
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

641
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,400
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

642
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,900

649
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,700
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

650
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,600
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

651
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,500
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

652
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,000
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

653
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,300
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

654
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,800
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

655
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,000
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

656
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,600
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

657
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:22,200
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

658
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,800
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

659
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,200
♫  True love will take its course ♫

660
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,800
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

661
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,000
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

662
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,500
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

663

♫  True love will take its course  ♫

664
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,400
♫  That hot firework  ♫

665
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:04,200
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

666
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,900
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

667
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,500
