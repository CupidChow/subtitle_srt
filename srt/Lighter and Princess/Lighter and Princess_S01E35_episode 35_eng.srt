22

23
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,800
I have already thought about the title:

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,350
"Boss of L&amp;P Stealthily Has an Affair with the Female Executive of Rival Company

25
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,510
Employing Male Beauty Calculations to Obtain Game Source Code."

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,800
What do you think about this title?

27
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,740
Do you know Xu Lina is an online celebrity with tens of millions of fans?

28
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,840
If I share this video by using her TikTok account

29
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
to accuse me of fornicating with Zhu Yun,

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,940
what do you think Zhu Yun will be?

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,340
What's that word?

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,850
Social Death.

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,540
Go tell Li Xun to think it over.

34
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,170
I am dying,

35
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,400
so I don't care about any scandals,

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
but Zhu Yun is different.

37
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,460
Does he want Zhu Yun to be discredited?

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,590
I'm not afraid of taking revenge at the expense of my life again,

39
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,560
and I can stand up again after falling down,

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,430
but she is different.

41
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,020
I've always wanted to be the master of my destiny.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,340
I always thought this was what I wanted to pursue.

43
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,860
Isn't it?

44
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,250
Then, what do you want?

45
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,710
Hello, Miaomiao.

46
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,900
 Zhu Yun, Li Xun has decided to drop the case. 

47
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,340
When?

48
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,500
 Just now. 

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,270
So suddenly. You've reached an agreement?

50
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,440
 Zhu Yun, be strong. 

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,500
 I sent you a video. 

52
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,810
Come in.

53
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,740
Mr. Gao, the directors of the Publicity Department,

54
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,390
Public Relations Department, and Marketing Department have all applied for resignation.

55
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,520
They do so to disgrace me.

56
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't worry. Let them go.

57
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,740
Dongliang, manage the Development Department well.

58
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,940
A few backbones can't be lost.

59
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,350
You also want to leave?

60
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,010
Mr. Gao, I've worked for you since graduation.

61
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,300
When you plagiarized ideas from and undermined those small companies,

62
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,320
I always told myself it is the rule of this world, and the law of jungle is correct.

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,920
But now I think you are too extreme.

64
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,750
What a good excuse!

65
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,670
What do you think now?

66
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,170
L&amp;P is being sued, so you're afraid and want to leave.

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,370
If you were really virtuous, why didn't you leave when L &amp; P made profits?

68
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,910
You want to leave because you think a company that can't go public is unprofitable, don't you?

69
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,440
Now you're all stung by conscience?

70
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,900
Go. You go.

71
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,510
You all can go. I don't need you.

72
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,380
Li Xun can climb the mountain alone. Me too!

73
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,350
I'll go on fighting against him!

74
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,760
 Mr. Gao, a lady wants to see you. I can't stop her. 

75
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,280
   

76
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,450
 What would you like to drink? 

77
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,650
 No need. 

78
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,560
 Coffee, okay? 

79
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,220
 Just get straight to the point. 

80
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,560
 You can't beat Old Gao. 

81
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,080
 You want to persuade us to give up? 

82
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,110
 No, I want cooperation. 

83
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,800
 You should persuade Gao Jianhong but not us. 

84
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,350
 I'm leaving. 

85
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,980
 I'm sorry. 

86
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,310
 I have new clothes here. How about wearing my clothes? 

87
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,380
 No need. 

88
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,490
 How can you get out in this? 

89
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,410
 You wear my clothes and return them to me another day. 

90
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,980
 No need. 

91
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,660
Who can prove that this video is true?

92
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,550
Do you think I would make such a stupid mistake?

93
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,000
You can authenticate it.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,230
This video is not edited at all.

95
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,750
Really? Send it to me.

96
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,610
Gao Jianhong, you rat.

97
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,960
I learned it from Li Xun.

98
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,980
Doesn't he always have a backhand?

99
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,290
Zhu Yun, so many years have passed.

100
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,320
You can also see whether Li Xun can't let go of himself or you.

101
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,770
I also want to see...

102
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,590
whether he really cares about someone.

103
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,400
For this war, you have involved so many people,

104
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,440
including I, Xu Lina, and you.

105
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,630
Is it worth it?

106
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,390
Yes.

107
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,180
Before I die,

108
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,110
I must defeat him once.

Hey, guys. Is this Zhu Yun?

129
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,060
Come to check it.

130
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,800
What's wrong?

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,000
Really?

132
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's now the 5th trending topic.

133
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,100
Look, thousands of comments. And hundreds of netizens have shared it.

134
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,300
Look. A netizen even shared a group photo of them.

135
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
So clear.

136
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,800
So, Zhu Yun's words were true.

137
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,700
Back then they had a feud and Li Xun beat someone.

138
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,600
Here. Here. Here.

139
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,400
"Let me add something. These three are my alumni.

140
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,900
At that time, the woman was with the man on the right.

141
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,300
Later, the man on the right was imprisoned for blinding someone.

142
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,000
Finally, the woman and the boss of L &amp; P got together.

143
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,700
Exactly the same.

144

145
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,400
 Look at Weibo!

Li Xun.

149
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Are you drunk?

150
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,400
Why did you do it?

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
I promised to reconcile with them.

152
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
I hate being threatened.

153
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,200
Why didn't you ask me before you made a decision?

154
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I don't care about non-existent things.

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,900
Even if the whole world misunderstands me, I'm not afraid.

156
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,300
I'm willing.

157
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,200
But I'm not.

158
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
I don't want our efforts to be wasted in vain.

159

You can't bow your head.

160
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,500
I don't allow.

161
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,700
Why is it in vain?

162
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Bringing you back to me,

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,900
was worth it.

164
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
What did you say?

165
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,700
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

166
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,000
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

167
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,400
♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

168
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,000
♫  Have you ever changed?  ♫

169
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,400
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

170
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,800
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

171
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,200
♫  It's been so long ago  ♫

172
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,200
♫  I've been walking so long  ♫

173
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Where are you going?

174
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,200
Some words can't be said after drinking.

175
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
Something...

176
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,200
can't be done after drinking.

177
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Are you sober now?

178
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,100
It's too late to ask this.

179
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,100
Morning.

180
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,700
 Is this a reconciliation? 

181
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,000
 Getting back together. Parting but longing for each other. 

182
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,100
 But Li Xun is not such a lingering person. 

183
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,000
 That process is too informal. 

184
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,500
 Does what he said last night count? 

185
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,500
 Zhu Yun, don't think about those things about love. 

186
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,100
 Career is first. 

187
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,500
 You're just ordinary colleagues. 

188
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
 You can do it. Fighting. 

189
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
You're awake.

190
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
I had a drink the day before,

191
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,600
so my brain was a little slow the next day.

192
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,000
Zhu Yun,

193
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,300
I've never confessed to anyone.

194
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,700
I used to like someone,

195
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,100
but I also tried to find a way to take the initiative to let her come to the me by herself.

196
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,200
I don't have so much energy now,

197
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,600
and we've known each other for a long time,

198
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,600
so I'll get straight to the point.

199
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,600
Just like how you loved me in the past,

200
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,300
in the future,

201
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,300
will you still want to be with me again?

202
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,910
I know it might not be a good time for me to ask you.

203
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,700
- But if you feel... 
 - Yes!

204
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,100
Yes!

205
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,700
Yes!

206
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,600
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

207
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,500
Yes.

208
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Li Xun, I want to be with you.

209
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,100
Let's make up.

210
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
That's all?

211
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,100
Princess, can you be a little reserved?

212
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,700
♫  When I fly across the top of the clouds  ♫

213
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,500
♫  The sound of th wind is in my ear  ♫

214
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,100
♫  I sigh when meeting you  ♫

215
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,700
It turns out that it's so simple...

216
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,000
to confess.

217
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,600
But I don't suffer a loss because I won you back.

218
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:37,200
Did you think your image as my ordinary colleague was well formed?

219
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Yep.

220
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Do you know you had long given yourself away?

221
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
Really?

222
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,000
If you didn't take the initiative, you were afraid that I would reject you,

223
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,600
and you would not even be able to be a colleague. Right?

224
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,200
♫  Because I'm falling for you  ♫

225
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
♫  I don't want it to be true  ♫

226
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
♫  Pull me along to fly against the wind  ♫

227
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
Actually, you didn't need to be afraid.

228
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,800
If you asked...

229
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
or mentioned it,

230
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,300
I'd have promised you.

231
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,200
♫  No matter how high or how far ♫

232
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
♫ You are on the other side  ♫

233
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,900
♫  bravely accompanying me to take risks  ♫

234
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,100
♫  Because I'm falling for you  ♫

235
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,700
Hello, Lawyer Fang. This is L &amp; P's legal counsel.

236
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,600
Well, the last time we met we were in a hurry and there were a lot of details that we hadn't finished talking about.

237
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,400
So we want to talk to Mr. Li Xun again.

238
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Lawyer Fang, what time is convenient for you?

239
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
 We talked clearly last time, didn't we? 

240
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
 Mr. Li disagreed with the settlement. 

241
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,300
Lawyer Fang, well, we are willing to give you 50 million yuan.

242
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,400
You must be entrusted with many cases,

243
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,900
so you know this price can't be negotiated anywhere.

244
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,100
 Okay. I'll ask him. 

245
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,400
 Mr. Li agrees. But he only wants to talk with Mr. Gao alone. 

246
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,610
   

247
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Let's go.

248
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,660
Do you agree with the settlement?

249
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,850
If you agree, we can discuss the compensation amount.

250
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,530
Don't drag it out.

251
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,430
Now L &amp; P is at a weak state.

252
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,810
You can add more bargaining chips.

253
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,190
Once the review period has passed,

254
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,210
no matter what the result,

255
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,150
I can't agree to reconciliation.

256
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,940
If we're both exhausted to the end, the fish will die and the net will break.

257
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,760
Nothing will come to you cheap.

258
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,870
Are you convinced?

259
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,900
Gao Jianhong,

260
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,630
tell me whether you're convinced.

261
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,290
Do you remember our last meeting here?

262
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,950
Have you been happy keeping your eyes on me during this time?

263
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,290
Is it comfortable to stumble and fall?

264
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,840
It's okay for you to use me as a weathervane, but mountain climbers...

265
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,950
must not forget how high the mountain is.

266
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,820
You haven't beaten me once since the day we met.

267
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,720
Whether a campus exam, off-campus project,

268
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,580
system software or even a small game, you've never won.

269
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,500
It was impossible to defeat me before.

270
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,100
In the future,

271
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,200
it will still be impossible.

272
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,860
I gave you a chance to make a choice,

273
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,430
but you chose to fight against me.

274
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,190
If you want to reconcile, we can

275
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,330
but you must tell me...

276
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,320
whether you regret or not.

277
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,550
Tell me whether you regret or not!

278
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,450
No!

279
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,910
Okay.

280
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,000
You said you didn't regret it, I still think highly of you.

281
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,180
Do you remember you told me this.

282
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,150
I can't climb the mountain alone.

283
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,350
You now remember this sentence.

284
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,860
I'm not climbing the mountain alone.

285
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,180
What's wrong with you, Old Gao?

286
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,420
Old Gao!

287
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,360
Are you all right?

288
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,310
Is there anyone outside? Somebody!

289
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,350
- Is there anyone outside? 
 - What's wrong?

290
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,270
- Mr. Gao. 
 - Mr. Gao.

291
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,240
Mr. Gao, are you all right? Mr. Gao!

292
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,930
- Call an ambulance. Hurry up. 
 - Mr. Gao.

293
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,180
- Are you all right, Mr. Gao? 
 - Mr. Gao.

294
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,880
   

295
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,520
 I don't know. Why did he suddenly get a nosebleed? 

296
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,920
 Don't be anxious. Go back to work. 

297
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,730
 Go. Go. Go. 

298
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,950
When Hou Ning said you were not at home, I guessed you would be here.

299
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,480
Why doesn't he regret?

300
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,480
Tell me.

301
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,190
Why he doesn't regret?

302
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,900
He hates me so much that...

303
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,860
he is willing to die to beat me.

304
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,520
He's so stupid.

305
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,150
How can he defeat me?

306
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,800
He knows.

307
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,190
He knows it all.

308
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,760
He knows my strength better than anyone else.

309
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,340
Why did he push himself to this point?

310
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,640
Gao Jianhong's illness is not your fault.

311
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,290
Isn't it?

312
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,400
Today, I suddenly understood Old Gao.

313
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,050
Maybe he, like me, has had an endless vicious cycle of days.

314
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,350
All three of us have been cornered by the same thing.

315
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,290
You were isolated by steel bars.

316
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,220
The two of us outside; one of us chose to escape,

317
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,000
while the other chose to go all the way to black.

318
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,250
What do you mean?

319
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,770
Say what you want to say.

320
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,660
Don't let me guess like before.

321
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,730
I don't want to guess now.

322
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,000
Are you on his side too?

323
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,050
If I hound him to death,

324
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,190
what would you think of me?

325
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,290
It's finally calm.

326
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,390
You're awake.

327
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,520
Why are you here?

328
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,390
Can't I be here?

329
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,660
Eat something first.

330
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,890
Have some porridge.

331
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,050
Minced Pork Porridge with Preserved Egg.

332
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,720
I cooked it.  Have a taste.

333
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,570
You...

334
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,380
I got a refund for my ticket. I'll stay with you for your surgery.

335
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,360
No need.

336
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,220
Somebody needs to sign it.

337
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:45,360
Lina, I'm most afraid of this, you staying out of sympathy.

338
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,200
You have your own life.

339
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,870
Who said I sympathized with you?

340
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,640
When we got married, there was this passage:

341
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:04,400
For richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health.

342
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,350
I said, "I do."

343
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,600
I just don't want to break the promise I made.

344
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,950
We're divorced.

345
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,090
Not yet.

346
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,980
The surgery is tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

347
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,740
These are the dos and don'ts.

348
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,710
Doctor, is the success rate of this surgery high?

349
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:33,180
Mrs. Gao, as Mr. Gao had been procrastinating the surgery,

350
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,350
his condition deteriorated quickly.

351
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,240
You have to be mentally prepared.

352
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,400
When you used to lead us to do things, you always stared at the widest and most accurate road.

353
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
but now you only kept an eye on Gao Jianhong.

354
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
He doesn't deserve you.

355
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,600
Don't you want to knock him down?

356
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,400
I used to think that knocking him down was the most important thing,

357
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,000
but now I think your future and development are more important.

358
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:34,600
The other day I saw you working on a VR report for Oculus after getting off work and working on a new search algorithm.

359
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,200
but you didn't continue.

360
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,100
Because you were only thinking about dealing with Gao Jianhong and you didn't have time.

361
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
I hate Fang Zhijing.

362
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,400
I hate Gao Jianhong more.

363
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,300
I hate them taking L &amp; P.

364
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,200
I hate them for betraying us.

365
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I hate them to death.

366
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,600
But I'm more afraid of you getting stuck in a muddy field.

367
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,900
 Good night. 

368
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,700
Lina.

369
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,200
If my surgery is a success,

370
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,200
let's go on honeymoon.

371
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
We can.

372
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,200
Why don't we just sell the house and study abroad together?

373
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,700
Let's apply to Imperial College to get a degree together.

374
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Let's go like you planned when you left university.

375
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,000
Hasn't it always been your dream to go to Imperial College?

376
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,600
I've forgotten it all.

377
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,700
It turns out that this was my real dream.

378
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,300
Li Xun, Xu Lina was right.

379
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,100
Hating someone is not worth the price after so long.

380
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,500
The rivers and lakes are not big, the circle is small.

381
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,200
Sooner or later we will fight again.

382
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,300
Zhu Yun,

383
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,900
why did we become like this?

384
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,600
Do you still remember what Li Xun said?

385
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:40,900
Everything is the same as it was in the beginning.

386
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,200
The further you go, the more you deviate.

387
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,000
The patient Gao Jianhong will be operated by Director Liang today, right?

388
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yes.

389
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,100
Did he fast for 12 hours and not drink anything for 4 hours before the surgery?

390
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,200
No, he hasn't anything to eat or drink.

391
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,840
Okay. Wait a moment.

392
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,330
We'll take you in a moment.

393
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,300
Okay, thank you.

394
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,300
Lina,

395
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,500
I want to see someone.

396
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,470
   

397
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,300
Zhu Yun.

398
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,400
How is Old Gao?

399
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,900
He wants to see Li Xun no matter what. Otherwise, he won't do the surgery.

400
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,100
Please help me persuade him.

401
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,300
He still doesn't want to see me?

402
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,000
Don't think too much. Get the surgery first.

403
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Let's talk about other matters after you recover.

404
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Even if I'm dying, he still doesn't want to see me.

405
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,100
Right?

406
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:05,800


407
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,700
   

408
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,300
 We shouldn't be like this. 

409
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
 Ask him whether he regrets or not. 

410
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,800
 Mom, I do have something to tell you. 

411
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
 I gave birth to you and raised you up. 

412
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,400
 You said I have no right now? 

413
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 I don't agree with you. 

414
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,800
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

415
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,000
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

416
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,800

418

421
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,500
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

422
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
