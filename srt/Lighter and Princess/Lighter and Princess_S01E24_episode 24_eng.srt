1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,200


2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,740
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,300
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,600
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,200
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,400
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,400
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,600
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,100
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,000
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,980
   

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
   

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,300
How is it?

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,100
Gao Jianhong cheated Li Xun and took away L&amp;P.

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Aren't they good friends?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Friendship is ultimately unreliable.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,800
Brother Xiuzhu, can you do me a favor?

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Go ahead.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Although we agreed not to change the plan whatever happens after we get back…

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Get to the point.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,200
But you may have to drive back to Linyang alone.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,000
Then?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,900
Then you might have to have dinner with my parents alone.

33
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,300
Okay.

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
When I have dinner with them,

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
I can tell them about our experience in the past two days

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and tell them how you met Li Xun unexpectedly.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
Then I'll talk about the thing of L&amp;P.

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,500
Finally, I'll tell them the key you lost and finally got back.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,300
Just buy me some time.

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,100
I'll be back after I deal with my matter.

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,400
What else to deal with?

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
You're going to see him?

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,100
We have broken up.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,700
That he left the key is everything he wants to tell me.

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,200
He wanted to leave our love where we should forget.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
What's left between you?

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,900
This company was our dream.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,200
I can't leave L&amp;P alone.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,400
I have to see Li Xun again.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Elegantly speaking, this is self-deception.

51
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,000
Vulgarly speaking,

52
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,500
you ask for torture.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,300
People always think of some high-sounding reasons to jump into the abyss of suffering.

54
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,400
You'd better scold me directly.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,500
I should scold myself if so.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,700
I have said that my prediction is accurate.

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,100
Then you are promising me?

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,800
No.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,900
Think about it.

60
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,000
If I go to have dinner with your parents, they will kill me.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,300
If my mom learns about it, she would stand at my room door tomorrow morning.

62
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,100
Then you should think about it.

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Tomorrow morning?

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,800
She will call you soon after.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
What can we do?

66
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,800
What can we do?

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,700
Then I'll tell her.

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,300
I can tell her a friend came to me.

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,200
He returned from abroad.

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,600
And I will take you with me to meet him.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
It could take two days.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
Great.

73
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,700
You forced me to lie. Great?

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,800
Then you call her.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,200
- You. You. 
 - You.

76
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,890
   

77
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,100
Come on. This is the Internet Conference.

78
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
It's not a fan club.

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,100
Can you lower your voice?

80
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,000
You also know how crazy fans are now.

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,400
That bastard will really come?

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
The Internet Conference is the most important industry event.

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,900
Companies with names will come.

84
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,800
And L&amp;P is the host.

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,100
Gao Jianhong and Fang Zhijing will definitely come.

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,600
As long as the two of them come, Li Xun will not miss it.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go in.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Come on.

89
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,200
Come in.

90
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,700
Back up.

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,900
Above is the contact address.

92
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,000
We are recruiting programmers. Please have a look.

93
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,700
Hello.

94
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,400
Here's my card. Take a look.

95
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
Let me introduce myself.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
I'm a promotion specialist from Zhaoyang Network Operation Company.

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,800
My name is Hong Xiaowei.

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Sorry, I don't have a business card.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
Never mind. What do you do?

100
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm a programmer.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,100
Programmer? That's just right.

102
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,200
Take a look.

103
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
This is our product.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,700
The function is to help current college students contact part-time jobs.

105
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,200
Xiaojian Part-Time?

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,600
Miss, since you are a programmer,

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,400
can you check if we can improve our software?

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,300
I think the current function can be improved a bit.

109
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,500
Now there is only a simple job description and contact information.

110
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,100
Work value evaluation can be added later.

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,000
And now users can only search for work by themselves.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,100
I think it can make an intelligent recommendation based on their strengths.

113
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,000
But do you record the user's search history in the background?

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
- No. 
 - That would be a waste.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,400
Real data is the most valuable resource.

116
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,200
You need to understand the needs of each user.

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
Gradually improve it.

119
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,000
This software has a good starting point and a large market demand.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,300
You are great. I can't see this at all.

121
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,800
Sister, what about you? Do you have any suggestions?

122
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
Me?

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,000
My suggestion is to change the name because Xiaojian Part-Time doesn't sound very lucky.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,900
It might be lucky if its name were changed.

125
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,900
It makes sense.

126
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
Do it step by step.

127
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,800
After it has many registered users in the future, advertisers will come to you.

128
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,900
I will go for it.

129
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,400
You are so awesome.

130
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,900
I envy you.

131
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,700
As for Xiaojian Part-Time, who is Xiaojian?

132
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,400
Wait a moment.

133
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,500
Guo Shijie. Come on! Come on!

134
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,200
Come here.

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,100
This is my boyfriend.

136
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,000
We two just graduated from college this year.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,100
He works several jobs alone.

138
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
- Xiaojian Part-Time is our joint venture project. 
 - Yes, exactly.

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,900
But his main job is in Flying Network Company…

140
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,800
- My Heart Flying Network Company. 
 - My Heart Flying Network Company.

141
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
He's the art director.

142
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
But people usually like to call him Xiaojian.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,300
- Hello. Hello. 
 - Hello. Hello.

144
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,500
She is a programmer. She's amazing.

145
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
You are a programmer?

146
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
It's just right. Our company is recruiting programmers.

147
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
You can have a look. Here is my business card.

148
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,600
The art director of your company even takes charge of recruitment?

149
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,900
There are only four people in our company, including the boss.

150
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,400
It's just started.

151
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,600
Miss, have we met somewhere before?

152
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry. We'll leave as we have activities.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,100
- Are you leaving? 
 - That's fine.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,900
If you are interested in our company,

155
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,200
- keep in touch with me. 
 - Remember to contact us.

156
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
So good to be young.

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,900
Agreed.

158
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,400
Standing at the right air outlet, anybody can succeed.

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,600
- Hello, which company are you from? 
 - L&amp;P.

160
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Check in here.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay.

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,500
Give it to me.

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
All right, guests and friends.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Welcome to the 14th Annual Internet Conference.

165
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,800
At this moment, we have invited our model worker into the online celebrity world,

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,400
Miss Luna and Mr. Gao Jianhong.

167
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Welcome.

168
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,600
Next is our link for taking photos.

169
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Please look at the photographer ahead.

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
Now we leave the time to you

171
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Luna. Luna. Look here.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
This is Gao Jianhong's wife?

173
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,940
Can you take off your sunglasses so that we take some more pictures?

174
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Xu Lina?

175
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,500
She is Xu Lina?

176
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Didn't Xu Lina always chase after Li Xun?

177
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
Why did she marry Gao Jianhong?

178
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,900
Our venue is ready.

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,000
Please come to our meeting place to take a break.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,500
Thank you both. Thank you.

181
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,200
All right. Friends.

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
L&amp;P, lucky and power.

183
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,400
At this moment, we are also looking forward to the activity site of this Internet Conference.

184
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,330
 Your seats are here. Please follow me. 

185
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,900
 This one. 

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
 Let's go there. 

187
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,100
 I saw Mr. Li. 

188
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,200
 Hello, Mr. Zhang. 

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,600
 Long time no see, Zhang. 

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,300
 Long time no see. 

191
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
 Mr. Gao, your position is here. 

192
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,800
 - Mr. Gao. 
 - Hi, Mr. Gao. 

193
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,300
 - Long time no see.  
 - Hello.

194
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,200
Long time no see.

195
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,600
Okay, everybody.

196
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Next, let's welcome the Vice President of L&amp;P Company

197
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Mr. Fang Zhijing to make a speech on the stage.

198
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,470
Let's welcome him with applause.

199
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,700
   
   

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,700
Hello, everyone.

201
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm the Chief Technology Officer of L&amp;P, Fang Zhijing.

202
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,000
 For Chinese games, this year, 

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
 is a year of rethinking about the return of value. 

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
 Why do I say that? 

205
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,600
 Then we should go back to the earliest pioneer era. 

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,700
 All we pursued was data and running water. 

207
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,700
 Now the industry is focusing on the social value of the industry, 

208
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,900
 to explore how companies and industries have a more long-term development. 

209
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,206
With our life getting closer and closer with games,

210
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:57,990
games are not limited to the pure category of entertainment and creative culture.

211
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:02,481
- Sir. 
 - It is also a new educational tool.

212
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,350
Excuse me, sir. Would you please cooperate with us?

213
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,364
In 2018.

214
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:11,110
Sir, please cooperate with us. You can't sit here.

215
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,781
It enables many users to master programming knowledge.

216
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,290
Sir, please leave.

217
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,536
I know him.

218
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:20,440
Okay.

219
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,744
In an environment of education and entertainment, it has a mindset.

220
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,790
I remember the chief cultural officer of Sony.

221
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,870
Have you considered it?

222
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,160
How much?

223
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,360
Say a number.

224
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
All.

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,820
What?

226
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,120
What I want is everything you have.

227
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,280
What do you want me to give you?

228
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,790
Not "give" but "return."

229
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,706
You have another chance.

230
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,640
Let me ask you one last time.

231
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,400
Are you convinced?

232
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,290
Li Xun, are you crazy?

233
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,374
If you say you regret it now,

234
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,006
I'll consider letting you go.

235
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,910
It's the same answer no matter how many times you ask.

236
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,962
If a person does not control himself to such an extent, it's a bit ridiculous.

237
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,360
 Then how can we use the carrier of games 

238
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,528
You don't deserve

239
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,196
the name L&amp;P.

240
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,116
From today on,

241
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,182
I will take L&amp;P back.

242
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,440
You came to tell me this?

243
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,380
Li Xun, I've been long waiting for this day.

244
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
I'm glad this contest is taking place after graduation.

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,272
In this case, we can avoid petty fights.

246
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:13,034
I'd like to see how you take back the name of L&amp;P.

247
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,484
So I believe Chinese games are promising.

248
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,960
I'm from My Heart Flying Network Company.

249
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,180
We are recruiting programmers. Would you like to take a look?

250
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,030
So you found a new company so soon?

251
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,120
Yeah.

252
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,476
Your resume is half done.

253
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,320
It's good if people don't dislike you.

254
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,680
You have no right to dislike others.

255
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,778
I'll contact you.

256
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:13,560
All right, you can call me at any time.

257
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,310
Here's a business card. Have a look.

258
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,430
If necessary, just call me.

259
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,420
Bye.

260
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,810
Hello!

261
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,790
You're still the same as before.

262
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,230
In one way, out the other.

263
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,310
You are also the same as before.

264
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,870
Never looking ahead.

265
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,020
By the way, Zhu Yun came to see me.

266
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,450
Didn't expect it?

267
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,450
Neither did I expect for her to be the same as before.

268
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,416
Even against the world, she will still stand beside you.

269
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,386
This is between us.

270
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:58,510
You stay away from her.

271
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,410
You used to say this and that.

272
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,270
Today, for the sake that we used to be classmates, let me also advise you.

273
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,140
People should be aware of current affairs.

274
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,620
With your identity, it will be hard to find a job.

275
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,940
Do you want me to help you?

276
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,450
It's not the same now.

277
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,526
You can't climb a mountain alone.

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
Gao Jianhong.

279
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,414
Remember this sentence.

280
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,830
I never needed to climb mountains.

281
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,850
Where I am is at the top of the mountain.

282
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,750
Let's go.

283
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,450
   

284
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,300
Is that company on Li Xun's business card the one we just met?

285
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,700
My Heart Flying?

286
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,118
The tire is flat?

287
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,566
On the way, I got a call from your mom.

288
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,350
My mom?

289
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,480
What did she say?

290
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,139
She asked when we would return and if we had met our friend.

291
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:18,848
I said yes.

292
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:23,760
As a result, at this time, the car gave an alarm.

293
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,580
I got out and had a look.

294
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,520
The tire is flat.

295
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,458
But why is your tire one size smaller?

296
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,834
The spare tire.

297
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,820
What did you say?

298
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,930
I said we had met him. We'll be back in two days.

299
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,684
I'm not going back yet.

300
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,970
I wrote a resignation email to the company.

301
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,266
I won't go abroad.

302
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
Okay.

303
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,490
A friend of mine has always invited me to hold an exhibition here.

304
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,310
You can stay in in the name of helping me to hold the painting exhibition.

305
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,170
If we organize more international exchange activities,

306
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,920
it'll be helpful for you to get a green card.

307
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,772
And aunt won't doubt.

308
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,420
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,662
For what?

310
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,270
It's not fair to you.

311
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,938
You shouldn't waste your time on hopeless things.

312
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,036
Why are you so honest?

313
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,930
All right, all right.

314
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,850
Don't make things so complicated.

315
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:45,749
Even if I choose to stay, I have a lot of work to do.

316
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,959
I just think that, staying with you is comfortable and simple.

317
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,660
That is it.

318
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,716
Come and taste this latte.

319
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,240
My Heart Flying Network Company?

320
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,080
It also develops games.

321
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,770
Yeah. But most of its games were cut off before they were launched online.

322
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,100
Long-term recruitment of programmers.

323
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,580
The monthly salary is only 6,500 yuan.

324
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,020
That's too little.

325
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,350
But if it's like the guy said yesterday, even the art director came out to recruit,

326
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,510
6,500 is a big sum for them.

327
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,414
It looks like they are going bankrupt.

328
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:44,410
But Li Xun chose this company.

329
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,786
Are you kidding?

330
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:49,210
It's small, shabby, and unreliable.

331
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,890
Don't talk about dealing with L&amp;P, if Li Xun really goes here, he can't even feed himself.

332
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,100
But does he have any other choice?

333
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,170
L&amp;P is now the industry leader.

334
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,740
Even if any big company wants him,

335
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,648
as long as Gao Jianhong warns them, they won't hire him.

336
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,790
Zhu Yun.

337
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,054
Zhu Yun, have you really thought about it clearly?  To Flying?

338
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:12,750
Now that it's all over,

339
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,740
who will he fight against in the future? It's life or death. What does it have to do with you?

340
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,860
I staying not only for him,

341
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,830
but because we cannot escape the battle with L&amp;P Company.

342
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,906
I must warn you.

343
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,490
There is bound to be a scuffle.

344
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,550
When he raises his flag, you shouldn't jump into the pit.

345
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,590
Are you really going to get involved?

346
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,880
You really don't want to go back?

347
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,520
You don't want your job?

348
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,374
Think about your career.

349
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:41,392
Think about the annual salary

350
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:43,860
of a million US dollars you are going to get.

351
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,440
Now to me and Li Xun, it's not about money and benefits.

352
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,184
It's a dream.

353
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,922
Yes. You have time.

354
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,930
Don't say anything nice.

355
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,860
You are just obsessed with him.

356
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
Bad debt.

357
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,420
   

358
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,000
 - Is there any express delivery for me today? 
 - Look for it. 

359
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,500
 Let me see. Two of them are yours. 

360
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,600
Hello! Where is the My Heart Flying Network Company?

361
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
- Right there. Go from here. 
 - There?

362
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,900
- Take the elevator to the third floor. 
 -  Okay. Thank you.

363
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,800
- Okay. Thank you.
 - Not at all.

364
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,000
 Aren't there two? 

365
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,000
 Sure enough. 

366
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Hello, Director Guo. I'm downstairs.

367
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
I didn't delay the interview?

368
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,600
Okay, I'll be right up.

369
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,600
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

370
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,900
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

371
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,300
♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

372
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,100
♫  Have you ever changed?  ♫

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,300
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

374
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,700
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

375
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,200
♫  It's been so long ago  ♫

376
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
Stop!

377
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,290
You have to let us off first before you get on, don't you know?

378
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,600
Excuse me.

379
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
 What is this? 

380
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,300
 Sorry. Sorry. 

381
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,600
 - Put these two boxes in the back. 
 - Okay. 

382
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,700
 Excuse me. Make way. 

383
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,100
 Thank you. 

384
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,700
 Come here. Make way. 

385
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,400
 What's going on? 

386
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
Sorry.

387
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,900
 Be careful. Be careful. 

388
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,800
   

389
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,800
- Have a drink of water first. 
 - Thank you.

390
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Our director is interviewing inside.

391
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,000
You're the next one.

392
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,300
Let me introduce you.

393
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,900
His name is Zhao Teng.

394
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
We all call him Teng.

395
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,800
He is the flight attendant of our company.

396
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,400
No, he is a programmer in our company, Flight Attendant.

397
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,600
 What? 

398
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
 You've been in prison? 

399
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,400
He always becomes surprised.

400
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,100
Guo Shijie.

401
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,700
Who do you lead to the company every day?

402
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,300
There's someone else. What do you mean?

403
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,200
She came for the interview?

404
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
Yes.

405
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,600
Come in together. I can finish it earlier.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,700
Go for it.

407
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,100
You come in, too.

408
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,500
Come in.

409
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,300
He was in prison.

410
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,300
What have you done?

411
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,900
What are you looking at me for?

412
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,200
What about you? Give me your resume.

413
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,300
Or are you like him?

414
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,400
You have no decent resume at all?

415
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,900
I'm sorry. Here is my resume.

416
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,200
Now young people are incomparable with us at that time.

417
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,100
No qualifications.

418
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,000
Look here.

419
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,600
Good luck.

420
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,900
Guo Xiaojian! Who do you recruit for the company every day?

421
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,700
Either a bastard or a liar.

422
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Liar?

423
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,000
Please make it clear.

424
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Please, be more serious about fraud.

425
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,100
With this qualification, you wouldn't come to my company.

426
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Do you have no confidence in your company?

427
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,500
I-I… Can we talk about things as they are?

428
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,600
Let's just talk about it. You don't think highly of your company at all.

429
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,500
If you always show that the company will go bankrupt tomorrow even when you interview someone,

430
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,600
how can you recruit talent?

431
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,800
You're right. He is always like this.

432
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,700
Even if the company really has no strength, you should also have confidence.

433
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,700
Only with confidence can we have good fortune and touch good cards and turn over.

434
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,800
- In addition, you are the HR Director of the company? 
 - Yes.

435
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,200
Let me make a digression.

436
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
What do you think is the most important for human resources?

437
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,700
What-What do you think?

438
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,600
It is to know people and their abilities.

439
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Otherwise, if you can't recognize the trump card, that's too bad.

440
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,900
Yes.

441
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,500
Trump?

442
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,100
God, she nearly confused me.

443
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,000
You mean you two are trumps?

444
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Is that so? Who is better?

445
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,700
You are the interviewer. It must be up to you to judge.

446
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,000
But even a great talent needs to be discovered, right?

447
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,400
You two...

448
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
are acquaintances?

449
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,300
- Kind of. 
 - No.

450
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,000
Come on. Can you reach an agreement first before you came here?

451
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
How many companies interviewed you before?

452
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,500
I didn't take any interviews when I was abroad.

453
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,600
They hired me directly. This is the first company after coming back.

454
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,900
- What about you? 
 - I haven't had one before I got out of jail.

455
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,600
It's the first time since I was released.

456
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,690
You have a master's degree in Computer Science from Cornell University?

457
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,500
You once won the title of Oracle Excellent Intern.

458
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,600
You were also promoted to Google what?

459
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Google Code Jam.

460
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,200
Global Finals.

461
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Is it true?

462
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,100
Of course, it's true.

463
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,600
Trump.

464
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,500
Great.

465
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,000
Friendly tips, Director Zhang.

466
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,900
President Dong will be back the day after tomorrow.

467
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,200
If you can't recruit any more people,

468
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,900
you can only prepare to break your arm to please him.

469
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,400
You…

470
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,000
No.

471
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
Say something. Comment on it.

472
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,900
In this company, I work and I get scolded.

473
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,100
They don't do anything but play games and eat.

474
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,800
Is it easy for me?

475
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,200
That's not easy for you.

476
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,200
The company belongs to everyone.

477
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,800
But someone must take the lead.

478
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,100
The more scolding you take on just proves that you put in more work.

479
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,700
Those who don't work are, of course, right.

480
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,600
They don't even have a chance to get scolded.

481
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,100
Yeah.

482
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,500
He speaks very well.

483
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,400
- Your name is… 
 - Li Xun.

484
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Yes, Li Xun. Great guy.

485
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah. How easy it is to talk.

486
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
What confidence, what luck?

487
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,300
There is no need to be responsible for opening and closing the mouth..

488
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,600
- Right? 
 - Yeah.

489
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
Look. What is consciousness?

490
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,800
What is style?

491
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,400
That's it.

492
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,800
I think today I know you better.

493
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,200
I'll contact you later.

494
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
See you.

495
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,800
Wait.

496
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
I'll be right down.

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Brother Teng, my girlfriend came to bring me food again.

498
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,100
Bye-bye.

499
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
Only you have a girlfriend?

500
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,800
I'm so angry. I can't see this.

501
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,000
What are you doing?

502
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,200
We're attacking the city.

503
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,500
What's up?

504
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,800
Can you do something serious?

505
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,356
It's easy. Two questions.

506
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:37,860
For the first question, just answer it orally.

507
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,360
Then the second one. You have to do this program question.

508
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,350
"What should I do if the game feels bad?"

509
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,880
What does this "feel" mean?

510
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,910
Look. I said your resume is fake.

511
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,324
You play first.

512
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,800
How is it?

513
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,750
It's boring.

514
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,982
This game was personally planned and created by Director Zhang.

515
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:26,154
But apart from boredom, do you have any other feelings?

516
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:29,020
A little bit stuck, and not very smooth.

517
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,140
And the logical sequence is particularly bad, right?

518
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,664
That's all about feel.

519
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:39,390
Then I simply understand it as optimization and improvement.

520
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,590
Go on.

521
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,780
The data structure and optimization algorithm have problems.

522
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,590
The resource loading is not dynamic,

523
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,620
and memory that is no longer used is not released in time.

524
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,020
And look, this character's response to the player's instructions is not reasonable.

525
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,410
And the data numbers transmitted by this network should also be redundant.

526
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,598
If you adjust all these, the feel should be greatly improved.

527
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,872
Answer this programming question.

528
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,910
Can I ask a question before writing?

529
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,180
It's an exam.

530
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,670
No chatting during the exam. First, answer the question.

531
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,670
It's the same whether I answer it or not.

532
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,378
Do you know?

533
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,109
Do you have any idea about this salary?

534
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,100
It's up to you. But I have one condition.

535
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,300
What condition?

536
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,990
The person taking the interview with me just now should also be employed.

537
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,140
- Your relative? 
 - No.

538
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,172
In this case, who is he to you?

539
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,351
You know what? Our company forbids office romance.

540
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,780
You really think too much.

541
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,430
We do know each other, but I'm unfamiliar with him now.

542
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,500
Unfamiliar? Why do you help him then?

543
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,090
What do you think of our company?

544
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,770
You can't get him here because you know him.

545
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,960
You know, in our company, you have to depend on your ability.

546
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,780
If it's really that hard, forget it.

547
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,760
I hope you find the right employee soon.

548
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,420
Wait.

549
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,670
Come on. Come on. I just have this one decent outfit.

550
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,140
- Sign quickly. 
 - Sign who?

551
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,790
Them.

552
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,132
You didn't hear her engaging into nepotism?

553
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:24,480
It doesn't matter. Think about it.

554
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,750
We pay them 6,500 yuan a person and just 13,000 in total each month.

555
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,401
- Just? 
 - It's of great advantage for us.

556
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:33,480
You know nothing.

557
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,090
In addition, look at that guy.

558
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,710
He can't even present a resume.

559
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,860
And he has been in prison for assault.

560
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,920
You.

561
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,150
He was in prison, and he may have an antisocial personality.

562
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,130
Are you recruiting him without causing trouble for yourself?

563
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,750
Those who have eaten prison food, aren't there a lot of people who come out and reform themselves?

564
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,960
By the way, Director Dong was also in prison.

565
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,140
So, you don't know how scary it is?

566
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,550
It's not enough to have one? What do you mean by hiring another one?

567
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,960
Double overlap gain?

568
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,130
Anyway, I gave my opinion.

569
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,050
But recruitment is your business.

570
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,280
It's up to you. I'll go back to work.

571
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,580
Old Teng, come here.

572
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,150
Tell me the truth.

573
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,870
Is she really that good?

574
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,590
No, dude.

575
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,970
Even you can get paid.

576
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,162
Is she worse than you?

577
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,980
As for your connection,

578
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,090
his situation is quite special.

579
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,670
After all, he was once in prison.

580
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,860
And despite his ability,

581
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,220
he hasn't contacted this industry for several years after all.

582
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,930
No one knows his ability now.

583
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,910
Of course. Our company also has a certain sense of social responsibility.

584
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,050
We are still willing to accept these special persons

585
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,730
and help them to live in society again.

586
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,940
But I also have one condition.

587
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,702
Now that you insist on recruiting him, you need to pay his salary.

588
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,524
Okay, I'll pay him.

589
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,450
You agree?

590
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,630
You are fast. You are fast.

591
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,350
Then I'll tell you about our future arrangement.

592
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,450
Since you two are together, your salary is 6,500 yuan a month.

593
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,400
But here is a tip.

594
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,700
If you are late or leave early, I will deduct your payment.

595
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,700
Of course, if he is late or leaves early, I'll also deduct your payment.

596
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,860
If you accept this condition, you can come to work tomorrow.

597
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,192
I won't let you down.

598
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,590
Okay. Well, congratulations.

599
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,880
Then we will be colleagues from now on.

600
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,680
Don't be polite.

601
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,310
Zhao Teng.

602
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,230
Zhu Yun.

603
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,400
Then I'm leaving.

604
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,680
Okay. See you tomorrow.

605
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,840
Zhang Fang.

606
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,468
Fang.

607
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,026
Great.

608
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,954
You are more and more shameless now.

609
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:05,050
That's a businessman's thinking.

610
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,598
That's acrobatic skill.

611
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,426
Miss Zhu.

612
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,550
What a coincidence. I haven't seen you for a long time.

613
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,250
Coincidence?

614
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,596
You don't seem to be here.

615
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:39,960
I went to the Internet Conference the other day.

616
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,810
This company is good. It has great potential.

617
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,230
Where is the potential?

618
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,530
That's what I want to ask you.

619
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,590
What do you like about it?

620
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Here's a suggestion.

621
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,904
Stay away from me.

622
00:38:54,904 --> 00:38:56,710
You don't have to resist me so much.

623
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,670
It's not bad if we have the same goals in one company.

624
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,070
We can deal with L&amp;P together.

625
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,404
I fight against L&amp;P because it's my stuff.

626
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:12,500
What reason can you have?

627
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,888
Because of our past friendship?

628
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,984
L&amp;P used to be mine.

629
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:22,146
I want to get it back as much as you do.

630
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,366
No matter what our relationship is,

631
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,848
I always believed you were a true genius.

632
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,130
That's why I came.

633
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,720
You don't understand, do you?

634
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,580
Whether I was cheated or cheat or starved to death on the street, it has nothing to do with you.

635
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,266
You just hide as far as you can with your little boy and your awesome résumé.

636
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:52,930
Understand?

637
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,230
I went to meet Gao Jianhong.

638
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,270
I also checked the shareholding structure of L&amp;P.

639
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,160
I won't leave this time whatever you say.

640
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,950
See you tomorrow.

641
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,900
Hello. Dong's special car will serve you.

642
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,660
Please get in the car.

643
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,540
Sir. Sir.

644
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,880
Your car is great.

645
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,710
Why are you willing to use such a good car to do work?

646
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,370
Is it a good car?

647
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,430
I just had a long trip. I haven't washed it for several days.

648
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,820
Don't mind.

649
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,716
This is very clean.

650
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:35,300
We must be serious in providing service.

651
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,568
You are an amateur driver?

652
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:40,330
Full-time. Dong's special car will serve you.

653
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,900
Full-time?

654
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,326
Your car can make money?

655
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:49,550
Sometimes, it's not important to make money or not.

656
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,550
The key is to be happy.

657
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,900
I like driving.

658
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,360
As long as I can drive and carry passengers, I'll be happy.

659
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,200
Please drive faster. I'm in a hurry today.

660
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,490
No problem.

661
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,500
It's not even the traffic jam point yet. Soon.

662
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,734
It's my first day at work today.

663
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,340
First day at work?

664
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,148
Congratulations. Go to a big company and meet a good boss.

665
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,010
See you.

666
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,860
Please give me a five-star review.

667
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,460
Thank you.

668
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:40,230


669
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,720
   

670
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,930
 Li Xun really went to that Flying Network? 

671
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,610
 Not only Li Xun, Zhu Yun also went there. 

672
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,490
 Their company has zero performance now. It won't last long. 

673
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,780
 Li Xun, do you still like me? 

674
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,930
 When can you stop being narcissistic? 

675
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:59,754
 What's your relationship with our Team Leader Zhu? 

676
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,330
 If you don't answer my call again, I will deduct your attendance. 

677
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,842
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

678
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:12,930
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

679
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:20,510
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

684
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,270
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

685
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,410
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

686
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:57,962
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

695
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:58,330

696
