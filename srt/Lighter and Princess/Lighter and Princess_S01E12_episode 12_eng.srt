1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:15,990


2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,500
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,300
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,700
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,400
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,400
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,600
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,100
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,700
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,300
   

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,800
   

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Cut to the chase.

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
You don't have to worry.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Jiang Xingchi is…

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Simple-minded with well-developed limbs.

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,100
Don't worry.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
I have so many things to do.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,800
I have no time for him.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,800
I shouldn't have chosen the volleyball course for you.

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I didn't come to class to beat him.

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,800
You didn't sign me up for this class because of the choppy network, right?

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
I know.

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
You want me to move.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Your back is quite stiff like a rusty door.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,700
You write codes at the base every day.

36
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,000
I just want to find a chance to let you move more.

37
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,500
I accept your kindness.

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,700
♫  Slowly missing you during the long night  ♫

39
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,200
♫  A moment of a fast beating heart  ♫

40
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
♫  As long as you're by my side  ♫

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
♫  I forgot time unconsciously  ♫

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,800
♫  Slowly understanding you on the long road  ♫

43
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,400
♫  Without you, even joy feels lonely  ♫

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,700
♫  Looking at your white shirt  ♫

45
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,300
♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

46
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,700
♫  The secret I've been hiding  ♫

47
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,100
♫  I really want to be with you  ♫

48
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,600
♫  The knight and princess are destined to meet  ♫

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,370
♫  Let me feel and guard your simple wish  ♫

51
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,500
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,600
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,900
♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

54
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,700
♫  You say every good night  ♫

55
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,400
♫  Happiness has never changed  ♫

56
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,600
Attention, everyone.

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
We'll finish our course today.

58
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,500
I'll test your ability of catching balls.

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,600
There are twenty balls for each person.

60
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
If you catch eight balls, you will pass the exam.

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Twelve is excellent.

62
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Sixteen is full marks.

63
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
- Any questions? 
  - No. No. 

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
All right, let's start the exam right away.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,800
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

66
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
I'll help you later.

67
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,900
Thank you.

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,700
Zhu Yun.

69
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,000
Here.

70
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,100
 One. 

71
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,170
 Two. 

72
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,160
 Three. 

73
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
 Four. 

74
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,200
 Five. 

75
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
 Thirteen. 

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
 Fifteen. 

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,300
 Seventeen. 

78
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,800
 Eighteen. 

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Jiang Xingchi, don't go too far.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
I can't give her two hundred points.

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,500
Coach.

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,100
Thank you, coach.

83
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,700
Next one.

84
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Happy now?

85
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,200
It's not bad. He's a little better than you.

86
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,100
Nothing more.

87
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Next. Li Xun.

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Come on.

89
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,920
 One. 

90
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,310
 Two. 

91
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,490
 Three. 

92
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,880
 Four. 

93
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,290
 Eight. 

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Are you going to go on?

95
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
No need.

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
The number eight is lucky.

97
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
You are great.

98
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,100
I was thinking if you failed, you would lose face.

99
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,000
What's wrong?

100
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,700
Li Xun.

101
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
Are you okay?

102
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Li Xun, are you okay?

103
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,450
Li Xun.

104
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,440
   

105
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,500
This is his old sickness.

106
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,600
He didn't deal with it in stages I and II.

107
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,300
So now it's getting worse and worse.

108
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,000
If he doesn't get treatment, he won't even be able to walk.

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Well, tomorrow morning at 9:00, you can go and find Director Wang.

110
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,100
Show him this film to see if he needs surgery.

111
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,700
It's so serious?

112
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,500
If the surgery is scheduled now, it may be half a year later.

113
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,900
He can take physical therapy while waiting.

114
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,800
If it's effective, he won't need to have surgery.

115
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,400
Okay. Then I'll handle this first.

116
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

117
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,900
Doctor, do you know where my brother is?

118
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,500
- What's your brother's name? 
 - Li Xun.

119
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,400
Li Xun?

120
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,700
Don't you know her?

121
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,900
Who is his family member?

122
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm his classmate.

123
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,500
Who are you?

124
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,800
I'm his elder sister.

125
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,100
Well, sister, Li Xun is still in the emergency observation room.

126
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,300
- I can lead you there. 
 - Okay, thanks.

127
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,780
- Thank you, doctor. 
 - Never mind.

128
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,400
This way.

129
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,300
 Li Xun has an elder sister? 

130
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,530
 I've never heard of this from him. 

131
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Don't worry. He is fine now.

132
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,200
Thank you.

133
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,980
I live in the suburbs.

134
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,240
I came as soon as I got the call from the school teacher.

135
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,820
It's a long way.

136
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,740
Fortunately, you took care of him.

137
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,810
Never mind.

138
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,520
He fainted after PE class. I was right there.

139
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,790
Don't worry.

140
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,690
The doctor just gave him a painkiller.

141
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,390
He'll wake up later.

142
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,450
Have you eaten yet?

143
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,080
Why don't we go downstairs and buy some food?

144
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,730
Okay.

145
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,020
Thank you.

146
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,760
There is some more.

147
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,080
Student, it should be my treat.

148
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,030
-  Let me pay it. 
 - No need. I can pay it.

149
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,960
It's my treat.

150
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,900
I don't know what you like.

151
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,940
Are you coming here from Linyang?

152
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,900
I married there.

153
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,810
Our family was poor.

154
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,510
My mother was sick.

155
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,420
I just wanted to work,

156
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,020
but I didn't make any money.

157
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,510
My brother... wanted to earn money to support the family early.

158
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,210
His back suffered from this before.

159
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,580
The doctor said Li Xun's spine was injured.

160
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,910
What's going on?

161
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,900
Blame me.

162
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,800
It's my fault.

163
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,290
He's so young.

164
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,120
What should he do in the future?

165
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,780
Don't worry, sister.

166
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,770
We'll force him to get surgery this time.

167
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,530
It's useless.

168
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,690
He won't listen to us.

169
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,600
He never listens to us.

170
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
He's lying in the hospital.

171
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,690
He is like the meat on the chopping board. How can he have a say?

172
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,750
You are his family and you have the right to sign.

173
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,040
It really works?

174
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,280
Give him an anesthetic injection at worst and then push him to the operating room.

175
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,300
He won't decline it.

176
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,590
The doctor asked me to take his CT film to the Orthopedics Department tomorrow.

177
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,080
How about I come to you tomorrow morning? Let's go together.

178
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,610
Okay.

179
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,290
Student, what's your name?

180
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,250
My name is Zhu Yun.

181
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,120
Thank you, Zhu Yun.

182
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,990
Thank you very much.

183
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,730
Never mind.

184
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,380
Sister, eat more.

185
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,000
It is estimated that Li Xun will wake up soon. We can still go and see him.

186
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,470
If he wakes up,

187
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,680
I won't go up.

188
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,060
I'll leave later.

189
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,950
Please take care of Li Xun for me.

190
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,710
Thank you.

191
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,400
You've come here but refuse to see him.

192
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Is there some difficulties?

193
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,260
He probably doesn't want to see us.

194
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,610
It's right for him to do this.

195
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,490
Why?

196
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,770
You really want to know what happened to Li Xun before?

197
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,720
When he was in high school, my mom was sick.

198
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,680
To cure my mom, Li Xun began to find ways to earn money.

199
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,370
 You don't believe it? 

200
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,590
 Of course, I don't believe it. My general order is useful. 

201
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,220
 How much is your account? 

202
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,210
 This full-class divine costume costs a hundred thousand yuan. 

203
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,680
 You said it's one hundred thousand. 

204
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,240
 Let's bet one percent of it. 1,000 yuan. 

205
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,080
 Okay. I don't believe it. 

206
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,410
 If you can steal my account in front of me, from now on, you are my dad. 

207
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,050
 I don't have a wastrel son like you. 

208
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,380
 Look here. 

209
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,810
 Is it your account? 

210
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,140
 Awesome. 

211
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,480
 How did you do it? 

212
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,450
 The person who just sold you equipment on QQ was me. 

213
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,210
 It's a hidden plan? 

214
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,610
 Haven't you heard that we shouldn't click the strange website linkage? 

215
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,140
 The website was just a Trojan. 

216
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,350
 As long as you input your information, it will be shown immediately on my side. 

217
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,460
 Be careful in the future. 

218
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,960
 Can you help me? 

219
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,780
 - That equipment… 
 - I can't. 

220
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,400
 I'll pay you. 3,000 or 5,000? 

221
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
 Say a number. 

222
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,330
 Okay, 1,000. Count it. 

223
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,820
 I keep my word. 

224
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,030
 You are so skilled, why not come to help me? 

225
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,440
 You are here. 

226
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,870
 Yeah. 

227
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,240
 How's Mom? 

228
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,550
 Doctor just gave her morphine. 

229
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,220
 She is asleep. 

230
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,270
 She gets morphine once a day before. 

231
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,140
 But now, she gets one every four hours. 

232
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,180
 This money… 

233
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,470
 Don't worry. 

234
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,280
 Labor gains. 

235
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,580
 Don't worry. 

236
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,090
 Can you stop dancing? 

237
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,600
 Li Xun, just let me dance one last dance. 

238
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,000
 I'm afraid I can't dance anymore. 

239
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,760
 You have a terminal disease? 

240
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,880
 I'm sure I can't pass the unified exams. 

241
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,610
 My dad won't let me dance anymore. 

242
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,620
 He is right. 

243
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,380
 You're like a pole. 

244
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,350
 Can you dance well? 

245
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,840
 Don't let me hear music again. 

246
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:49,240
 You know I'm good at Latin dance only. 

247
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,770
 My academic performance is really poor. 

248
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:58,310
 As soon as this exam was over, I checked the answers and found I just didn't pass. 

249
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,010
 My dad said he wouldn't prevent me from dancing unless I pass the exam 

250
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,610
 and get the high school graduation certificate. 

251
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,880
 Otherwise, he would send me to study business in the UK. 

252
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,820
 My favorite Latin dance. 

253
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,720
 Have you finished? 

254
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,990
 I heard our scores are stored in the computer of the Academic Affairs Office. 

255
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,860
 - How about we… 
 - Don't ever think about it. 

256
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,670
 I will never do anything that violates the school rules. 

257
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,020
 Let's have a talk. 

258
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,720
 In ancient times, someone cut his flesh to save his mother. 

259
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,520
 As for you, your mother needs money to stay in the hospital. 

260
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
 As long as I pass the exam, my dad will definitely give me pocket money. 

261
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,040
 Don't mention my mom. 

262
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,400
 Okay, fine. I know. 

263
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,030
 Liu Xiang didn't run fast to be a thief. 

264
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,310
 You don't want to earn this money. 

265
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,000
 Mom. 

266
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,430
 With the sun, 

267
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
 it's so great. 

268
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,900
 Let's go. 

269
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,810
 One course of treatment costs at least 140,000 yuan? What do you want? 

270
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,520
 You want to rob me? 

271
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,140
 Don't say useless things. 

272
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,100
 Listen. I have no money. 

273
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,480
 Sister. 

274
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,040
 Why are you back again? 

275
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,020
 Dr. Zhao said Japan has now developed a new targeted drug 

276
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,780
t o especially treat patients with advanced liver cancer like mom. 

277
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,480
 It's called... 

278
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,150
 it's called something-ni? 

279
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
 Lenvartini. 

280
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,100
 Yeah. This is the medicine. 

281
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,600
 Dr. Zhao said this medicine may help to treat our mother's illness 

282
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,300
 and it can prolong her life span of three months. 

283
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,800
 Never mind. Don't worry. 

284
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 I'll try to get money. 

285
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,500
 We've entered it. 

286
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,600
 Correct the mark yourself. 

287
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,200
 Great. 

288
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,800
 One hundred and forty thousand, 

289
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,100
 four thousand and three hundred. 

290
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,100
 The sooner, the better. 

291
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
 No problem. 

292
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,100
 Once the result is announced, 

293
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,200
 my dad can afford one million yuan at least, let alone 140,000. 

294
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,600
 Is it cool, Mom? 

295
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
 The sun is warm. 

296
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
 It's just right. 

297
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,700
 Li Xun! Li Xun. 

298
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,900
 Why are you here? 

299
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,400
 Auntie looks really good today. 

300
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,700
 Mom, will you stay here? 

301
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,900
 Go back. 

302
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
 Okay. 

303
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
 Come here. 

304
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,700
 - What's up? 
 - The school knows about the mark change. 

305
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,700
 The Education Bureau has also sent a director surnamed Liu to especially investigate this. 

306
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,400
 They will find us out soon. 

307
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,800
 - How much did you change? 
 - 95. 

308
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,900
 95 points for each subject? 

309
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,200
 There are also 90. 

310
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
 Are you mad? 

311
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,500
 You usually get 60 points. 

312
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
 But you changed it to 95! 

313
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,600
 I... I thought if my score was higher, my dad would give me more pocket money. 

314
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,900
 Is she the person from the Education Bureau? 

315
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,300
 Liu Ailin? 

316
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's her. 

317
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,900
 I saw her entering the headmaster's office. 

318
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,400
 Due to serious violation of school rules, 

319
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,790
 Li Xun and Fu Yizhuo from Class2, Grade 3 were expelled from school. 

320
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,400
 Don't worry. I'm going to find Director Liu. 

321
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,100
 I said I did it alone. 

322
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,200
 The Education Bureau is not that blind. 

323
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,500
 Do you know the twenty-one ports of the computer? 

324
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,700
 - What port? 
 - Mom. 

325
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,600
 Mom! 

326
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,040
 Mom! 

327
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,300
 Mom. 

328
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,900
 Mom. 

329
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
 Mom, I'm sorry. 

330
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
 I'm sorry. 

331
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,700
Li Xun was expelled.

332
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,000
But he didn't get the money to cure our mom.

333
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,200
He didn't even see mom for the last time.

334
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
 Please sign here. 

335
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,100
   

336
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,400
 Let me tell you something. 

337
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
 When you pick up the urn later, 

338
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,900
 don't listen to those people fooling around and buy one costing thousands of yuan. 

339
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,400
 Those businessmen are greedy. 

340
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,900
 Just buy one costing a few hundred yuan as long as it's good. 

341
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,000
 Dagang, my mom is gone. 

342
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,400
 Your mom's disease is incurable. It's good that she died earlier. 

343
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,020
 Or hundreds of thousands of yuan will be wasted, leaving… 

344
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,500
 Stop. 

345
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,100
 Dagang, what are you doing? 

346
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,000
 Stop. Zhang Dagang. Stop! 

347
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
 - Li Xun. 
 - Li Xun. 

348
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,200
 Are you okay? 

349
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,400
 Maybe he hurt the spine. 

350
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,200
 Do a computed tomography first to check the situation. 

351
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,300
 He may need surgery at worst. 

352
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,200
 How much is that? 

353
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,000
 Twenty or thirty thousand for surgery. 

354
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,700
 Be careful. Be careful. 

355
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,600
 Go. Let's take the computed tomography. 

356
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
 Let's go. 

357
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
 I won't go. 

358
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,200
 What if your spine is hurt? 

359
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,100
 You gave up mom, 

360
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
 let alone me. 

361
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,600
Li Xun's back was beaten by my husband the day my mother died.

362
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,000
He's been keeping his anger in check

363
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,200
and learned for one more year and retook the college entrance examination.

364
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,500
Then he didn't go home much.

365
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,400
How long have you not seen Li Xun?

366
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,800
It's been quite a long time.

367
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,850
   

368
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,900
When did you come back?

369
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,800
Who allowed you to leave the hospital?

370
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
What's your hurry?

371
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,500
I wrote the switched virtual circuit for you last night.

372
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,900
I saw it.

373
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Nice job.

374
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,700
Li Xun.

375
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,800
You have a bad spine. Why didn't you tell me?

376
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,300
With your physical condition, you can't play volleyball at all.

377
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,000
You can't program while sitting long like this.

378
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,300
Your position is the worst posture for the spine now.

379
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,400
Anyway, it's already like this.

380
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,100
The doctor said it slipped badly. You'd better have surgery.

381
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Nope.

382
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,300
Why not?

383
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,500
I'm busy.

384
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,000
How come? What are you busy with?

385
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
Why are you so nosy?

386
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,500
Does it have anything to do with you?

387
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,700
I checked it yesterday. There's little risk of surgery now.

388
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,800
Even if there is a ten-thousandth chance, I won't have it.

389
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,400
I would rather die than be paralyzed.

390
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,900
I'll take these two back and have a look.

391
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
I'll return them to you later.

392
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,800
Okay.

393
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,430
   

394
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,400
Central Stadium...

395
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,900
Class rep, have you had a meal yet?

396
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Who placed this here?

397
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,600
I don't know.

398
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,500
Hurry up and deliver it.

399
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,300
Don't be late.

400
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,900
He knew that Li Lan went to the hospital yesterday.

401
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,100
These sister and brother.

402
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,310
   

403
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,600
Thank you, Zhu Yun.

404
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,200
It doesn't matter. I like Pu Shu, too.

405
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,500
My brother and I used to listen to Pu Shu's songs together.

406
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:58,770
At that time, he said he would invite me to attend Pu Shu's concert after he earned money.

407
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,090
Thank you for fulfilling our dreams.

408
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,600
It's about to begin. Let's go inside.

409
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,190
- Okay.  
 - Go.

410
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,070
   

411
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,790
 Bag check. 

412
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,460
 Open the bag. Thank you. 

413
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,280
 Okay. You can go. 

414
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,230
 Go in, please. 

415
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:39,340
 Pu Shu. Pu Shu. Pu Shu. 

416
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,240

431
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,600
 Li Xun told me there was only one thing on his mind. 

432
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,640
 He just wanted Mom to see the sun again, 

433
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,980
 even if it's only one more day, one more time.

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,870
 this is our destiny. 

437
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,670
 We have to admit it.

♫  Just so crazy  ♫

439
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,160
 I won't admit it. 

440
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,620
 Have you made up your mind? 

441
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,570
 If this is dyed, it won't be washed off. 

442
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,460
 If you can't get into school, don't blame me. 

443
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,430
 Even if everyone in the world admits the fact, 

444
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,720
 I want to be different from them.

 I won't give in. 

449
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,100
 I can only depend on myself. 

450

That's nice.

456
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,830
Let's wait for a taxi over there.

457
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,840
Go.

458
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,160
Although Li Xun never says it,

459
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,990
I thank you for him.

460
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,600
That's how he is.

461
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,240
He keeps everything in his heart but he always pretends to be indifferent.

462
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,820
Clearly he cares about something, but he pretends not to care about it.

463
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,230
That's true.

464
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,130
But I can see he treats you differently.

465
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,090
He asked you to come with me. He trusts you.

466
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,310
Is that so?

467
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,840
But you should be careful.

468
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,480
Don't be manipulated by him.

469
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,250
I understand him deeply.

470
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:48,410
Sometimes, you have to make him worried.

471
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,510
In a relationship, you can't always pay alone.

472
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,170
Got it.

473
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,250
The taxi comes.

474
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,300
Then I'm leaving.

475
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,400
Bye-bye.

476
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,470
Thank you.

477
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,790
See you next time.

478
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,050
When did you come? Li Lan just left.

479
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,960
I saw it.

480
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,440
Why didn't you see her off? She is right.

481
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,600
You just care, but you pretend that you don't care.

482
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,240
You did it on purpose. You're just afraid of being too sentimental.

483
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,730
So much nonsense.

484
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,310
Li Lan is very happy. She said thank you.

485
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,800
What else?

486
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,670
And…

487
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,300
 You should be careful. 

488
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,120
 Don't be manipulated by him. 

489
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,130
 Am I manipulated by you? 

490
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,100
 Am I so easily manipulated? 

491
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,850
She said to make you worried.

492
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,310
I know.

493
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,720
It may not be good if it is delayed.

494
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,970
But I really don't want to have surgery.

495
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,220
I can't afford to take this risk.

496
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,910
Yeah.

497
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,870
The thought of Li Xun sitting in a wheelchair is strange.

498
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,920
Stop that.

499
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,600
In the future, you have to move every half an hour and take physical therapy every day.

500
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,370
The school hospital can do it.

501
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,140
I'll register you tomorrow.

502
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,780
Whatever.

503
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,200


504
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,880
   

505
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,570
 I finally figured it out. Li Xun listens to you 

506
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,040
♫  And have passed through the dark night  ♫

507
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,230
 Li Xun, I know this is your project. 

508
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,430
 I don't have a say in it. 

509
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,180
 But I don't want to waste my effort, and my time, and energy. 

510
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,910
 - Whatever. 
 - I've decided to quit the base. 

511
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,280
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

512
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,200
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

513
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,160
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

514
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:42,760
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

515
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,480
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

516
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,960
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

517
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,000
♫  We will not separate  ♫

518
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,020
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

519
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,560
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

520
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,600
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

521
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:20,060
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

522
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,340
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

523
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,800
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

524
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,000
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

525
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,680
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

526
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,140
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

527
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,600
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

528
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,080
♫  That hot firework  ♫

529
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:05,380
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

530
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,540
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

531
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,460
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

532
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,460
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

533
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,940
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

534
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,180
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

535
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,660
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

536
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,980
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

537
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,480
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

538
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:56,060
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

539
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,740
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

540
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,060
♫  True love will take its course ♫

541
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,360
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

542
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,900
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

543
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,440
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

544
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,920
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

545
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,300
♫  That hot firework  ♫

546
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:38,160
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

547

♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

548
