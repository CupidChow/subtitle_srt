00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:15,070


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,300
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,460
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,140
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,500
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,750
- I'll have a cup of Americano. 
 - Okay. Just a moment.

23
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,050
- Thank you. 
 - Please visit us again.

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
He's quite handsome.

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
But I wonder if you can handle him.

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,090
He's coming. He's coming.

27
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,500
Li Xun.

28
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,970
I'm Chen Minmin from School of Foreign Languages.

29
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,280
Would you like to dine with me later?

30
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,580
No.

31
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,420
Are you going back to your dorm later?

32
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,990
No.

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,310
If you need anything, just let me know.

34
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,390
No need.

35
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,400
What a poser!

36
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,540
Is it fun?

37
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm not stalking you.

38
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,740
I'm here on a mission.

39
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,270
Really?

40
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,090
Here's the thing.

41
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,410
The department has recently checked the attendance of morning self-study.

42
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,370
Well, we're freshmen and we just started school, so the department keeps a close eye on us.

43
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,910
Are you in primary school or kindergarten?

44
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,790
Do you think it's useful to study in the morning?

45
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,670
No matter whether it's useful or not, that's the rule of the school.

46
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,800
- We should observe... 
 - Here.

47
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,520
Press the space button.

48
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,640
   

49
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
A game?

50
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,760
Move the character around to avoid the ball coming down from above and across the river.

51
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,970
Three chances.

52
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,300
If you make it, I'll attend the morning self-study.

53
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,270
Keep your word.

54
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,300
You called that a ball coming down from above?

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,590
It clearly smashes down.

56
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,570
How many balls are there?

57
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,130
 Two balls for three chances. 

58
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,260
 I already know where the first one is going to land. 

59
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,800
 I'm going to find out where the next one will fall next, and pass it at the third chance. 

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,740
 That's simple. 

61
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,310
This ball is going way too fast.

62
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,560
I've pressed the keyboard as fast as I can.

63
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,470
Are you throwing in the towel?

64
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,700
Isn't there another chance?

65
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,060
 Game over. 

66
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,320
What's going on?

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,970
Editor.

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,600
   

69
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,490
 [// if we have only one player, we restart the level, if (Player.Count &lt; 2) 

70
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,620
- This if statement means… 
 - The player is dead when crossing the river.

71
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,940
If the player gets hit by a ball, he dies.

72
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,600
- If he crosses the river, he dies too. You must have got it wrong. 
 - No.

73
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,700
- I'll die anyway. 
 - Yeah.

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,560
- So this is a game to lose. 
 - Yeah.

75
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,770
Why did you want me to play it?

76
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,040
I don't like you.

77
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,640
What?

78
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,000
Because I don't like you.

79
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,130
Why?

80
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,180
You are so fake.

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,220
You lose. Don't come to me for morning self-study again.

82
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,310
And this is my place.

83
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,900
You are not allowed to come up without my permission.

84
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,060
Why couldn't you just cross the river?

85
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,100
I did.

86
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,040
So what?

87
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,990
He designed that program.

88
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,070
I died anyway.

89
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,640
Didn't he just make fun of you?

90
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,300
In fact, his little game was quite simple.

91
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,140
Although I still don't understand the meaning of that function,

92
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,120
the logic of the code was very simple.

93
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,070
Although I don't know how the rich become rich,

94
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,370
I think the logic is very simple.

95
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,990
Fang Shumiao, for whom did I suffer such humiliation?

96
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,040
Another four points will be deducted tomorrow.

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,670
Four points after four points.

98
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,920
How many four points are left?

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,040
What's the point of reading now? You lost.

100
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,900
He said I was so fake. I think he just has a problem with me.

101
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,200
Is it great to know how to program?

102
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,370
- What's wrong? 
 - Look at this.

103
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,190
Isn't it the same game?

104
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,620
It's said that he was the top scorer.

105
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,190
But he just used an example from the textbook.

106
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,040
Are you still reading? Stop staying up and go to bed.

107
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,810
Did Li Xun irritate you so much?

108
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,320
Yes, he really did.

109
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
You!

110
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,560
- Zhu Yun. 
 - Morning.

111
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,420
You must be possessed.

112
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,060
No. It's lights-out time. Where do you get the electricity?

113
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,450
Beware of electric shock.

114
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,700
I managed to get it from the water room.

115
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,430
Are you waiting for me?

116
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,020
Shall we play a ball game in the afternoon?

117
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,960
How about yesterday?

118
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,920
Sure.

119
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,540
Why are we sitting this far in the front?

120
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,730
People tend to be sleepy when the computer is hot.

121
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,010
I won't doze off in the front.

122
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,910
Looks like you're really in a fight with Li Xun.

123
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,580
It's not a big deal.

124
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,460
We lost another four points this morning.

125
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,380
It is a big deal.

126
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,480
The professor is surnamed Lin.

127
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,870
The seniors said they all call him Old Lin privately,

128
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,740
and he is a big shot in the circle.

129
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,070
 Nine out of ten coders are bald and one is with sparse hair. 

130
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,190
 It's no exaggeration at all. 

131
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,360
 He hasn't come yet. 

132
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,730
 He doesn't even show up for the first class. 

133
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,140
 How can he be that arrogant? 

134
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,640
Well, this computer is broken and can't be started.

135
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,840
- Broken? 
 - Yes.

136
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,140
- You can find another spot. 
 - Here.

137
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,620
So warm-hearted.

138
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,000
 No, no, no. 

139
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,710
What a fatal attraction!

140
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,460
Boys and girls, do any of you

141
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,160
know about C language

142
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,980
or have tried to write some small programs in C language before?

143
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,840
We all know that it's an information society now.

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,240
The computer develops very fast,

145
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,010
and so does the programming language.

146
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,200
Compared with the emerging programming languages,

147
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,760
C language is like me standing in front of you.

148
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,480
What does that mean?

149
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,160
It's getting old.

150
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,580
As the old saying goes, "Older and wiser."

151
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,380
Age has many advantages.

152
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,140
The older it gets,

153
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,430
the richer and more rigorous it is.

154
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,010
No matter whether you go on studying algorithms,

155
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,790
compilations, databases, or operating systems,

156
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,200
the C language skills you're going to learn

157
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,690
will be the foundation for all of your future programming.

158
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,790
Kungfu is all about skill.

159
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,200
Don't make mistakes that good students usually like to make.

160
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,180
   

161
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,270
Be a fight-to-the-death book.

162
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,310
At the mention of C language, the first thing we need to know is what C language is.

163
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,450
So who can tell me what C language is?

164
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,180
Raise your hand!

165
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,540
- You studied so long last night. 
 - The nail that sticks up will be hammered down.

166
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,680
Lend it to me.

167
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Lend it to me. Lend it to me.

168
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,370
What are you two talking about?

169
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,510
Are you reading other books?

170
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,150
Notes.

171
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,380
How detailed these notes are.

172
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,690
Can you answer my question?

173
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,680
C language is a process-oriented abstract programming language,

174
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,030
which is widely used in low-level development.

175
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,930
C language can be compiled in a simple way to deal with low-level memory.

176
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,610
It's a high-level programming language

177
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,690
that produces only a small amount of machine language

178
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,570
and does not require any runtime support to run.

179
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,360
Despite its many low-level features,

180
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,970
it remains cross-platform

181
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,380
and can be compiled on many computer platforms,

182
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,820
including embedded processors and supercomputers.

183
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,370
Good job.

184
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,170
Let's give her a big hand.

185
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,420
Take your seat.

186
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,210
Your game is no big deal.

187
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,310
What a fight-to-the-death book.

188
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,080
- What's your name, classmate? 
 - I'm Zhu Yun.

189
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,690
Zhu Yun.

190
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,460
It's easy to remember and it sounds good.

191
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,650
You'll be my class rep.

192
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,630
I can't, sir.

193
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,550
You can.

194
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,370
Why can't you?

195
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,120
It seems you are not only shy but also modest.

196
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,570
It's a done deal.

197
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,610
You've got to stop being modest.

198
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,500
Let's move on.

199
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,430
 Game over. 

200
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,660
Mr. Lin, as for the class rep, you'd better find someone else.

201
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Why? Are you afraid it will take too much of your time?

202
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,230
Not really.

203
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,700
It's just a bit of a hassle.

204
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,990
What's the difference?

205
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,760
Don't make a decision. Go back and think about it.

206
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,320
We have a class tomorrow.

207
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,360
Can you answer me then?

208
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,650
I have to go to the canteen.

209
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,740
My wife will be mad at me if I fail to buy red-cooked pork.

210
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,460
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

211
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,950
It's good to be a class rep.

212
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,700
You're so lucky.

213
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,370
He is a big shot in the circle and going to give us several specialized courses.

214
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,550
You can't do any harm by cottoning up to him.

215
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,240
Come on, I'll wait for you.

216
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,210
From primary school to junior high school, I have been the class rep

217
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,220
of Chinese, math, English, biology, chemistry, and geography.

218
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,670
If I was serious, my classmates would be annoyed with me.

219
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,040
If I didn't take it seriously, the teacher scolded me.

220
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,500
I was dog-tired every day, but couldn't please either side.

221
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,690
I didn't want to to be a class rep again after I made it to college.

222
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,270
Are you afraid he'll get you in trouble if you're the class rep?

223
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,430
He's part of the reason.

224
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,620
Aren't you the perfect example?

225
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,160
 Some people think the college entrance examination is the end. 

226
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,110
 This is absolutely wrong. 

227
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,560
 College is where you're really taught how to live. 

228
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,680
 So the college entrance examination isn't the destination 

229
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,530
or even an intermediate station.

230
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,430
You can't take it easy in college.

231
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,240
Is it time to choose class leaders?

232
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,890
 Were you in? 

233
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,180
No.

234
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,160
What about the class rep?

235
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,310
 Class reps have the most contact with teachers and are very important. 

236
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,380
There is one.

237
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,450
 Which class? 

238
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,690
C Language. It was settled today.

239
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,270
That's great.

240
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,850
 Then do your best and show your teacher what you can do. 

241
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,140
I didn't say yes.

242
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,640
Why?

243
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,660
Do you dislike the class or the teacher?

244
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,090
 You can't always be so headstrong. 

245
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,110
 It's supposed to be tough and tiring to study or work. 

246
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,890
Mom, I really don't want to be a class rep anymore.

247
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,230
 No way. You have to listen to me. 

248
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,560
 I've worked in education all my life. 

249
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,150
I can tell you responsibly that being a class rep will only do you good and no harm.

250
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,460
- But… 
 - Enough.

251
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,470
When is the next C Language class?

252
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,450
Tomorrow.

253
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,150
Okay. Then tell the teacher in class tomorrow that you want to be the class rep.

254
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,770
You hear me?

255
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,890
- Mom! 
 - Just do as I say.

256
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,450
 I have a meeting soon. 

257
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,120
I have to go. Do as you're told.

258
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
Are you going to do the laundry?

259
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,870
Yes.

260
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,820
That's a very good idea.

261
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,610
You can't be a good programmer without breaking a few keyboards.

262
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,040
Class rep, come here.

263
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,380
Distribute these copies to everyone.

264
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,900
Sir, I haven't decided yet.

265
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,840
Come here.

266
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,730
Is Director Liu your mom?

267
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,100
Yes.

268
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,910
Your mom spoke to me through one of the school leaders about your concerns.

269
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,840
You don't have anything to worry about, do you?

270
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,550
The fact that I asked you to be the class rep means

271
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,920
I have every confidence in your ability, doesn't it?

272
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,020
My mom said I agreed, right?

273
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,730
Yes.

274
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,620
Why? Is there a problem?

275
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,880
No.

276
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Jianhong is organizing a programming interest group.

277
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,140
You should join it, too!

278
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,150
- Why me? 
 - Sure.

279
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,070
All the teachers of my professional class have participated.

280
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,910
How can you, the class rep, not join it?

281
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,970
Mr. Lin has agreed to be the instructor of the interest group,

282
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,690
and even said that he would apply for a place for us to do activities.

283
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,820
Join in.

284
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,880
So not only do you have to join it

285
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,320
but you also have to be in charge together with Jianhong.

286
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,730
Well, I finally got you back.

287
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,510
I tried to make a small program in C language, but it never executes correctly.

288
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,380
Can you help me out? I've been working on it all day.

289
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,240
I declare the pointer first.

290
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,500
Next, all I have to do is allocate space to the graph and then I can manipulate the nodes directly.

291
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,750
- Why? 
 - Because there are nodes in the space of the graph.

292
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,760
I have to allocate memory space to the nodes when I apply for a graph.

293
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,350
Why can't it be executed correctly?

294
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,160
Because I didn't give a graph memory address to the pointer.

295
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,730
Why are you asking me when you know the answer?

296
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,150
Li Xun, Old Lin has agreed to tutor our interest group

297
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,250
and apply for a space for our activities.

298
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm not in.

299
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm in.

300
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,640
So?

301
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,710
So?

302
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,140
I wanted to try out Li Xun's C language level,

303
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,480
but he set me up and I solved the problem by myself.

304
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
I think Li Xun is a master.

305
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,690
He deliberately led you to the answer.

306
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,310
It means he knew the answer.

307
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,690
I also feel that.

308
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,990
Li Xun is writing code in the dorm every day.

309
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,830
I can't read what he wrote anyway.

310
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
I don't think so.

311
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,340
Some people are just bluffing and actually don't understand anything.

312
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,360
How could he be a top scorer?

313
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,970
Someone is blinded by hate.

314
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,440
Someone helps others and can't tell the good from the bad.

315
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,050
Zhu Yun has a point.

316
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,910
Actions speak louder than words.

317
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,750
If you want to know how good Li Xun is, you have to look at what he writes.

318
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,170
Anyway we can make the game he did last time after a few classes.

319
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,770
That's the basic function. It doesn't look good to me.

320
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,330
Indeed.

321
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,320
This is a place Old Lin applied for us.

322
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,970
This is going to be the home of our programming interest group.

323
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,700
This is the place where we can do our activities.

324
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
What do you think? Pretty big.

325
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,300
It's so spacious.

326
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,140
It's a little dirty.

327
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,860
It'll be nice and tidy if we clean it up.

328
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,240
We'll have to do a deep clean.

329
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,700
You can.

330
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,710
Old Gao, why are you so interested in Li Xun's programming skills?

331
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,540
I just want to know how big the gap between us and the top scorer is.

332
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,580
You're not convinced, huh?

333
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,260
Everyone wants to be the top scorer, right?

334
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,840
Zhu Yun, are you convinced?

335
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,880
I may be convinced by other top scorers, but him…

336
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,690
See?

337
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,070
I think I'm just fine being normal.

338
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,570
It is extraordinary that you can be admitted to Nanhu University.

339
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,030
Has Li Xun handed in the homework assigned by Old Lin in the last class?

340
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,520
Everyone in the class turned it in except him.

341
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,070
I'm worried about how to explain to Old Lin.

342
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,340
- Well, hurry him up then. 
 - Hurry him up.

343
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,930
I can't even avoid him.

344
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,320
Aren't you afraid Old Lin will yell at you?

345
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,790
Whatever. I'll endure.

346
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,380
Li Xun is always so arrogant and looks down upon others.

347
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,860
Don't you guys wonder what his level really is?

348
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,390
It's so windy here that you can catch cold.

349
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,620
Didn't I tell you not to come up without my permission?

350
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,580
Everyone in the class turned in the homework for C Language except you.

351
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,140
I won't. I didn't do it.

352
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,050
- If you don't turn it in, your usual grade will be deducted. 
 - I don't care.

353
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,110
Are you afraid to hand it in?

354
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,460
Afraid?

355
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,010
Yeah. You appear to be a programming expert who types codes on your computer every day.

356
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,160
What if you hand in your homework with codes full of mistakes?

357
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,550
Wouldn't that be a shame?

358
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,780
So the best thing to do is not to hand it in, right?

359
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,520
Yeah.

360
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Are you so interested in my programming skills?

361
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,590
What if you're just a pretty face?

362
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,100
What is our homework?

363
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,790
Find the maximum of three numbers.

364
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,730
 So long. How come I finished it in less than ten lines? 

365
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,740
Flash drive.

366
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,460
It suits you.

367
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,770
     

368
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,260
   

369
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,370
Coming. Coming.

370
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,950
Got his homework?

371
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,290
I'm pretty sure he's nothing but just a pretty face.

372
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,450
Why?

373
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,390
Isn't the logic of the homework very simple?

374
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,830
It can be done in ten lines of code.

375
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,490
He managed to write a hundred lines.

376
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,970
What is the most important thing about writing code?

377
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,200
It is to be simple.

378
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,830
He made such a simple logic so complicated.

379
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,990
He's just making a mystery out of it. Isn't he just a pretty face?

380
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,460
   

381
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,280
This seems to be a virus.

382
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,820
You have an i7 processor and 16 gigabytes of RAM.

383
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,960
Girl, you are a computer science student. Right?

384
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,540
You can even tell that? You're so experienced.

385
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,260
How can the average student use such a high-configuration computer?

386
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,950
You must have spent a lot of money on it.

387
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,570
Do you think it can be fixed?

388
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,020
Fool, don't bother me...

389
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,250
Isn't it just a little virus?

390
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,740
No sweat. Five minutes.

391
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,060
- I'll have it fixed in five minutes. 
 - Okay.

392
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,090
   

393
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,500
Girl, is Old Lin still the head of our department?

394
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,390
Are you my senior?

395
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,890
I was admitted in 2001.

396
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,760
You must be a freshman.

397
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,660
Well, don't worry.

398
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,450
The Computer Science Department of our college is famous,

399
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,790
so it'll be very easy for you to find a job later.

400
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,640
I used to work for a tech giant.

401
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,840
Then, why don't you work there anymore?

402
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,550
Well, it sounds nice.

403
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,790
To put it bluntly, I was still like a migrant worker on the internet.

404
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,870
That job consumed youth, hair, and waist.

405
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,590
Those in their thirties there looked like they were in their fifties,

406
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,760
and they were either in the office or in the ER.

407
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,960
Those who don't want to die young should change careers.

408
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,220
   

409
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,110
   

410
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,760
   

411
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,970
Well, who did this to you?

412
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,170
One of my classmates.

413
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,860
- Who? 
 - One of my classmates.

414
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,600
One of your classmates?

415
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,950
No way. How many classes have you freshmen taken in C language?

416
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,340
How is it possible to make it?

417
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,080
Wait a minute.

418
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,870
I have a virus here. Yeah, I can't handle it with my flash drive.

419
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,190
Change it. Change it. Change it. Take it easy.

420
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,500
Change it. Change it. Change it.

421
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,480
- Yes.  
 - It works. It works.

422
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
It works. It works. It works.

423
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,380
It works.

424
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,030
   

425
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,900
I think maybe we should reinstall the system in this case.

426
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,720
- Why did you call me here in such a hurry? 
 - Secretary Zhang, quick. Come on. Come here.

427
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,880
Your turn. Change it with yours.

428
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,790
Here. Come here.

429
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,740
Use your secret skill. Here. Be quick.

430
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,920
-  Have you done it the usual way? 
 - Yes. It didn't work.

431
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,340
That's it. That's where it changes.

432
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,700
- Here, it's going to pop out. 
 -  Was it made by the guy who created the panda joss-stick virus?

433
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,130
Her classmate.

434
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,160
Which year is her classmate in?

435
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
First year.

436
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,630
It's impossible. This is absolutely impossible.

437
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,360
Indeed. If… none of us can solve it.

438
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,380
If her classmate could do that, what else is he going to college for?

439
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,260
Am I right? That's very professional. It's way beyond our level.

440
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,750
Try again. Try again. Try again.

441
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,180
Why not ask him to meet us?

442
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,650
Okay, okay, okay.

443
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,120
Girl.

444
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,980
You done?

445
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,500
Not yet.

446
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,290
Would you introduce your classmate to us?

447
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,520
Yeah, introduce him to us.

448
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,820
Let's communicate with him. Get him here, so we can talk.

449
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,780
Yeah. We want to make friends with him.

450
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,030
Isn't it fixed?

451
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,420
Old Gao, here's your chance to practice.

452
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,430
   

453
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,980
   

454
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,080
   

455
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,990
Oh, no. It totally turned into a brick.

456
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:15,160
Zhu Yun, why don't you bring Li Xun over to tell us how to remove this virus?

457
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,290
I won't ask him for help even if it turns into a brick.

458
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,150
I'm going to the library to look things up.

459
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,020
It's just one virus. I just don't buy it.

460
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,860
Give it up.

461
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,280
Li Xun is really a genius.

462
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,330
He deserves to be the top scorer.

463
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,380
Fang Shumiao, do you have a conscience?

464
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,770
If someone has no character, no matter how high his IQ is,

465
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,100
he won't succeed.

466
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,580
Yun, what about your homework?

467
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,810
Oh, no. Old Lin is still waiting for me in the office.

468
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,980
You didn't write a virus

469
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,620
to keep from turning in your homework, did you?

470
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,270
Don't make an excuse.

471
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,020
Let me see what kind of virus it is.

472
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,410
Who wrote it?

473
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,050
Li Xun.

474
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,520
   

475
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,670
Li Xun,

476
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,110
you wrote it yourself?

477
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,420
You brat.

478
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,160
Hurry up.

479
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,850
Hurry up. Take a seat.

480
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,630
Take a seat.

481
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,120
Li Xun, tell me how you wrote it in detail.

482
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,830
It's just a worm.

483
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,170
Worm?

484
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,690
Are you fooling me?

485
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,610
Don't hide it from me.

486
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,020
I've just patched and fixed the zero-day. 
  (is a broad term that describes recently discovered security vulnerabilities that hackers can use to attack systems.) 

487
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,480
What else should I do?

488
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,570
You can't solve it by reinstalling the system either.

489
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,490
I planted a virus in every disk.

490
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,520
Every disk?

491
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,180
Go on.

492
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,590
I just want to try to make something like the panda joss-stick virus

493
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:45,520
that can infect exe, com, pif, src, html, and asp files,

494
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,620
terminate the anti-virus software and delete the backup files of the backup restore tool

495
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,410
so that the system can't be reinstalled.

496
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,390
You're terrible.

497
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,120
Do you want to bring down all the computers in our college?

498
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,350
But the panda joss-stick virus was still too low-tech and not subtle.

499
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,550
The more insidious the virus, the better.

500
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,800
What exactly are you planning to do?

501
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:16,460
Sir, in fact, now a virus is to obtain user information,

502
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,520
hijack the browser to install some programs, or take it as a botnet.

503
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,880
But a single computer is not worth much as a botnet.

504
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,560
What is there to steal from the average computer user?

505
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,510
That isn't worth attacking.

506
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,200
But the average person also has a lot of things on their computer that they don't want to lose;

507
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,720
such as, graduation papers, family photos, designs, and company documents.

508
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,890
All of these can generate exchange value.

509
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,200
For example, the 2008 Conficker is actually the same thing. 
  (A computer worm targeting the Microsoft Windows operating system.) 

510
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,310
It's just that it spread on the internet.

511
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,030
The firewalls are getting smarter,

512
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,430
less vulnerable and harder to attack.

513
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,110
But the Automator virus is still very efficient.

514
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,550
Exactly.

515
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,730
So I made this computer a source of infection.

516
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,130
She'll get different people working on the virus.

517
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,220
Every time the system is reinstalled, it'll be connected to a different hard drive

518
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,750
and the virus will have direct access to the information.

519
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:24,000
Sir, did you just reinstall her system with your hard drive, too?

520
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,190
I was set up by you.

521
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,920
Don't worry, I only wrote the hack, not the extract.

522
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,810
Li Xun, tell me all about it.

523
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,160
I heard the worm has mutated.

524
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,680
Indeed.

525
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,690
Now, Windows XP operating system still has vulnerabilities.

526
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,810
Put this formula here. Go over here again.

527
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,460
Then add another line.

528
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,880
Then repeat…

529
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,780
Sir, your phone is ringing.

530
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,040
- If…  
 - Your call.

531
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Hello.

532
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,950
Old Lin, what time is it and you still haven't come back?

533
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,190
 I forgot my house key. Come back now. 

534
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,730
Why did you forget the key again?

535
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,630
Fine. All right, all right.

536
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,000
I… I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

537
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,570
Sorry, it's my wife.

538
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,750
Here about this? I'll talk to you some other time.

539
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,480
Okay.

540
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,110
Class rep, why are you still here?

541
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,020
Sir, that virus.

542
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,630
Sorry. Sorry.

543
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,140
Li Xun, solve it now.

544
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,900
Okay.

545
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,550
- Goodbye, sir. 
 - Goodbye. Goodbye.

546
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,550
Li Xun.

547
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,800
Li Xun.

548
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,630
You've arrived.

549
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,850
Are you going to solve it or not?

550
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,430
What time is it?

551
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,350
Stop pulling him. Let him go, girl.

552
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,920
Go back. Go back.

553
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,500
Let me go, girl.

554
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,110
Mr. Lin asked you to help me.

555
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,570
I just made it very clear in the office.

556
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,020
- You can't even remember that? 
 - I can't understand it even if I remembered it.

557
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,400
You don't understand it, do you?

558
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,220
I thought every class rep was excellent.

559
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,530
It seems that your interest group didn't teach you anything, either.

560
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,000
Will you do it or not?

561
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,490
What if I say no?

562
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,800
Are you still going to tell the teacher?

563
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,780
Li Xun, I admit I'm not as good as you.

564
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,380
I sincerely seek your help.

565
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,040
Will you help me to fix it? Okay?

566
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:28,030
Zhu Yun, you should study hard as you're worse than me.

567
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,040
What scum!

568
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,690
What happened?

569
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,950
It's just a virus. I don't believe I can't solve it.

570
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,780
   

571
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,380
Yun, get up.

572
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,450
- I'm not going. 
 - How can you not go?

573
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,860
- You're trying to kill me. 
 - I can't get up. I don't have the strength to get up.

574
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,480
- Hurry up. 
 - I'm not going.

575
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,390
Yun, the teacher will call the roll.

576
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,660
Come on up.

577
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,850
I don't want to go.

578
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,000
What am I supposed to do without you? The credits will be deducted.

579
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,080
Get up. I'll wash your face.

580
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,170
Get up and I'll wash your face.

581
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,820
What's wrong?

582
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,620
   

583
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,150
   

584
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,870
   

585
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,990
   

586
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,350
   

587
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,750
Is it that simple?

588
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,150
Old Gao is awesome. He really figured it out

589
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,860
Go and wash yourself.

590
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,490
 There is no end to learning. 

591
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,780
 The library will be closed soon. 

592
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,120
 Welcome to Nanhu University Library again. 

593
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:08,360
The lamb kebabs from Adao are tasty.

594
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,040
I just want to say thank you. I solved the virus.

595
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,220
You talked to Mr. Lin about the virus.

596
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,540
Old Gao and I looked into it and really solved it.

597
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,350
Although the virus was also thanks to you, we learned something at least. Thanks.

598
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,100
Li Xun, you get good grades and know how to program.

599
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,970
In fact, morning self-study is a time for us to communicate with each other.

600
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,800
Would you like to come and tutor your classmates?

601
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,630
I have no time.

602
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,990
The scholarship the school paid me isn't for tutoring my classmates.

603
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,260
But you're always absent from it.

604
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,400
It is a hot potato for Fang Shumiao, the monitor.

605
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,310
Do you know that the counselor has talked to her several times because of it?

606
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,000
If this goes on, our class won't be awarded merit

607
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,700
and Fang Shumiao won't get extra marks for the postgraduate recommendation.

608
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,100
She may be unhappy for the next four years because you don't go to the morning self-study.

609
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:20,350
I know you don't care if your marks are deducted,

610
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,240
but we are a group.

611
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,340
You still have to think about others. Right?

612
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,180
I knew you weren't so cold-blooded.

613
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,130
Well, many students slack off once they get to college

614
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,130
and waste four years of college.

615
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,720
- In fact, it is important to study in the morning. 
 - Are you done?

616
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,740
Yes.

617
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,230
So you said yes?

618
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,850
Yes to what?

619
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,800
Do I have to give my heart to you after eating ten of your lamb kebabs?

620
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,480
Are you unwilling to leave?

621
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,760
That's all right. I don't have to go back to the dorm.

622
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,830
I… I didn't take my phone.

623
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,480
Open the door.

624
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,640
As a man, you don't follow school rules and make others suffer the consequences.

625
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,160
Do you have any sense of responsibility?

626
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,810
Open the door and give me my phone.

627
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,000
Open it.

628
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,810
You!

629
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,190
Don't answer my phone.

630
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,250
Stop.

631
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,300
- Hello. 
  - Hello, Yun. 

632
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,050
 Is Shumiao with you? 

633
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,920
Sorry.

634
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,160
Zhu Yun is busy right now.

635
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,040
 I am sorry to interrupt. 

636
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,190
Will you open the door?

637
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,010
I will drag you to the morning self-study.

638
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,220
Don't play any tricks on me.

639
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,820
You can't keep it closed forever.

640
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,850
I'm going to wait for you to open it.

641
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:57,010


642
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,340
What a fool.

643
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,320
   

644
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,050
♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

645
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,000
 You don't have to keep an eye on me. 

646
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,160
 We can be together in the open. 

647
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,420
 You really gave yourself up? 

648
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,390
 He'll do anything to play tricks on me. 

649
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,690
 You clarified the fact? 

650
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,670
 Did his golden hair fade? 

651
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,420
 He didn't really dye his hair black for you, did he? 

652
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,900
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

653
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,820
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

654
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,680
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

655
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:52,380
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

656
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:58,100
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

657
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,580
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

658
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:09,620
♫  We will not separate  ♫

659
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:14,740
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

660
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,180
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

661
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,220
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

662
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:30,080
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

663
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,960
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

664
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,420
♫  True love will take its course ♫

665
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,620
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

666
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,200
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

667
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,860
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

668
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,220
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

669
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,700
♫  That hot firework  ♫

670
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:13,900
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

671
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,260
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

672
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,180
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

673
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,080
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

674
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,660
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

675
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,900
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

676
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,380
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

677
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,600
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

678
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,200
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

679
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:05,880
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

680
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,360
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

681
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,780

686
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:37,020
