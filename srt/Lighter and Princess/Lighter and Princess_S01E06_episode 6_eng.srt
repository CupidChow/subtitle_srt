00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:16,090


2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,220
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,440
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,780
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,000
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,080
   

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,810
Ren Di.

23
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,000
You're shopping? You are seldom so free.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,830
It is the weekend and I didn't join the base, so I'm here to shop.

25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,250
You're also shopping? Want to together?

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,250
I'm waiting for someone.

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,300
You have an appointment?

28
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,370
- I'm leaving. 
 - You're leaving?

29
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,040
Do you think Zhu Yun has changed?

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,740
She has changed?

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,690
She was even tired of working as the class rep in the past,

32
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,960
but she was bold to make fun of you through a talk show.

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
She also dares to scold me.

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,060
You're also different.

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,860
In the past, you only had your own goals in your heart

36
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,400
but you competed with them by betting some days ago.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,940
Li Xun, what's going on?

38
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,470
Is it a trick or an accident?

39
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,720
I have a plan.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,670
Any accidents are unlikely to occur in this plan.

41
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,370
Understand?

42
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,650
I see.

43
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,870
Let's go. The house I rented is right ahead.

44
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,500
Let's go.

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,970
Thanks.

46
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,640
Fang Shumiao, how many members does your project group have?

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,250
Just me and Wu Mengxing.

48
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,240
I'll add you later.

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm leaving.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,950
- Li Xun, eoes Ren Di usually come to work on projects? 
 - She won't.

51
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,570
Why add her name?

52
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,040
I want her to gain some credits.

53
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,350
I don't want those who won't work to join my group.

54
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,130
Let's talk about it after you make an achievement.

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,250
It's demanding to transfer to another school.

56
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,670
The school even requires students to know art.

57
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,010
    
 The website of our university is so bad.

58
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,870
    
 It's not smooth at all.

59
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,680
Are there too many references to pictures?

60
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,650
You're finally back.

61
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,400
I've watched all the episodes of "Game of Thrones,"

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,490
washed all my clothes, and I've even taken out the trash twice.

63
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm so bored.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,620
You can join the base.

65
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,700
There are so many people working on mixed projects and few working.

66
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,720
What's wrong with you? Who offended you?

67
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,110
Ren Di, given your absence from base activities,

68
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,000
even if you join my project group, you won't gain credits.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,140
You're crazy about working as a manager?

70
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,210
You do nothing. Why do you join my group?

71
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,330
Profit by our toil?

72
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,600
I've always concealed your absence from morning self-study and all-night staying-out,

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,010
but you didn't even thank me.

74
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,330
Did I ask you to do so?

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,980
If I were not the monitor, I wouldn't have done so.

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,350
I didn't vote for you in the monitor election,

77
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,300
so I don't need to listen to you.

78
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,760
You're unreasonable.

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,540
You might as well drop out and become a day student.

80
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,270
Anyway, you seldom attend classes and come back to our dorm. You wasted resources!

81
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,960
Don't be angry.

82
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,700
Bad girl. She is ungrateful.

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,680
You've long known her temper.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,380
She's more unreasonable and ungrateful than Li Xun.

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,640
They're really a perfect match.

86
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,160
What do you mean?

87
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,730
She's with Li Xun.

88
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,430
She always comes to the base for Li Xun late at night.

89
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,100
Li Xun is indifferent to everyone,

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,960
but he always listens to her

91
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,060
and stays with her all night.

92
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,650
What can a man and a woman do together?

93
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,640
They're both adults. It's common for them.

94
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,960
When I went shopping today, I also encountered them.

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,100
They always play such tricks.

96
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,630
I thought she was so punk and chic,

97
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,040
but she actually also cares about the credits offered by the base.

98
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,660
Are Ren Di and Li Xun really together?

99
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,550
They're both like ice cubes.

100
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,960
Being together, they'll freeze to death.

101
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,640
You don't believe my words. I won't talk about it with you.

102
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,880
Are you moving? So many things.

103
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,800
I won't live here.

104
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,940
You'll move to another dorm?

105
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't mind Fang Shumiao's words.

106
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,420
She didn't mean to hurt you.

107
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,300
She is just straightforward.

108
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,550
Don't be impulsive.

109
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,760
Do you always think you're Fang Shumiao's assistant?

110
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,990
I won't move to another dorm.

111
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,890
That's good.

112
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,120
Then what are you doing with so many things?

113
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,030
I've dropped out.

114
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,550
In my junior year of senior high school, my father had promised me that

115
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,080
I can do what I want to do, such as playing the guitar and forming a band,

116
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,070
and live as I like, as long as I can be admitted to a university.

117
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,900
You've come here but suddenly dropped out.

118
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
You're different.

119
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,630
Everyone is different.

120
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,810
Fang Shumiao was right. I did waste resources.

121
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,690
I shouldn't waste my four years.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,140
Then I won't see you anymore.

123
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,510
What? I'm not dead.

124
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,330
I've rented a house as a studio nearby.

125
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,550
Come and visit it when you're free.

126
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,470
Ren Di, take care.

127
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,410
You are living with Li Xun now, you have to protect yourself.

128
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,230
I'm serious.

129
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,470
Fang Shumiao told it to you?

130
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,550
I guessed it.

131
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,960
How did you guess it?

132
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,940
Just because you met us by chance in the street?

133
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,710
I'm telling you a secret.

134
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,480
I don't like Li Xun,

135
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,720
but Fang Shumiao likes him.

136
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,440
When did that happen?

137
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,710
I think that's why she stays at the base.

138
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,070
After all, her brain is struggling with Li Xun's project.

139
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,460
But it's useless, she can't last long.

140
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,830
Common women can't insist on going after Li Xun.

141
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm leaving.

142
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,730
Ren Di.

143
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,440
You're brave. Really good.

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,680
Zhu Yun, actually, you're braver than me,

145
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,180
but you haven't realized it yet.

146
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,120
Ren Di no longer lives in our dorm.

147
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,790
You should have believed my words.

148
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,970
She has dropped out.

149
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,530
It's not enough to talk about love?

150
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,000
She is going all in.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,810
She said she was not with Li Xun.

152
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,200
She doesn't live with him, either.

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
I see.

154
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,690
But it's unnecessary to drop out.

155
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,600
Forget it. It's none of my business.

156
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,680
I don't need to worry about her.

157
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,400
Anyway, she didn't vote for me in the monitor election.

158
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,660
Can you speak unbiasedly?

159
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,010
i don't like her and she doesn't like me.

160
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,550
Well, check this for me.

161
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,220
You're practicing website development?

162
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,810
Some functions are indeed very difficult.

163
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,150
    
 Blue Crown Foods Co., Ltd.

164
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,850
Look at this.

165
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,080
The functions required in it are simply not what we can do now.

166
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,660
Li Xun said that only after completing the project can we gain credits.

167
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,630
But-But I can't finish this.

168
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,450
So? Are you going to quit?

169
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,140
I don't think so.

170
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,950
Forget it. Forget it. Go. Let's go for a meal.

171
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,980
How about I help you?

172
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,450
   

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,020
   

174
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,020
  How is it? 

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,800
   
   

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,450
 He said it's unqualified. 

177
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,120
Zhu Yun.

178
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,840
Why are you here?

179
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,540
Why is that program unqualified?

180
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,450
Zhu Yun.

181
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,570
I'm asking for her.

182
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,930
You waste her painstaking efforts for no reason.

183
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,340
She stayed up late for that program. You denied it with one word.

184
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,810
Why don't you give me a reason?

185
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,120
But anything that can be said to be bad is still worth something of value.

186
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,830
That program...

187
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,950
looks good but is actually unpractical and valueless.

188
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,940
It's elementary school level.

189
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,660
Stop that. Stop that. Forget it.

190
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm not angry, so you don't need to be angry, either.

191
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,480
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

192
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't be angry.

193
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,860
Actually, the website has been completed.

194
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,730
The base has a dozen members,

195
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,690
but the core team only includes Li Xun and Old Gao.

196
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,080
I don't think your program is bad.

197
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,240
Your idea may be different from theirs.

198
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,740
What's their idea? It's enough that my program has the required functions.

199
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,040
Why are our ideas different?

200
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,130
I don't know.

201
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,440
Well, don't be angry.

202
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,010
I've gained the credits.

203
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,180
At least, we've achieved our goal.

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,500
Let's go to West Street.

205
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,220
This project has finally been completed.

206
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,100
I've had enough of programming.

207
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,190
- Let's go. 
 - I can't give in.

208
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,950
What?

209
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,090
Where are you going?

210
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,730
   

211
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,520
You wrote it well.

212
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,110
Zhu Yun, I found that your code is very short.

213
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,310
Have you simplified it several times?

214
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,540
You told us to simplify codes as far as possible.

215
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,010
Yes, I said so.

216
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,810
In the first class, I had told you not to persist in new skills

217
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,280
but to focus on the overall situation.

218
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,680
Zhu Yun, do you like programming?

219
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,100
Why did you choose this major?

220
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,060
My mother chose it for me.

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,910
I've seen many students like you.

222
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,950
You have a good family and also get good grades.

223
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,290
You grew up without suffering,

224
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,770
but you may suddenly find that you don't know what you want.

225
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,920
Think it over.

226
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,140
If you really like programming,

227
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,380
you can try to approach Li Xun.

228
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,660
Why?

229
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,260
Have you read "Harry Potter"?

230
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,510
Sometimes I feel Li Xun is like the Mirror of Erised.

231
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,840
When you stand in front of him, you can know the deepest desire of your heart.

232
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,750
He's too aggressive and persistent.

233
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:39,060
In front of him, you may be prone to think about what you really want.

234
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,580
This base is non-profit-making.

235
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,680
You can do exercises there in your spare time.

236
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,170
You can learn a lot.

237
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,060
The judgment branch of the third module is good.

238
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,010
Class Rep, shouldn't you listen to Mr. Lin?

239
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,160
What do you mean?

240
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,890
Would you like to join us?

241
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,240
If you join us, I'll welcome you.

242
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,160
What do you mean by that?

243
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,060
7:00 a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late.

244
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,690
 Did he invite me? 

245
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,760
 So this is a game to lose. Yeah. 

246
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,030
 Why did you want me to play it? 

247
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,050
 I don't like you. 

248
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,550
 Class Rep, shouldn't you listen to Mr. Lin? 

249
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,250
 Would you like to join us? 

250
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,130
 If you join us, I'll welcome you. 

251
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,150
 Is this the joy of life? 

252
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,310
 It's so pleasant. 

253
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,820
 Have you finished that document? 

254
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,550
 Not yet. 

255
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,720
 Check it for me by then. 

256
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,100
The spicy hotpot was very delicious.

257
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Yun Yun, why are you here?

258
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,960
Aren't you required to be here at 7:00?

259
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,920
No, we're not required.

260
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,790
We can come and leave at any time.

261
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,450
What happened?

262
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,270
You also joined the base?

263
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,350
Li Xun invited me here.

264
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,150
Wu Mengxing and Fang Shumiao, you two continue writing from yesterday.

265
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,010
What about me?

266
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,540
Well, if he doesn't entrust you with any task, you can do anything you want.

267
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,040
Why don't you play for awhile?

268
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,280
The internet speed here is so fast that it can play any game.

269
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,300
But why did I get up at 6:00 a.m. for playing a game here?

270
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,930
Come on. Do her a favor.

271
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,870
Do homework for her. Do it casually.

272
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,270
Casually?

273
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,320
Not casually?

274
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,420
Junior, translate an art paper for me.

275
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,620
Senior, which one do you want to translate?

276
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,330
Just this.

277
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,660
   
  

278
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,170
This is not an art paper but an individual resume.

279
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,780
It doesn't matter, as long as I can hand it in as our homework.

280
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,420
Okay.

281
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,630
This artist looks pretty clean.

282
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,870
Then it's up to you, Junior.

283
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,790
   
  

284
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,670
 You're on fire. 

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,280
You've finished?

286
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,310
Anything else?

287
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,220
No wonder you're the class rep. You finished homework so soon.

288
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,620
I'm not here for doing homework for others.

289
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,520
You just did her a favor.

290
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,720
Don't forget that you invited me here.

291
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,820
 Did you forget that you invited me? 

292
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,680
 Don't pretend to forget it. 

293
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,440
- I see. 
  - What I see? 

294
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,590
Everyone, come!

295
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,140
Stop, stop, stop.

296
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,960
Pause.

297
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,550
I have something to announce.

298
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,370
- Come here, Zhu Yun. 
 - What do you want to do?

299
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,990
Come here.

300
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,850
I announce, this is the princess I invited here.

301
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,060
I'll treat you to dinner to welcome her tonight.

302
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,840
Thank you. No need.

303
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,120
That won't work.

304
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,780
After all, you were invited here.

305
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,350
No one can wrong Her Royal Highness, right?

306
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,980
 I must have offended all your families in my previous life. 

307
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,210
   

308
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,620
♫  Bell tower rings. Pigeons are pure white  ♫

309
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,170
♫  Gulp freedom and ease  ♫

310
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,340
♫  Shrimp soldiers and crab generals are busy  ♫

312
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,560
♫  I'm standing in an empty square  ♫

313
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,730
♫  I look at martyrs' statues with reverence  ♫

314
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,160
What would you like?

315
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,360
- Beer. 
 - Water.

316
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,630
- Okay. 
 - Anything is okay.

317
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,240
- What would you like? 
 - I'll have-I'll have water.

318
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,220
♫  Bell tower rings. Pigeons fly across the square  ♫

♫  Looking at the sky, I don't think anything  ♫

♫  With traces left  ♫

♫  In the dark night, I keep chasing  ♫ 
 Ren Di?

324
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,590
That's really her.

325
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,720
So cool.

326
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,900
♫  Shrimp soldiers and crab generals murmur  ♫

327
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,620
♫  They persist in believing that they've never pretended  ♫

328
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,030
♫  I'm standing in an empty square  ♫

329
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,320
Would you like something else to eat?

330
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,760
♫  I hear the firmest heartbeat  ♫

331
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,180
♫  How can I surrender easily?  ♫

332
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,600
♫  Bell tower rings. Pigeons fly across the square  ♫

333
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,000
♫  Looking at the sky, I don't think anything  ♫

334
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,660
♫  Bell tower rings. Pigeons fly across the square  ♫

335
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,860
♫  With traces left  ♫

336
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,240
♫  Bell tower rings. Pigeons fly across the square  ♫

337
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,780
♫  Looking at the sky, I don't think anything  ♫

338
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,940
♫  With traces left  ♫

339
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,360
 Once more! 

340
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,380
- Did you have a good time? 
 - You sing here?

341
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,900
Yeah, we've been singing here.

342
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,290
He is studying here.

343
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,290
- They don't have anything to eat. Go fetch something. 
 - Okay.

344
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,530
Hey, stop that.

345
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,650
Li Xun is busy flirting. He has no time to supervise you.

346
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm not doing this for him to see.

347
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,940
Besides, who will come to the base? Is it really worth it for those credits?

348
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,710
Pointing at the mulberry tree and cursing the locust tree? 
  (Idiom: indirect scolding) 

349
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,610
What are you doing?

350
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,840
I designed all the web pages of Blue Crown.

351
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,910
Take a look. What do you think?

352
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,100
Aren't these determined by Li Xun?

353
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,100
He just talked about it roughly, and I was responsible for all the practical operations.

354
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,300
I wrote all the codes.

355
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,700
They exhausted me, but I have a sense of achievement.

356
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Aren't we going to learn flash next week? But you've applied it.

357
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,200
So I said students of our major need to take part in exercises.

358
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,300
If Old Gao is an employee, his employer will definitely be happy.

359
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,800
It's my project. Of course, I'm working hard for it.

360
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,100
What's more, we joined the base for mutual learning.

361
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,200
No one is the boss.

362
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,300
Then if I entered the base, I will do this too?

363
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,400
Impossible. You just joined us.

364
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,200
You definitely won't do any core project.

365
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,300
Yeah. Don't be anxious.

366
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,000
Li Xun just speaks bitingly, but we can really learn something in the base.

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,600
That being said, it's only been a day and I regret it a bit.

368
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,300
With us here, don't regret it.

369
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,700
So good.

370
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,200
Block her later.

371
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,500
Understand?

372
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,900
- Coming. Coming. Come on. 
 - Excuse me.

373
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,000
- Don't go. 
 - Don't go.

374
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,600
Tell us your phone number, girl.

375
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
What do you want to do? I'll call the police.

376
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,700
Another girl.

377
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,100
Why did you come out of the men's room?

378
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,800
- What did you do in the men's room? 
 - Go away!

379
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,400
Are you a man or a woman?

380
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Let's inspect the goods.

381
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,200
What do you want to do? Go away!

382
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,600
Go away!

383
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,200
- I-I can go by myself. 
 - Li Xun, I'm sending Old Wu back.

384
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't help me. I don't need help.

385
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,300
You can't let it be. I'm going to buy medicines.

386
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,900
- You were fired? 
 - Yeah, it's a given.

387
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,200
We can sing somewhere else.

388
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Were you sure you could defeat them?

389
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You shouldn't have taken action. Don't you have self-knowledge?

390
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,300
But she was your friend.

391
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
I'm sorry. Thank you.

392
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
It's my fault.

393
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
It doesn't matter. It's not your fault.

394
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
It's none of your business.

395
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,300
Take a break.

396
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Apply medicine.

397
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Annoying.

398
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
I had a really fulfilling day.

399
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,900
What are you mumbling?

400
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,200
Nothing.

401
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,500
Be frank.

402
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,400
You'd be likable.

403
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,900
What are you thinking?

404
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,600
Say it out.

405
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,400
Can you help her with her homework in the future?

406
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,800
It's your duty to help your girlfriend with her homework.

407
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,600
I'm under no obligation to do it for her.

408
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
So?

409
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,900
If you ask me to do this again, I'll quit.

410
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,900
That's all. I'm leaving.

411
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,700
Come when you want, leave when you want.

412
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,000
It doesn't make sense to me.

413
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,900
Let go of me. Your girlfriend will come back soon.

414
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
Who said she is my girlfriend?

415
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,500
Isn't she?

416
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,400
Stretch out your hand.

417
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Check it after going back.

418
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,600
    
 To Your Highness.

419
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,500
 The logic of this module all depends on "go to". 

420
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,200
 Have you thrown away the function you learned? 

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,500
 You wrote so many codes. 

422
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,100
 What if I can't page up or down on my computer? 

423
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,800
 Your annotation is too long. 

424
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
 You write the codes as diaries? 

425
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,200
 Who do you want to talk to? Your computer? 

426
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
 What a bad name! 

427
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
A name should be simple.

428
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,300
 Verb and noun should be used properly. 

429
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,600
 How did he know that I wrote this function? 

430
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,500
   

431
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400

 That program... 

435
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,300
 looks good 

436
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,030
  but is actually unpractical and valueless. 

437
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,900
 It's elementary school level. 

438
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,100
 Stop that. Stop that. Forget it. 

439
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,200

 It turns out that he was modifying my program this afternoon. 

448
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,400
  7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

465
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Can you push my chair forward for me?

466
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay.

467
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,300
Your hard drive has bad tracks?

468
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,600
Your notebook starts up so slowly.

469
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,300
Lighter.

470
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,000
Why do you always bring a lighter?

471
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,000
You're so interested in my affairs?

472
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,100
Browse this.

473
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,000
    
 Requirements of that website?

474
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,300
I have two kinds of projects, i.e. common and special ones.

475
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,400
They offer different credits.

476
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,700
I applied for a special one for you.

477
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,000
What's a special one?

478
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The special one is profitable.

479
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Can we share the money?

480
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,900
Thinking beautifully

481
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,800
Have you heard of the Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation?

482
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,500
Every school should have one. The schools cooperate with enterprises.

483
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,200
But I heard that the schools earned a little money.

484
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,800
Fang Shumiao said that the money earned by the School of Management

485
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,000
is only enough to pay venue use and management fees.

486
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,600
So does our school.

487
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,000
We also need to share the money with our school.

488
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
How much can we get?

489
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,700
It turns out that you also want to make money.

490
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,200
I'm here for the money.

491
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,700
You seem to not care about money at ordinary times.

492
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,800
So it's not true.

493
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,200
Compared with you, I feel ashamed of my ability.

494
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,600
All the members here are making money for you,

495
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
while I'm at best insignificant.

496
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,000
It's vulgar.

497
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Say that again.

498
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,700
- You misunderstood. 
 - Say that again.

499
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,800
- You misunderstood. 
 - Say it.

500
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
- You misunderstood. 
 - Say it.

501
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,100
- I didn't mean that. 
 - Say that again.

502
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,900
- Well, I just... 
 - What did you mean?

503
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,500
- I'm going to answer a call of nature. 
 - Don't run.

504
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,800
You're not vulgar.

505
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,400
Miss Zhu,

506
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
what's wrong with me?

507
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
Nothing. You're good.

508
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,900
They're coming.

509
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,000
Who is afraid, you or I?

510
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,100
 Monitor Fang, treat me to breakfast. 

511
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
 Don't ask. 

512
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Princess, come here.

513
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,600
Princess,

514
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,400
come with your belongings and have a seat.

515
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,000
From now on, you work with me for the project.

516
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,800
What's the project?

517
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,700
The Blue Crown's project.

518
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
Class Rep, you're awesome.

519
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,400
You just joined us, but you can now engage in Blue Crown's project.

520
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,100
Good. At least, what we learned ourselves weren't in vain.

521
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,600
Zhu Yun and Old Gao, come for a meeting.

522
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,900
Is it necessary?

523
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,200
I agree with Old Gao.

524
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Enjoy your food.

525
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,100
Actually, Old Gao's program is okay.

526
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,500
No need to abandon it.

527
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,900
We must rewrite one.

528
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,200
We can't give it to the company.

529
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,800
Well, which part is unqualified?

530
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,300
On the whole, I think it's okay.

531
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,000
We just need to modify its details and logic.

532
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,300
What's more, we don't have enough time to rewrite one.

533
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,900
There is no problem with its overall logic.

534
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,200
First, we don't have enough time to rewrite one.

535
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,700
Second, we don't have any better idea.

536
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,400
So it's unnecessary to waste time rewriting one.

537
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,200
I say redo it, so redo it.

538
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Well, Li Xun, although you brought in this project, you didn’t do it alone.

539
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Now that we agreed to cooperate, we have to make a decision after negotiation.

540
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,500
If only you have the say, we can't work together anymore.

541
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,300
Am I right?

542
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Okay, I'll listen to you.

543
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
- I'll write it with you. 
 - Okay.

544
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,700
In my opinion, this part of the logic is right,

545
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,800
and you just need to modify it and add some details.

546
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,600
- I'm responsible for this part. 
  - Okay. 

547
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,300
 - You write the following part. 
 -  No problem. 

548
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
 You're here. 

549
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,300
 - Morning. 
 - Good morning. 

550
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
 Did you have breakfast? 

551
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
Check this page again.

552
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,400
Sit with me.

553
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
I'm talking to you.

554
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,400
Do y-you have something to say?

555
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Weren't you deaf just now?

556
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,700
- I'm out. 
  - You're leaving? 

557
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Did I allow you to leave?

558
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,900
It's half past ten. If I don't go back now, I'll be locked out.

559
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,400
You can stay here all night.

560
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
You must finish this module tonight.

561
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,400
Can I write it in my dorm?

562
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,600
Won't you disconnect from the internet in the dorm?

563
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,400
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

564
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,200
Where is this? Where were you going?

565
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,600
We're all going to be here for the next week.

566
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,200
Exploiter Li. He exploits labor before he becomes a capitalist.

567
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
What we do is for the project.

568
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,500
What happened to you and Fang Shumiao?

569
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,700
Don't ask me about it. Go and write codes.

570
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
Sour.

571
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,400
This orange is really sour.

572
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Li Xun, I bring you breakfast.

573
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,900
Have some.

574
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,800
These are all very delicious.

575
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
Have a taste.

576
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,000
You stayed up late again, right?

577
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,900
Then, drink some coffee. Okay?

578
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,700
Refresh yourself.

579
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
Sit still!

580
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,400
Stop watching.

581
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,700
Fang Shumiao.

582
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,600
Your little crappy program runs a user interface and starts 20 child processes at the same time.

583
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
Do you know what you wrote?

584
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,100
Can't you just talk nicely? Why do you have to have this attitude?

585
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,400
If you can't stand it, you can leave!

586
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Don't waste my time!

587
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Li Xun, she just wrote the wrong codes.

588
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,500
You went too far.

589
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,700
I was right.

590
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,100
You can only play house in your interest group.

591
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,400
If you can't bear such pressure,

592
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,600
you're neither eligible for nor capable of joining this base.

593
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
The same to you all.

594
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,800
Work hard in this base.

595
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,400
If you can't stand the pressure, leave early.

596
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Don't cry in front of me.

597
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,900
I don't want to coax a kid.

598
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,600
Shumiao.

599
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,000
Li Xun, you're too self-righteous.

600
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,100
Shumiao, even if Li Xun was angry, he still went too far.

601
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,000
Forget it.

602
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Will you quit it for me?

603
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,200
What do you mean?

604
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,700
You suffered nothing in the base.

605
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Li Xun didn't scold you but involved you in the core project instead.

606
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,000
Why don't you quit it?

607
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,300
Fang Shumiao, speak your mind.

608
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,700
Don't be enigmatic.

609
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,800
No wonder you helped me actively.

610
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,100
It turns out that you had another aim.

611
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,500
Your words are too hurtful.

612
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,700
Didn't I help you before that?

613
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,300
If you help me, you also helped yourself.

614
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,200
Killed two birds with one stone.

615
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,900
Why are you a princess invited while we're the obsessed love fools who actively joined?

616
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,000
Fang Shumiao, if you like Li Xun, go tell him.

617
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,500
You should learn from Liu Sisi and Chen Minmin.

618
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,000
Why are you pointing your anger at me?

619
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,300
Who likes Li Xun?

620
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,100
Who likes him knows in his heart.

621
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,400
Who told you?

622
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,100
Old Gao?

623
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,200
You told Old Gao but didn't tell me.

624
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,600
Now I have nothing.

625
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,900
- Why are you sadder than me? 
 - Do you treat me as your friend?

626
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,100
All right!  All right!

627
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,500
I don't blame you.

628
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,200
It's not my fault. Why do you blame me?

629
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,300
All right! All right!

630
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,200
You are a talented and pretty princess.

631
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,800
You are a gifted and intelligent little princess.

632
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
It's not your fault,

633
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,800
but God gives you everything by force,

634
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,200
so others are always jealous of you.

635
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,000
Fang Shumiao.

636
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,800
Stop that. Stop that. Don't be angry.

637
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,500
After that, I realized something.

638
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,600
I was too blind to like someone as cold and arrogant as Li Xun.

639
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,200
From now on, I solemnly declare that I do not like him anymore.

640
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,700
If you like him, you can go after him.

641
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
I don't like him.

642
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,600
Really?

643
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Anyone who likes him is out of their mind.

644
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,900
Yes, that's true.

645
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,400
Are you not going to the base?

646
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,800
Of course, I'm going.

647
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,900
I didn't scold him before because I went easy on him.

648
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,200
If he dares scold me again, I'll teach him how to behave.

649
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:38,180


650
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,200
   

651
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,800
 Li Xun, we are a team. 

652
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,700
 I treat you like a brother and a comrade. 

653
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,300
 You left me out on stage today to teach me a lesson and let everyone laugh at me. 

654
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,500
 You played me! 

655
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,400
 So all you have to do is listen to me. 

656
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,600
 I quit. 

657
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,200
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

658
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,100
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

659
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,100
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

660
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:18,800
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

661
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,500
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

662
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,900
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

663
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:36,000
♫  We will not separate  ♫

664
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,100
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

665
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,600
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

666
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,600
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

667
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:55,300
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

668
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,400
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

669
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,800
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

670
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,000
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

671
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,600
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

672
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,100
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

673
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,600
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

674
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,000
♫  That hot firework  ♫

675
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:40,600
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

676
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,700
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

677
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:01,400
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

678
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,400
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

679
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,000
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

680
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,100
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

681
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,600
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

682
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,900
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

683
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,500
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

684
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:32,100
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

685
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,700
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

686
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,100
