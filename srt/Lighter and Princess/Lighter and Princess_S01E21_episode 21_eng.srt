00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:15,960


2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,800
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,300
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,700
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,220
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,500
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,400
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,800
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,700
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,100
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,900
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,600
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,000
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,000
   

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
   

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,300
It costs more than 500 yuan staying here one night. I stay here just because it's near the venue.

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,400
Young man, can I cancel the reservation?

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Of course.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,300
I'm also looking for a cheaper hotel.

26
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,400
Do you know where there is a cheaper one?

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,000
I know one, but it's out of the way.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Student, how much farther?

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,400
Of course, generally, cheap guest houses are far away.

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,200
Indeed.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,700
Renxin is really a big hospital.

32
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,400
Dean Han does have a steady hand.

33
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Did you see that?

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
Their equipment is so much more advanced that we can even see the details.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,900
Director, that is not their equipment.

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,400
This is the new medical software that can live broadcast surgery in full HD with multiple cameras.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,800
and can store and play surgical recordings for a long time.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,200
t will be much more convenient for us to play it to students.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The clarity is also high.

40
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,100
   

41
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,700
Let me see how you'll find your sister.

42
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,100
Director Chen, the video of the surgery has been uploaded.

43
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,800
It can be accessed at any time in the future.

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,100
I just watched the whole thing.

45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,800
There were dozens of other hospitals watching it, too.

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,300
You guys did a really good job.

47
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
Now the fourth generation mobile communication technology network has just emerged.

49
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,400
Only the most basic live surgery and remote consultations have been achieved so far.

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
When the fifth generation of mobile technology arrives, remote surgery will be possible.

51
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Technology is moving so fast.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
It's up to you young people.

53
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,100
   

54
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Checked out?

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,600
Who told her to check out?

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
We can't stop a guest from checking out herself.

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Okay. Thank you.

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,400
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

59
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,800
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

60
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
   

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,100
So expensive.

62
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,500
I could buy three of them out there.

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,400
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

64
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
 Please redial later. 

65
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,900
   

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
I'll take these.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,500
How much is this doll?

68
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,200
45 yuan.

69
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll take it, too.

70
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
45 yuan.

71
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,000
Hello.

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Sis, why couldn't I get through to you on the phone?

73
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,300
Where are you?

74
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,700
Brother, don't be mad.

75
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,800
I-I just moved to a cheaper hotel.

76
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,900
Where are you?

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm coming to get you.

78
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,600
It is… Give me a second.

79
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,100
It is Tianlin Village.

80
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Brother, hold on.

81
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,100
Sis.

82
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,600
 Sis. 

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,500
 Sis. 

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,500
 Sis! 

85
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,350
   

86
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,700
Hello, Old Gao. What happened?

87
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,000
 Where are you? 

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,800
 Something happened. 

89
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
Xun, what are you going to do?

90
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Zhu Yun, we are talking to you.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why do you turn a deaf ear to us?

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Where are you going?

93
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
Get out of your stupor and go after her.

94
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,600
We've no idea where she's going in the middle of the night. Go!

95
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,300
Yun Yun!

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,500
 Zhu Yun, Li Lan was in a car accident. 

97
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,900
   

98
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,200
That bastard Fang Zhijing said that Li Lan asked him where there was a cheap hotel

99
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,600
so he kindly introduced one to her.

100
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,900
I think...

101
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,700
I think he was just afraid you'd get in his way in the finals.

102
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,100
so he tricked Li Lan out of there to scare you.

103
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,500
This guy ran away after recording his statement early in the morning.

104
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
Knowing that it was him who caused it, but there is nothing you can do about it.

105
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So useless!

106
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,700
Is there a possibility that he won't come back in the finals?

107
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
Gao, stop talking.

108
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,300
Dagang, that was an accident.

109
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,800
Your wife can't be brought back to life.

110
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,900
You still have a long way to go.

111
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,300
Dagang.

112
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,600
She was fine.

113
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
You insisted on her having the surgery.

114
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,100
Why did you ask her to have surgery?

115
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,400
Dagang. Dagang, calm down.

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
- Calm down. 
 - Let go of me.

117
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,100
- Let go of me. 
 - Get over here.

118
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,900
- Calm down. 
 - Let go of me.

119
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,200
What are you doing?

120
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,300
- Let go of me. 
 - Calm down.

121
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,400
Li Lan's family, please take her ashes.

122
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,400
   

123
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,800
   

124
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,200
♫  The laughter reminds me of my flowers  ♫

125
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,400
♫  Quietly blooming for me  ♫

126
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Did you know?

127
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,900
♫  I thought I would always be by their side  ♫

128
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,500
She liked the songs of Pu Shu best...

129
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,900
♫  But today we have left in a sea of people  ♫

130
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
...especially the one called "Those Flowers".

131
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
♫  Where are they?  ♫

132
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,100
The old recorder at home was broken...

133
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,200
and couldn't play the tape.

134
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,500
I didn't like it.

135
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,400
It was noisy.

136
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
So I threw it away.

137
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,100
♫  Is she still driving?  ♫

138
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,000
I told her that when we grew up...

139
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,800
and got rich, we would go to live concerts.

140
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,400
♫  They have been blown away by the wind  ♫

141
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,300
♫  And scattered toward the horizon  ♫

142
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,400
♫  Some stories haven't been finished  ♫

143
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,500
♫  But forget it  ♫

144
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,900
♫  It's hard to tell those feelings  ♫

145
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,500
 Sis, 

146
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,900
 here you are. 

147
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,200
 For me? 

148
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
 I'm going to bed. 

149
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:12,800
♫  Luckily, I had seen you throughout four seasons  ♫

150
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,900
♫  I think they're getting old  ♫

151
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,500
♫  Where are they  ♫

152
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,400
♫  We just went our separate ways  ♫

153
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
 That's just the way he is. 

154
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
 He keeps everything in his heart, but he pretends not to. 

155
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,200
 He cares, but he acts like he doesn't. 

156
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,100
♫  Lalala, I miss them  ♫

157
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,300
♫  Lalalala, lalalala  ♫

158
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,500
♫  Are they blooming?  ♫

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Li Xun, the police investigated it.

160
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,700
The driver of the truck also pleaded guilty.

161
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,500
Fang Zhijing deserves to die,

162
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
but the law doesn't hold him accountable.

163
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 With my dad gone, 

164
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,500
 I had to take care of my mom and my sister, 

165
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,900
 but I couldn't do it. 

166
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,700
 It is our destiny after all. 

167
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,800
 We have to accept it. 

168
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,600
♫  And scattered toward the horizon  ♫

169
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,700
♫  I think they're getting old  ♫

170
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,100
You can't just give up because of an accident.

171
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,300
You still have me.

172
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,940
♫  We just went our separate ways  ♫

173
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,700
It's snowing.

174
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,600
Look.

175
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,800
It's melting.

176
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,200
This is unscientific.

177
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I am cold-blooded.

178
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,300
Because you're taller than me.

179
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,000
Princess, do you have a dream?

180
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,100
My dream is to marry my first love.

181
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,400
Then I don't have to ask who that is.

182
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
Will my dream easily come true?

183
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,900
What are you going to do with me if I ever go wrong?

184
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Death by a thousand cuts and you'll go to hell.

185
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,600
Forget about it.

186
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,200
Li Xun.

187
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Well, remember, you said it yourself.

188
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
Betrayers shall go to hell.

189
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,800
 I never expected that the weight of a casual sentence would become so heavy. 

190
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,500
 Maybe I didn't get what Li Xun meant. 

191
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,200
 I thought that moment was the beginning of our happiness, 

192
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,000
 but I didn't expect it was the end of everything. 

193
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,770
   

194
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, we can ensure that the system error rate is less than one percent.

195
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,800
Yeah, Jiahe Hospital is using our system now.

196
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,900
Okay, so let me show you.

197
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,700
See you later.

198
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,600
Li Xun, I have to go.

199
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Go ahead.

200
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,800
Zhu Yun.

201
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
I have something to tell you.

202
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,500
I'd like to transfer your shares to me first.

203
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,200
Okay.

204
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,800
You won't ask why?

205
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,000
Do I need to ask?

206
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Go.

207
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm leaving.

208
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,870
   

209
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,590
I went back to the office and didn't find you.

210
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,100
What are you doing here?

211
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Why do you suddenly want to fix it?

212
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,300
Didn't you say that if the chair didn't rattle, you wouldn't be able to type code in rhythm?

213
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,910
Did your mom call you again?

214
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,150
She called many times.

215
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,880
Take me to your parents.

216
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,830
It's just a matter of time.

217
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,140
I can't keep avoiding them.

218
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,280
Don't you believe me?

219
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,780
Of course not.

220
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,100
It's just that my mom…

221
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,810
I know.

222
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,940
Your parents have a problem with me.

223
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,250
There's a good chance they'll embarrass me when I meet them.

224
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,850
It's okay. I have to handle them.

225
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,420
I don't want you to be caught in the middle anymore.

226
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,290
Forget it.

227
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,990
Take your time.

228
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,480
It's been a really special time.

229
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,300
I'm sure they're worried about your future plans.

230
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,040
No matter what we're going to do, I have to say something. Right?

231
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,710
Otherwise, we don't look serious.

232
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,580
Li Lan is gone.

233
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,560
You're all I have.

234
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,770
Gao.

235
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,620
What brings you here?

236
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,860
Can't I come to see you?

237
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,190
This is the legendary base.

238
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,740
What's going on?

239
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,710
Are you moving?

240
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,450
We are about to graduate.

241
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,040
The base has been dissolved.

242
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,210
Are you really here for me,

243
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,640
or are you just here for another information contest?

244
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm here for Li Xun.

245
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,280
He said you guys were starting a business.

246
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,940
That's Zhu Yun and Li Xun's company.

247
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,440
I'll find a way out on my own.

248
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,730
So where are you going?

249
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,580
Don't bother yourself with me.

250
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,490
What do you want with Li Xun?

251
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,070
He invited me here.

252
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,850
Did he?

253
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,800
Yes, I did.

254
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,310
Old Gao, give me a second.

255
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,560
I need to talk to you later.

256
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,210
Let's go. Let's talk outside.

257
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,420
Stir-fry some broccoli.

258
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,020
 What's going on? Don't be late today. 

259
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,560
Hello. Are you here? I'll come out to pick you up.

260
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,040
 Zhu Yun. 

261
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,050
 Isn't Li Xun going to meet your parents at your home today? 

262
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,500
Miaomiao.

263
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,970
Yeah, I got an appointment with him.

264
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,990
Did he go?

265
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,490
What happened?

266
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,150
I saw him with Xu Lina.

267
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,890
I didn't even have to pick you up. You know the way.

268
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,970
After all, you've been here.

269
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,040
Don't change your shoes. Go straight in.

270
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,350
Li Xun.

271
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,920
Li is coming.

272
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,830
Hello, Uncle.

273
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,080
I got something for you.

274
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,280
Thank you. Give it to me. Come on.

275
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,210
It will take a while for the meal to be ready.

276
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,490
Well, follow me to the study.

277
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,210
Let's have tea and chat.

278
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,720
Here.

279
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,070
I heard about you from Yun's mom.

280
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,200
No big deal.

281
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,720
It's normal for young people to make mistakes.

282
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,090
I don't mind as long as you're not intrinsically bad.

283
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,390
Li,

284
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,350
you're a wise man, so I'm going to...

285
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,790
give it to you straight. Okay?

286
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:31,800
If the two of us are partners, friends,

287
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,340
and even relatives,

288
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,040
but Yun Yun is our only daughter.

289
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,720
If you two are together without her mom's approval,

290
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,590
you won't be happy,

291
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,590
and our family won't be happy.

292
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,970
Do you get me?

293
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,530
Yes.

294
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,650
Yun Yun, come and clear the table.

295
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,850
I've been writing apps all morning and I'm starving.

296
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:34,720
Haven't you figured out what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do?

297
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,410
I have already registered you for the post-graduate entrance examination.

298
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,120
Work hard. You won't get a second chance.

299
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,210
I told you I don't want to go abroad.

300
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,150
In addition to being Li Xun's girlfriend, I am also a partner in the new company.

301
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,100
Now that the company is on the right track, I definitely can't leave.

302
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,280
Like it or not, I've made my decision, and it's not going to change.

303
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,410
You are young.

304
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,900
Don't say anything absolute so easily.

305
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,200
In a few years you will know how naive you are today.

306
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,880
We always wanted to send Yun abroad,

307
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,240
but she is now determined to stay in China to start a business with you.

308
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,700
And with what happened to your family, she can't leave you alone.

309
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,950
This really puts me in a bind.

310
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,040
Li,

311
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,950
I do have a suggestion for you.

312
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,090
If you two really want to be together,

313
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:54,070
why don't you go abroad together

314
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,350
and change your environment?

315
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,020
Of course, I'll cover all the expenses.

316
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,840
So you can accept me?

317
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,450
We still need time.

318
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,010
But the most important thing is that...

319
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,810
you two need time, too.

320
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:37,140
Whether you can get married really needs the test of time.

321
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,170
I know this sounds abrupt and selfish.

322
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,660
You're just starting out after all.

323
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,270
I checked it out.

324
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,620
Your company is quite promising.

325
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,920
But I'm telling you there's no room for trial and error in our current society.

326
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,330
One wrong step leads to another.

327
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,060
Yun is my only daughter.

328
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,110
There's no way I'm going to let her try it out.

329
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,090
Did I make myself clear?

330
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:31,110
So if you really care about Yun and really want to be with her,

331
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,130
you should consider it.

332
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,250
My wife knew you were coming, so she cooked herself.

333
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
Here. Take a seat.

334
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,160
Let me sit inside.

335
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,550
Come on. Enjoy yourself.

336
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,910
Let's talk while eating.

337
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,090
Enjoy yourself.

338
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,150
Yeah, enjoy it.

339
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,480
You cook better than I do.

340
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,930
What exactly does your company do?

341
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,390
Mom.

342
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,090
Didn't you say you wanted me to know more?

343
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,040
We're building a medical system.

344
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,840
With the both of you... can it be done?

345
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,890
The shrimp is fresh.

346
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,550
Eat while it is hot.

347
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,820
Uncle Zhu. Aunt Liu. Thank you for inviting me to your home.

348
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,760
I propose a toast to you.

349
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,290
Uncle told me a lot just now.

350
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,390
I know what you're trying to do.

351
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,500
But I also want to say that...

352
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,550
Zhu Yun and I will be happy together.

353
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,340
So by choosing to start a business,

354
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,120
she also chose to believe in our future.

355
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,380
Please rest assured,

356
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,870
and please believe Zhu Yun's own choice.

357
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,390
Why are you so stubborn?

358
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,900
I'm stubborn just because I don't want to go abroad.

359
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,720
Li Xun.

360
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,450
Li, it's improper for you to say that.

361
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,450
What did I tell you about in the study?

362
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,670
It's hard for young people to start a business these days.

363
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,940
You can't just do whatever you want.

364
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,450
We agreed to let you go abroad together after careful consideration.

365
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,870
That's our bottom line.

366
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,240
We've been very considerate of your feelings.

367
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,360
At the end of the day, we just want to protect Yun.

368
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,990
If you insist…

369
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,650
If you insist, you are embarrassing Zhu Yun and putting her in a dilemma.

370
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,340
Then I'm going to question what you are up to.

371
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,600
You're talking about going abroad, huh?

372
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,260
Dad. Mom. I really don't want to go abroad.

373
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,870
Our company has recently closed a deal with many investors.

374
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,680
It's incredible to do that from a start.

375
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,940
We're serious.

376
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,160
Aunt, I know you have a problem with me.

377
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,400
It doesn't matter.

378
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:41,160
Since you know me, you should know what I can do.

379
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,330
If you are willing to help me…

380
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,220
Help?

381
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,020
Okay. So what kind of help do you need?

382
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,980
Zhu Yun and I just started our business.

383
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,860
Doing business requires connections.

384
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,800
Isn't your company specializing in medical equipment for rehabilitation?

385
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,860
With my skills, and your strength and connections,

386
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,650
we can work together for win-win results.

387
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,670
You help me expand my business nationwide.

388
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,950
When the company goes public,

389
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,370
as we're a family,

390
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,860
we can all benefit from it.

391
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,090
What are you talking about, Li Xun?

392
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,970
What's your opinion?

393
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,670
Great, young man.

394
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,520
You know all about our family.

395
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,350
Let me ask you... Are you here today to solicit sponsorship?

396
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:07,850
Li Xun, did you always know that Zhu Yun was my daughter?

397
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,820
I see you're really holding it against me.

398
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,880
Zhu Yun, do you remember what I told you?

399
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,850
He pursued you on purpose.

400
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,790
You just didn't believe it before.

401
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,120
You saw that today.

402
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,640
If he hadn't been after our family, he wouldn't have been haunting you.

403
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,920
- That's not true, Mom. 
 - All right, there's no room for discussion.

404
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,460
We're not going to agree to your relationship.

405
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,770
Zhu Yun will live a better life with me. You'll find out later.

406
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,490
No need, Yun is doing very well now.

407
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,770
Honestly, you're dragging her down.

408
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,920
- Dad. 
 - Yun Yun, you see it now.

409
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,620
See? I told you it's hard to change who someone is.

410
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,290
Don't think that you're great just because you got a good score in the college entrance examination.

411
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,270
The first place in the college entrance examination can't change his greedy, selfish, and meticulous nature.

412
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,270
Mom, would you please stop talking about it?

413
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,140
Yun Yun, enough.

414
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,250
Who is he to you now?

415
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,330
You're so protective of him.

416
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:20,020
Li Xun, go.

417
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,600
You're not welcome here.

418
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,970
Dad.

419
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,450
I thought you would take a longer view.

420
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,550
How shortsighted.

421
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,500
Li Xun.

422
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,800
See, Zhu Yun?

423
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,770
How can we possibly allow you to be with someone like him?

424
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,950
I'm telling you something's going to happen to him sooner or later.

425
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,550
- Yun Yun. 
 - What are you doing?

426
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,720
What are you doing? Get back!

427
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,340
Zhu Yun!

428
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:13,940


429
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,900
   

430
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,840
 Why is she here? 

431
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,590
 Why can't I be here? There's no mistake. 

432
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:33,040
 Li Xun, if you take one more step today, it'll be over between us. 

433
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,340
 Old Gao, I have no family, no friends, 

434
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,230
 but there are things 

435
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,750
 I have to do. 

436
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,330
 Li Xun. 

437
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:50,110
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

438
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,170
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

439
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:00,670
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

440
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:06,490
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

441

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:18,010
♫  We will not separate  ♫

443

♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

444
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,570
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

445
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,510
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

446
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:37,670
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

447
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,350
