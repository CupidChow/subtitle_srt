1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:16,000


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,695
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,690
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,340
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,580
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,920
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,880
   

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,770
   

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,546
   

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,225
   

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,300
    
 Go!

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,970
Go!

26
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,206
It's really not bad.

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,880
   

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,318
Great. Great. Great.

29
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,410
We're making history. We're making history, right?

30
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,160
We jumped to third place at just 11:00.

31
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,780
We have the chance to get the largest number of downloads.

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,197
- We will make it. 
 - We will.

33
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:53,340
The number of registered users is increasing.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,950
There are almost 50,000 users.

35
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,750
They increased to 50,000 so soon.

36
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,460
Look. And the game is well received.

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,230
The score is 8.9 now.

38
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,671
    
 It'll be 9.0 soon.

39
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,500
Read this comment.

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,750
The player said this is the most serious history game he has played.

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,160
Recharged.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,810
    
 Someone recharged.

43
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,970
    
 Since the establishment of the company,

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,320
- someone recharged. 
 - Recharged!

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,470
We've been paid. Oh my god.

46
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,600
It's too hard-won.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,950
- How much? 
 - 10 yuan.

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,620
That's such a tiny amount.

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,120
It is not enough for a meal of spicy hotpot.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,080
But it's our first income after all.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,110
Never mind. Anyway, we made money.

52
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,969
- Yes. 
 - Right.

53
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,750
I'd like to say something.

54
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,450
Go ahead.

55
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,780
- Well done. 
 - Great!

56
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,300
Great!

57
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,538
The greatest contributor is our Iron Lady.

58
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,950
- Say something. 
 - Right.

59
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,000
Right. Say something.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,020
I don't know what to say.

61
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,320
I don't know.

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,090
Say something. Say something.

63
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,000
- Say something. 
 - Say something.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,910
Thanks to Zhao Teng and Xiaojian for changing the code and drawing posters overnight.

65
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,300
I'll always buy hair-generating shampoo for you.

66
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,650
Okay. Great.

67
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,566
Who gave you the job in this company?

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,450
Thanks to Zhang Fang for buying steamed stuffed buns for us every day.

69
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,890
He has provided us with firm support.

70
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,040
I contributed to your success?

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,840
Yes. Yes. Yes.

72
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,100
And?

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
Li Xun,

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,732
thanks for your hard work.

75
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,996
I'm paid for that.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,900
That's all?

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,330
You always stayed with each other when working overtime.

78
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,660
What's wrong with you now?

79
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,250
Are you afraid?

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,381
Come on. Do what you should!

81
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:13,761
Yes. You two like voting 2 to 1, right? Come on.

82
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,770
Come on. Come on. Come on.

83
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,280
What? What's going on?

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,250
- It's between the young ones. 
 - Yes.

85
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,691
Come on. I'll give you a material benefit.

86
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,250
We're waiting for that.

87
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,010
After all, we got our first income. Right?

88
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,656
We must spend it.

89
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:31,810
Let's drink.

90
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,210
Drink.

91
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,038
You arrange it.

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,986
Be sure to arrange it.

93
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:41,710
Go!

94
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,793
I'll arrange it.

95
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,030
- It's still rising. 
 - Right. Right. Right.

96
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,890
Give me an infinite life.

97
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,821
Come on. Ice bars are here.

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Fang, you're generous today. Boss, here is a Magnum for you.

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,599
The exciting moment.

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,180
I paid for these with the company's money, but that one with my money.

101
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,250
That's how we should deal with each other in the office.

102
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,750
Thanks.

103
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,370
There was no need to give and take.

104
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,330
After all, they're just saltwater ice bars.

105
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,790
Be humble for a while and it will be salt water.

106
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:38,570
Though we put an end to office romance, but you two are as frozen as popsicles right now.

107
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,550
How will you work together?

108
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,910
Might as well let it go. It's no big deal, our management will turn a blind eye in the future.

109
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,740
Why are you more stiff?

110
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,126
By the way,

111
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:06,550
shall we take a group photo to commemorate this historic moment?

112
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,230
Take a photo with my phone.

113
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,860
Well, take a photo with it.

114
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,280
Well, hurry up.

115
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,666
1, 2, 3.

116
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,030
I have been busy with my work recently. My wife is annoying.

117
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,311
Look!  She is calling me.

118
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,498
Hello, Dear.

119
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,590
I'll finish soon.

120
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,060
Don't worry.

121
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,170
I see. Sleep earlier.

122
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,246
I'll be home soon.

123
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,180
Okay.

124
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,566
She checks up on me all the time.

125
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,194
She does it every day. I have no choice.

126
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:55,984
You make us jealous.

127
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,218
 

128
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,260
Good morning.

129
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,420
Why did you get up so early?

130
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,230
Are you sober?

131
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,880
I came back late last night.

132
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,066
Did I disturb you?

133
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,540
You come back late every day.

134
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,581
I've gotten used to it.

135
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,538
I made porridge for you.

136
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,280
Thanks.

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,970
Don't just drink milk.

138
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,300
Come here and eat an egg.

139
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,067
Our company's new game is coming.

140
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,124
Rivalry Among Seven Powers.

141
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,160
You didn't mention it before.

142
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,692
You can be the game ambassador.

143
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,610
I haven't felt good recently.

144
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,754
I want to rest for a while.

145
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,930
What's wrong?

146
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,294
Nothing.

147
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,240
I feel tired.

148
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:57,352
Actually, I wonder what else I can do besides game ambassador.

149
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,940
What is Rivalry Among Seven Powers you just mentioned like?

150
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:13,919
Do you want to know if it's similar to Li Xun's Invincible General?

151
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,660
I can tell you.

152
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,540
Yes. They're identical.

153
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,540
I know you want to fight with Li Xun.

154
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,130
But what's the point of making an identical game?

155
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:32,040
I just want to beat him so that he can't turn over.

156
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,730
I want to let him know that the current game market is L &amp; P's.

157
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,634
Whatever you say, I won't be the game ambassador.

158
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,970
You've been tired recently.

159
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,596
Eat this egg to supplement protein.

160
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,710
I have had no appetite in the morning.

161
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,201
Thanks. You eat it.

162
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:57,847
I'll take a bath.

163
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,600
Sit down.

164
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,960
Sit down.

165
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,940
Eat this egg.

166
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,722
You won't get fat.

167
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,532
Let me feed you.

168
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,760
Eat slowly.

169
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
Good girl.

170
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,960
It's for your own good.

171
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,810
Come on.

172
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,581
Are you ready? Well. 1, 2, 3. Throw.

173
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,265
Well, change your expression.

174
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,900
Throw.

175
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,052
Lina, let me help you with your dress.

176
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,060
Okay. What do you think?

177
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,420
Okay. Thanks.

178
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,120
Your welcome.

179
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,250
Cappuccino.

180
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,900
No sugar.

181
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,110
Lina, thank you for your hard work.

182
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,834
You're beautiful.

183
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,240
Old Gao, I want to study abroad as a graduate student.

184
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:48,104
Why do you mention it suddenly?

185
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,420
No reason.

186
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,140
You know that I want to study abroad.

187
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,640
Moreover, many of my friends are abroad.

188
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,690
I haven't had a chance to go abroad.

189
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,122
I want to make up for past regrets.

190
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,260
I support you.

191
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,188
I really support you.

192
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:09,610
I'll go with you when I retire in a few years.

193
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,610
We'll try to have a baby.

194
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,718
A few years is a long time.

195
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,052
How about going abroad when you finish Rivalry Among Seven Powers?

196
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,550
You can't leave now.

197
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,012
The company needs you.

198
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,730
Director Zhang, did we make a reservation for today?

199
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,440
I just put the money where it matters most as I often say.

200
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,379
How can we be decent today without my usual penny-pinching?

201
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:11,160
To attract more users offline, I showed my hand.

202
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,480
Great, Zhang Fang.

203
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,960
You're willing to spend money.

204
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,010
- Attract more users. 
 - What's wrong?

205
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,330
Zhang Fang, the name is wrong.

206
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,410
Yes. You got the wrong name. Come on. Be more reliable.

207
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,778
No. No.

208
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:35,002
   

209
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:36,745
L&amp;P.

210
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,830
Ours is over there.

211
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,040
 Hello, online players. 

212
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,640
 Welcome to Rivalry Among Seven Powers. 

213
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,790
 I'm your host Tiantian. Nice to meet you. 

214
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,400
 - Today I'd like to introduce...  
 - What the hell!

215
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,150
 ...A war simulation game, Rivalry among Seven Powers. 

216
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,630
 I believe that many of you here are fans of the game. 

217
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,760
 Designed by our ace planning team for two years, 

218
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,200
 the game, with the setting of seven powers, 

219
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,150
 features the game experience of how players survive in troubled times 

220
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,110
 and finally conquer the other six kingdoms using their own strategies. 

221
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,670
   

222
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,290
Ace planning team?

223
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,970
Two years?

224
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,900
They're so shameless.

225
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,680
The characters, engines, game play,

226
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,380
and skins of Rivalry Among Seven Powers.

227
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,080
They're identical to those of Invincible General.

228
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,970
It may be wrongly taken as our side story. How shameless!

229
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,480
Obviously, they copied our game.

230
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,530
Can-Can we sue them?

231
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,530
Sue? Come on.

232
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,060
Speaking of that, I remember it's not the first time they've done this.

233
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,580
L&amp;P has a famous law team.

234
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,780
I guess that's what they do. No one can win a case against them.

235
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,010
They're really shameless.

236
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,580
- Have you got action figures? 
 - Action figures?

237
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,806
They're in the box.

238
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,910
They are really rough.

239
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,620
They were nice to make these for us.

240
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
Put them up.

241
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,900
Where is Group Leader Zhu?

242
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,886
She is on her way.

243
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,900
Call and tell her not to come here.

244
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,400
Why?

245
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,110
Even you want to sue them,

246
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,970
what do you think she'll do?

247
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,651
 Question 1. Which state conquered the other six states? 

248
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,601
- Sir. Sir. 
 - I want to meet your person in charge.

249
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,950
I have nothing to say to you.

250
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,210
Where is Zhang Fang?

251
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,240
- Zhang... 
 - Sorry.

252
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,740
Sorry, sir.

253
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,569
He is over there.

254
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,120
Sir!

255
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,580
Why must you drive us away?

256
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,180
We paid for the booth.

257
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,450
Stop, Xiaojian. Collect our stuff.

258
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,651
No. He didn't mean to.

259
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,412
Stop.

260
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,900
Fang, I know you didn't mean to.

261
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,625
You're the best.

262
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,642
This is delicate.

263
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,490
Big ones break easily.

264
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,290
Small ones are strong.

265
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,970
I agree.

266
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,190
But I wonder how long it will last in a fire.

267
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,115
Have a try.

268
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,450
I thought Invincible General was a masterpiece.

269
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,730
After playing it, I found you set force values for generals.

270
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,960
Those with a high value fight faster while those with a lower value fight slower.

271
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,900
Nobody wants to play such a boring game.

272
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,420
Cut the crap.

273
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,970
We have nearly 50 characters and over 200 weapons.

274
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,620
The gameplay and strategy chosen are what matter most.

275
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,490
I just played your game.

276
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,820
It's labeled as an education simulation game.

277
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,480
But I think you just set more skins and props.

278
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,250
You're trying to let players spend more money.

279
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,951
- You're shameless. 
 - You're shameless.

280
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,420
Li Xun, is it meaningful for you to waste your time and work with these fools?

281
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,140
In this case, why did you copy our game?

282
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,390
Even so, ours is better than yours.

283
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,690
You plagiarize the ideas of your peers and cheat users.

284
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,940
You're shameless.

285
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,260
You know what?  We'll continue the publication and promotion of our great game.

286
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,340
We'll keep doing monthly updates.

287
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,840
Yes.

288
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,380
Then good luck.

289
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,490
I hope Invincible General is still remembered when it's updated next time.

290
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,200
Look at his sheepish look.

291
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,620
 Look, this cat is cute. 

292
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,273
 Yes. 

293
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
Li Xun, go and buy some scallions.

294
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,300
I have no time.

295
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,652
It won't take you long.

296
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,860
Okay.

297
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,460
Damn.

298
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,650
You're still playing the game.

299
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,284
Old Gao is insidious.

300
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:56,490
Fine.

301
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,064
It'll be interesting when they update the game tomorrow.

302
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,642
Well, leave it to me.

303
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,340
They implanted a virus.

304
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,611
Now we're trying to kill them and trace the source.

305
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,688
Another one.

306
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,255
It's Li Xun.

307
00:24:01,255 --> 00:24:02,820
How do you know?

308
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,340
He hides the IPA, but I know well how he attacks.

309
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,450
I'll help Dongliang.

310
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,950
Wait.

311
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,940
Just leave it.

312
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,347
You're going to...

313
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,220
How many years will he be sentenced for hacking into a computer system?

314
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,606
It'll be great if Li Xun is convicted.

315
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,500
Right?

316
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,317
So you're going to...

317
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,135
I'll send him back to prison.

318
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,460
The price is a bit higher. The scallions costs me 2 yuan.

319
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,253
Do you know what you did?

320
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,490
It was just a piece of cake.

321
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,090
Really?

322
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,040
You directly implanted viruses into the server of Rivalry Among Seven Powers.

323
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,580
Do you think the experts of L&amp;P can't find out who you are?

324
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,730
They can try. At 8:00 tomorrow morning, I'll disable their server.

325
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,660
Don't even think about being able to recover within 10 days to a month.

326
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,490
I told you not to act without my permission.

327
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,900
Come on. What are you afraid of?

328
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,180
Not to mention whether they can find me, what if they can find me?

329
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,290
Hou Ning, no one will stop you if you want to be imprisoned again.

330
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,478
Move out of here now.

331
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,520
I can't bear seeing what they have done to you.

332
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,450
I don't need your help.

333
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,246
Why are you shouting at me?

334
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,000
Come on. I can't understand.

335
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,410
We're both capable. Why do you have to hide in this shitty place?

336
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,200
I'm cheap.

337
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,640
I must be cheap. I rushed to stay with you in this shitty place to cook shitty meals for you.

338
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,930
I deserve to live like a street mouse.

339
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,840
If you insist on humiliating yourself, no one can stop you.

340
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,881
Who abuses himself?

341
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,340
- Who? 
  - Policemen. 

342
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,150
 We're from the Network Security Team of the Municipal Bureau. 

343
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,150
Li Xun, don't stop me. I don't want to be imprisoned again.

344
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,631
Calm down.

345
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,330
Hou Ning, trust me.

346
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,020
I won't let you be imprisoned again.

347
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,144
Li Xun and Hou Ning, right?

348
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:38,590
You were reported to have hacked the server of L&amp;P.

349
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,500
Please go with us and co-operate with the investigation.

350
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,950
 He was released from prison not long ago. 

351
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,240
 Did he do something wrong? 

352
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,530
 He came here not long ago. He seemed pretty nice. 

353
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,526
 A leopard will never change its spots. 

354
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,550
Li Xun really cleared the virus.

355
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,232
Never mind.

356
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,572
We suffer no losses,

357
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:02,227
but we can create losses.

358
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,150
You mean you cleared the virus they implanted, right?

359
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,650
Yes.

360
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,029
Sir, we've caused no loss to L&amp;P.

361
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,080
I think this is a misunderstanding.

362
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,690
No loss. I don't think so.

363
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,380
Li Xun, you're so cruel.

364
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,590
Though the virus are cleared, you deleted the core user data

365
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,820
of Rivalry Among Seven Powers, which is most valuable to our company.

366
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,620
You can't compete fairly, so you began to play dirty.

367
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,050
You're trying to destroy Rivalry Among Seven Powers.

368
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,140
Gao Jianhong, you're slinging mud at us. I did nothing to your user data.

369
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,400
Sir, this is the data called by our company's security department.

370
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,080
We have sufficient evidence to prove that Li Xun deleted the core data assets

371
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,560
of our company's most important game, Rivalry Among Seven Powers,

372
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,060
while removing the virus.

373
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,800
Lawyer Wang.

374
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,100
According to Article 285 of the Criminal Law of the PRC,

375
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,870
whoever, in violation of state regulations, hacks a computer information system,

376
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,660
other than those specified in the preceding paragraph,

377
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,820
or uses other technical means to obtain storage,

378
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,580
processing and transmission data in the computer information system,

379
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,210
or exercises illegal control over the computer information system,

380
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,840
if the consequences are serious,

381
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,680
shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention;

382
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,860
if the consequences are especially serious,

383
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,580
shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than seven years

384
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,548
and imposed a fine.

385
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,050
You played these dirty tricks.

386
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,860
You can't escape from the long arm of the law.

387
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,914
You will be imprisoned.

388
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,880
Is there anything else you want to say?

389
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,649
Admit it.

390
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:25,378
When you are released a few years later, you'll still be a hero.

391
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,608
I'll be waiting for you.

392
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,026
Someone is here to help.

393
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:02,636
I have nothing to say, but she does.

394
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,860
There is a saying in the hacker circle.

395
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,204
Everything has its trace.

396
00:30:14,204 --> 00:30:18,442
Whoever has entered your server will leave traces.

397
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,490
Zhu Yun, what are you doing?

398
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,695
Someone invaded your server through Port 1433.

399
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:39,376
- Someone? You mean Li Xun. Right? 
 - Really?

400
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:42,774
Sir, Port 1433 is a SQL Server.

401
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:47,590
This port provides external services.SQL Server's TCP is used for relational database management systems.

402
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:53,870
Li Xun and Hou Ning invaded our server through this port successively.

403
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,430
Right. After Li Xun entered your server

404
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,760
and cleared the virus Hou Ning implanted,

405
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,670
you disabled Port 1433 externally and have not restored it until now.

406
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:07,320
Yes. We found an invader, so we closed Port 1433 externally.

407
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,600
But before that, Li Xun had deleted some of our important core user data.

408
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,330
But according to the server log file I retrieved,

409
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,620
Port 1433 was disabled at 3:17 p.m.,

410
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,490
while the core user data was deleted at 4:21 p.m.

411
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:34,200
How did Li Xun break through port 1433 to enter the server and delete core user data when port 1433 was disabled?

412
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,241
Now that they can invade our server,

413
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,430
certainly they can also modify our log files.

414
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,574
That doesn't mean anything.

415
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,750
Mr. Gao, you have confidence in our ability.

416
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,730
It seems that we have to make Mr. Gao a coffin,

417
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:12,086
or he won't shed a tear when he sees the coffin.

418
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,413
Mr. Policeman,

419
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,620
when a port is disabled externally,

420
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,280
no one can use this port to invade a computer

421
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,860
with an external network, unless...

422
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,640
Unless? Unless what?

423
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,550
Unless someone enters the same port from the intranet.

424
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,043
This is the IPA.

425
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,607
Mr. Policeman,

426
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,100
you'll find the user of this IPA in the R&amp;D Department of L&amp;P.

427
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,840
He is the one who invaded the server of L&amp;P through the internet

428
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,700
and deleted the core user data.

429
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,796
Sir, otherwise,

430
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:13,340
I'll ask the technical personnel of L&amp;P to check it again now.

431
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,420
- We... 
 - No need.

432
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,050
We'll check ourselves later

433
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,250
to punish employees who violate the company's regulations

434
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,422
severely and never relent.

435
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,336
Mr. Gao is really sensible.

436
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,040
By the way, sir,

437
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,140
Zhu Yun just entered our company's internet in front of you

438
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,290
and called our server logs.

439
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,676
She was breaking the law

440
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:55,950
and shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention.

441
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,580
Is there any problem with my access to the intranet of Flying?

442
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,846
Your intranet?

443
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,260
This IPA is on a desktop computer of Flying Network.

444
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,970
Just now I made a demonstration using the intranet of Flying Company.

445
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,510
What you saw was an experiment.

446
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,420
Also, I estimated the log time.

447
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,940
Though Invincible General appears insignificant when compared with

448
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Rivalry Among Seven Powers, but game servers work similarly.

449
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,414
Mr. Gao, you didn't see it.

450
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,620
Would you like to check again?

451
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,790
No need.

452
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,590
   

453
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,320
   

454
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,910
Well, are you all right?

455
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,190
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

456
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,520
I warned you not to try to fight with him.

457
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,740
You know what? If you caused losses to L&amp;P, you'd have been imprisoned

458
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,911
for a few years again.

459
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,881
- I wanted to help him. 
 - You're hurting him.

460
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,340
No, what right do you have to criticize me?

461
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,990
- If it wasn't for you, would he go in? 
 - Enough.

462
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,090
It has nothing to do with her.

463
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,050
What do you mean it doesn't?

464
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,920
- Isn't it because of her that you went in? 
 - Shut up.

465
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,010
Let's go!

466
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,180
You've gone too far!

467
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,740
Hou Ning. Come back, Hou Ning.

468
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,820
- Come back. 
 - Let go.

469
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,070
Come back.

470
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,670
Let go!

471
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,580
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yes. I'm crazy.

472
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,360
Li Xun,

473
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,790
I'm crazy, so I live here with you.

474
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,400
Look around. Look at those around you.

475
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,909
Is any one of them normal?

476
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,000
The college classmate who you got along with day and night can't wait for you to bury you in the ground.

477
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,900
And this one does nothing all day long.

478
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,510
He encourages you to be with her, like a pervert.

479
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,110
- Who is perverted? 
 - Shut up.

480
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,650
And she is like the bane of your life.

481
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,820
She is dating the painter.

482
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,394
Can't you see?

483
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:56,920
Tell me. Who else is there that you miss?

484
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,069
All of you are my precious memories,

485
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,490
including you.

486
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,372
Bullshit.

487
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,689
Am I really important to you?

488
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,614
Listen, you'll come to me.

489
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:33,695
You'll regret.

490
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,650
- Hou Ning! 
 - Let him go.

491
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,960
   

492
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,450
Drink some hot water, or you may catch a cold.

493
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,920
Thanks.

494
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,405
You may catch a cold.

495
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,320
Drink it.

496
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Thanks.

497
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,150
Change into it.

498
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,510
Change your clothes, or you'll catch a cold.

499
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,920
 Don't be afraid. Just change into it. 

500
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,984
Do you have extra pants?

501
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,151
Do my pants fit you?

502
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,168
I don't know. I haven't tried before.

503
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,832
Throw it over.

504
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,540
Okay?

505
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,012
Forget it. They are too large.

506
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,984
Do you want to try sheets?

507
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,020
Do you have a hair dryer?

508
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,050
No.

509
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:07,264
I have nothing you girls need.

510
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,650
Sleep here.

511
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,904
Where will you sleep?

512
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,080
We'll start to work in three hours.

513
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,825
Are you going home?

514
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,326
I'll sleep out there.

515
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,294
I'll take a coat.

516
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,690
Good night.

517
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,990
Good night.

518
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:45,250


519
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,700
   

520
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,450
 Why have they always gone against us? 

521
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,740
 It's because of us. 

522
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,240
 Li Xun, 

523
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,308
 have you ever thought about me? 

524
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,074
 What if I say no? 

525
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,928
 I don't believe it. 

526
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,262
 Is it impossible for us?? 

527
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,810
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

528
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,880
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

529
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,560
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

530
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,220
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

531
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,620
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

532
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:42,660
♫  We will not separate  ♫

533
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,780
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

534
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,320
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

535
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,260
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

536
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:02,590
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

537
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:10,100
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

538
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,460
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

539
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,720
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

540
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,340
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

541
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,800
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

542
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,260
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

543
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,820
♫  That hot firework  ♫

544
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:47,565
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

545
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,360
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

546
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,210
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

547
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:11,120
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

548
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,700
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

549
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,840
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

550
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,320
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

551
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,740
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

552
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,140
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

553
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:38,820
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

554
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,400
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

555
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,720
♫  True love will take its course ♫

♫  True love will take its course  ♫

560
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,860
♫  That hot firework  ♫

561
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:20,820
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫
