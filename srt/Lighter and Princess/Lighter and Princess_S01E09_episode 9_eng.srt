1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,800
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,660
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,720
   

22
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,350
You woke up?

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,780
- Where am I? 
 - My studio.

24
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,070
Your studio?

25
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,430
When you were sleeping last night, you almost strangled me too tightly to death.

26
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,490
Where is Li Xun?

27
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,850
You don't remember where you are but remember Li Xun.

28
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,530
 Last night... 

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,320
Oh, my god.

30
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,450
Where is he?

31
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,340
- He left early in the morning. 
 - He went back to the base?

32
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,800
He doesn't have to report this to me.

33
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,190
Your cellphone. It's running out. Charge it now.

34
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,060
No, thanks. I have to go.

35
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,070
They both ran away after waking up.

36
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,600
You woke up?

37
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,380
You drank quite a lot last night, too.

38
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,130
Why can you still sit down here and write programs?

39
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,560
I have different genes from yours.

40
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,140
We didn't finish the conversation last night.

41
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,460
Don't be entangled with it, okay?

42
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,810
Do make it clear.

43
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,650
What should I say?

44
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,220
No, you have to say something.

45
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,220
Come out with me.

46
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,630
Why didn't you say it early?

47
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,060
We have been working on this website for so long.

48
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,580
But it is worthless.

49
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,940
Have we been working hard for this in vain?

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,590
In vain?

51
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,220
After you finish the project, do you think you gain nothing at all?

52
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,370
No, I don't think so.

53
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,100
If I told you this website earned no money

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,370
and would also be replaced by others later on,

55
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,570
would you still work so hard on it?

56
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,060
- But... 
 - There are no buts.

57
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,310
This website has no problems and has a high degree of completion.

58
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,590
Whether it's profitable depends on a lot of factors.

59
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,940
Then you can tell us the truth. Let's do our best one together.

60
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,590
You believed what Han Jiakang said when drinking wine.

61
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,830
Do it directly?

62
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,620
Work for people and earn money for people.

63
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,740
Money, money, money.

64
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,410
You always mention money every day.

65
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,550
- In my opinion, you and Zhang Xiaobei... 
 - What did you say?

66
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,830
What did you say?

67
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,100
What?

68
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,040
Say it again.

69
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,130
Your Royal Highness,

70
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,230
you really don't know how expensive it is to manage a cause.

71
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,670
Do you know how much Ren Di's damned band costs in a month?

72
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,560
Tell me.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,510
Are computers of the base running fast?

74
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,580
Do you know what the configuration is that they have?

75
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,020
Have you ever thought about why in the school only the computers in this classroom run fast?

76
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,750
Does the school specifically pay for your equipment?

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,540
Why? Because you look good?

78
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,340
You think I look good?

79
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,880
Or maybe you saw something last night.

80
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,670
What are you laughing at?

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm pondering over something.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,500
What is it?

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,820
Inspirational words you told me.

84
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,170
"Zhu Yun,

85
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,770
at the very beginning, everything is the way it is.

86
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,140
The more you move towards it, the more it deviates.

87
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,240
But it is still worth our efforts.

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,930
We work hard just to keep it from going further."

89
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,840
Am I right?

90
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,080
You remember so well what I said.

91
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,720
Fine.

92
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,200
- What are you doing? 
 - None of your business.

93
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,950
 See you at Lishan Mountain for a meeting tomorrow morning. 

94
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,060
Li Xun is a nut.

95
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,140
Why does he ask us to come here for a meeting?

96
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,780
I don't know. Even so, he doesn't appear now.

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,650
 See you at the top of the mountain. 

98
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,050
"See you at the top of the mountain"?

99
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,240
- Slow down. 
 - Okay.

100
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,450
What a damned place Li Xun asks us to come to.

101
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,210
Right.

102
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,890
Have we arrived?

103
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,390
We still have such a long way to go.

104
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,260
Take care.

105
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,310
How long is it?

106
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,300
He's there.

107
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,730
- Let me support you. 
 - No, thanks. I can make it myself.

108
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,640
Li Xun, I...

109
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,570
Oh, my god.

110
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,280
Over there.

111
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,830
You are physically tough.

112
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,240
I can't climb anymore.

113
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,300
I-I can't.

114
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,960
- My legs. 
 - You came.

115
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,960
When did you come up?

116
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,900
This morning.

117
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,170
- How long have you been climbing? 
 - Two.

118
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,500
At least two and a half hours, what about you?

119
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,210
I didn't climb.

120
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,150
   

121
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,180
I...

122
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,930
Why didn't you tell us to come up by cable car?

123
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,700
There is a tool for us to get up the mountain faster. Why not use it?

124
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,460
Why did you ask us to come up here?

125
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,940
For enjoying the wind and sightseeing?

126
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,670
We have to learn to climb high and look far away.

127
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,260
Understand?

128
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,280
But you said we'd have a meeting.

129
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,850
Go ahead.

130
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,110
Old Gao, tell her.

131
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,920
Fine.

132
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,580
This is the Blue Crown app?

133
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,820
Yes.

134
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,790
You know about it, too?

135
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,400
I do.

136
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,620
When were you in collusion with him?

137
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,280
Collusion?

138
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,160
That day in Blue Crown, he also saw Han Jiakang.

139
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,480
He knew Zhang Xiaobei would come to us sooner or later to grab our web page project.

140
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,640
So we decided to advance secretly by an unknown path,

141
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,290
make an application by ourselves, and sell it directly to Blue Crown.

142
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,560
Why didn't you guys tell me about this?

143
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,650
Zhang Xiaobei keeps an eye on us in the base every day.

144
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,330
There are many people in the base.

145
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,420
The less people who know it, the better.

146
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,740
But why do you tell me now?

147
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,340
Of course, we want to ask you to join us.

148
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,750
How sincere you are.

149
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,500
Invite me?

150
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,390
What if I don't accept it?

151
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,150
Consider it.

152
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,940
Actually you lost nothing.

153
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,260
You just climbed the mountain in vain.

154
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,090
Tell me. What exactly will you do?

155
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,960
This is just a website, right?

156
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,800
Strictly speaking, it is not even a website.

157
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,330
These are developments and extensions of a certain function of the Blue Crown's website we worked on before.

158
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,160
Some of the functions are quite simple.

159
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,960
Blue Crown doesn't want to use any other platforms but wants to create their own website.

160
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
Their consideration is good.

161
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,600
But they don't know the current internet trends.

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,090
What trends?

163
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,250
Shopping websites have just emerged in recent years.

164
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,410
Although they seem to be in full bloom.

165
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,160
There are many sites but they didn't actually last long.

166
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,710
Most of the resources will get together on several large platforms.

167
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,590
It's pretty hard to build this kind of platform.

168
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,020
Can't we do it by ourselves?

169
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,890
Yes, we can.

170
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,310
But it'll take you ten years to make it.

171
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,540
Your Royal Highness.

172
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,550
- Don't call me like this. 
 - So how should I call you?

173
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,460
Forget it.

174
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,640
How many products does Blue Crown have? Do you remember that?

175
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,780
More than 500.

176
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,440
For hundreds of products, you can complete the search function alone.

177
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,390
But what if they have hundreds of millions of products, billions of products, or even tens of billions of products?

178
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,350
Like the Milky Way, no database will be able to store all these by then.

179
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,050
Then you need to start your research on distributed data storage.

180
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,880
Then you need to start your research on how to arrange these data

181
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,820
and recommend these data.

182
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,730
To add and delete each item, we need a strong algorithm to support them.

183
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,980
It won't cause the system to crash in this way.

184
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,050
If you were given a month, do you think you could make it?

185
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,140
It's just a function.

186
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,410
For a website like this, whether in the early or late stages,

187
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,760
it takes a lot of manpower and material resources.

188
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,010
We don't have enough manpower. Blue Crown does not have much money.

189
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,720
So, if we want to rely on our overall strength to compete with these large websites, it's very unrealistic.

190
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,620
The second trend is smart phone popularization.

191
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,190
So we give up making an all-in-one large website but instead go directly to making an app.

192
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,030
Even if the app is still new stuff, it's simple enough,

193
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,600
so it's developing and changing rapidly.

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,530
To make it stand-out, we still have to try some other ways.

195
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,230
Large platforms are characterized by a wide range of products.

196
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,860
The app should be targeted.

197
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,110
So we need to make a function both deep and targeted.

198
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,420
The advantage of Blue Crown is its nourishment products.

199
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,430
Its products have health care functions.

200
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,780
They are the vast majority.

201
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,370
And they are very special in style and unique in the market.

202
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,250
This may be associated with the Blue Crown boss's mother. She's engaged in traditional Chinese medicine.

203
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,150
You even know that their boss's mother is engaged in traditional Chinese medicine.

204
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,760
Yes.

205
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,530
Look here.

206
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,160
This function is mainly aimed at health care.

207
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,790
Generally, people know little about nourishment and health products.

208
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,420
They are too lazy to read instructions.

209
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,660
They don't read over them one by one.

210
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,730
So it's better to apply medicine according to indications.

211
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,810
Enter the symptoms here, like dizziness, nausea.

212
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,310
The system then recommends products directly

213
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,090
and the Blue Crown's products are arranged by series.

214
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,080
It's very easy to promote them in this way.

215
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,910
Should we add another function to explain the pathology,

216
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,830
simply describe the cause of the physical condition,

217
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,590
and then introduce the product formula that can solve the problem.

218
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,610
It'll be more convincing so that people are more eager to buy. Right?

219
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,680
Yes, good idea.

220
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,280
Today, Zhu Yun is joining tour team.

221
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,040
I declare that our Blue Crown app group is officially established.

222
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,600
I think we should take a picture to commemorate this moment.

223
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,920
Good.

224
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,960
One, two, three.

225
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,140
Your mind is wandering. What are you looking at?

226
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,050
You.

227
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,410
Can't I?

228
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,620
 You are watching me with your eyes but not your brain. 

229
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,240
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

230
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,060
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

231
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,500
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

232
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,120
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

233
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,020
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

234
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,500
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

235
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,640
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

236
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,620
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

237
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,060
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

238
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,140
 On that peaceful afternoon, 

239
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,160
 in the days when 4G was not yet popular, 

240
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,980
 smart phones were just emerging. 

241
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,180
 The three of us gathered at the top of Lishan Mountain, 

242
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,890
 and Li Xun shared his thoughts, his ideas, and his ambition. 

243
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,340
 I didn't know whether this app could be sold to Blue Crown successfully. 

244
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,220
 The only thing I am sure of was this memory 

245
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,610
 would be permanently stored in my brain. 

246
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,810
 At that moment, I really believed that our journey was as broad as the sea full of stars. 

247
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,580
Boss, I want to print it.

248
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,560
- What? 
 - A picture. And have it laminated.

249
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,670
- Do you bring a USB drive here? 
 - Let me print it by myself.

250
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,800
♫  Slowly missing you during the long night  ♫

251
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,280
♫  A moment of a fast beating heart  ♫

252
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,140
 So weird. 

253
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,800
It's so uncomfortable. He can sit like this every day.

254
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,980
♫  Slowly understanding you on the long road  ♫

255
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,440
♫  Without you, even joy feels lonely  ♫

256
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,840
♫  Looking at your white shirt  ♫

257
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,920
♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,960
♫  The secret I've been hiding  ♫

259
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,460
♫  I really want to be with you  ♫

260
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,460
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

261
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,700
♫  The knight and princess are destined to meet  ♫

262
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,820
♫  Let me feel and guard your  ♫

263
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,220
♫  simple wish  ♫

264
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,640
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

265
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,840
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

267
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,780
♫  You say every good night  ♫

268
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,200
♫  Happiness has never changed  ♫

269
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,020
   

270
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,220
Remember to eat well when you go back.

271
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
You, too.

272
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,930
Dine out if you don't like food in canteens.

273
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,860
Zhu Yun.

274
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,180
What? Come here.

275
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,400
Let me introduce him to you.

276
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,030
This is my senior Zhang Zhicheng.

277
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,950
- Hi! 
 - Hello.

278
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,410
   

279
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,640
I am leaving.

280
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,620
See you at tomorrow's party class.

281
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,560
Don't be late.

282
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,590
Fang Shumiao, when did you start to date him secretly and hide it from me?

283
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,470
The day is so clear. Secretly?

284
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,840
When did you have a boyfriend? You didn't tell me.

285
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,420
Is he the senior who distributed textbooks before?

286
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,860
Well.

287
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,110
I told you when school started, we had to protect ourselves from fire, theft, and seniors.

288
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,120
In fact, you keep him for yourself.

289
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,750
Don't talk nonsense. I'm not in love.

290
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,420
No? What did I see just now?

291
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,170
You behaved like a hoodlum?

292
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,350
I met him in a party class.

293
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,320
He has dated me several times.

294
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,020
Generally speaking, he should be my boyfriend.

295
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,180
But I want to see if I can try to take to him.

296
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,420
Try to take to him?

297
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,220
Zhu Yun, have you never been in love before?

298
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,670
What does it really feel like if you like a boy?

299
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,160
If I was absent-minded in a kiss,

300
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,760
I shouldn't be in love.

301
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,280
I think when you like a boy, you will think that he's very good at everything.

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,600
You have no room for anyone else in your heart.

303
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,730
You just want to protect him.

304
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,550
She is so rude.

305
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,700
 That's Zhang Xiaobei's car. 

306
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,960
 Why is she coming here? 

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,480
You gave these papers to Blue Crown.

308
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,920
What is wrong with the app?

309
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,690
The app, generally speaking, is just the mobile terminal applet.

310
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,630
The main role is to improve the functionality and personalization of the original system.

311
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,000
You.

312
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,920
Li Xun, and for this, are you playing tricks?

313
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,790
You seem to work on the website

314
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,290
but are actually on the app secretly and selling it to Party A.

315
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,520
You have a lot of nerve.

316
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,430
I am flattered.

317
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,900
Blue Crown has just informed me to terminate the website project.

318
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,040
Do you know what it means?

319
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,300
I have invested one year's budget in this project this year.

320
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,640
Once the project is terminated, it means that students of the entire graduate college

321
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,620
like Han Jiakang have to lose their jobs.

322
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,150
What do you want to do?

323
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,600
It's not true, Miss Zhang.

324
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,710
For your company, the profit from this project is just your peanut at best.

325
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,730
But for seniors like Han Jiakang,

326
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,380
he has been working for you for free for almost a year.

327
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,950
Zhang Xiaobei.

328
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
I won't do nothing.

329
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,000
If it weren't for you, you would still have a little value to me now.

330
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,350
I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with you.

331
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,190
I'll give you a chance to make amends.

332
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,510
Sell this app to me.

333
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,910
- How much? 
 - It is negotiable.

334
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,560
This is easy to say

335
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,020
Spit out all the project fees you withheld from us.

336
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,660
Close the graduate school-enterprise cooperation center and merge it into my base.

337
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,950
It will not be at your disposal.

338
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,670
That's all the conditions.

339
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,280
Asking you to make an offer is to save you face.

340
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,450
Don't be arrogant.

341
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,480
Li Xun, you're a smart man.

342
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,670
Know that fighting against me isn't going to end well.

343
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,390
Conduct oneself well.

344
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,230
Miss Zhang, if you have nothing else to say, I'm leaving.

345
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,380
Your family is in a difficult situation, right?

346
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,900
I checked it and found that your information was changed,

347
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,970
including your family's phone and address.

348
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,030
All of them were changed.

349
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,280
The school cannot even contact any of your relatives.

350
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,400
But luckily I found your original archives from your high school days.

351
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,140
Li Xun, you were expelled from Linyang No.8 Middle School.

352
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,050
There are punishments on your disciplinary record.

353
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,110
You even repeated a year.

354
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,390
Is that right?

355
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,410
The school is proud of you right now because of your best performance as the top scorer.

356
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,560
It's why they approved the base for you.

357
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,140
Record fraud is a big deal.

358
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,190
The No. 1 Scholar once cheated in exams.

359
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,720
This is good news material.

360
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,690
You should know what happens if it is released.

361
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,820
I did not cheat.

362
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,760
If you can check it,

363
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,980
the school can check it, too.

364
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,730
That's right.

365
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,490
You don't have to explain that to me.

366
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,350
I don't care.

367
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,600
I say this just to show you that I understand your difficulties.

368
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,800
So I don't blame you for the matter of Blue Crown.

369
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,400
But you always have to learn from it and be responsible for the mistakes you have made.

370
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,580
For whatever you owe me, you have to give it back to me, too.

371
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,530
If you apologize to me now, it's not late.

372
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,310
There is no point in fighting against me.

373
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,660
Which choice is better?

374
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,670
Consider it yourself.

375
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,240
See it?

376
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,380
How is it? You can see it.

377
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,400
- Good. Good. 
 - And here.

378
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
- They are the same. 
 - Move again. Move again.

379
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,350
How is it? Is it good?

380
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,550
Fantastic. After all, it is new.

381
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,690
- We don't have any in our school. 
 - Of course.

382
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,400
This thing is not only expensive but also should be updated often.

383
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,200
Not to mention your art school, among colleges and universities across the country,

384
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,890
there are very few schools that own this set of equipment.

385
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,390
-  Old Gao is so great. 
 - Are they permitting you to manage the money only to have it spent here?

386
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,240
Come on, guys. I also spent a lot of my own money.

387
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,700
But with this set of equipment, we can achieve a lot of new functions.

388
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,350
Wow!

389
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,250
Awesome!

390
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,740
You have seen the equipment. Let's talk about the price.

391
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,340
Let's go.

392
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,580
That's awesome.

393
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,050
This is the head of our project.

394
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,120
Hello.

395
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,950
I agree with your offer.

396
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,150
No need, no need.

397
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,800
This is equivalent to giving us free training.

398
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,670
After we learn this system, it will be very helpful for us to look for jobs later on.

399
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,510
Right.

400
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,900
That's good.

401
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,310
The base is available 24 hours a day. You can use it anytime.

402
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,870
Perfect. Thank you. Thank you.

403
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,150
Then you can debug it again.

404
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,760
Zhu Yun, take a look at our motion capture system.

405
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
Make way for us.

406
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,600
You see, all the functions we said before can be realized.

407
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
This can capture the ankle and knee joints.

408
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,720
See?

409
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,810
Move the head.

410
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,640
Fine. How is it?

411
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,320
- The temples can also be captured. 
 - It's so clear with no delay.

412
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,900
Why are you watching me? Are you a sunflower?

413
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,480
Look there.

414
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,790
 It's clear. 

415
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,420
Brother, go a little further from behind.

416
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,040
- Look at it. Can it capture? 
 - Yes. Yes. Yes.

417
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,760
Move again as you did just now.

418
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,000
More clearly.

419
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,590
Fine.

420
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,560
Why are you here?

421
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,830
Just in time. Let me introduce them to you.

422
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,650
This is Xiao Liuzi.  You've met him before.

423
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,520
This is the keyboardist, Ling.

424
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,110
This is our bassist, Xin.

425
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,130
- You're so cute, too. 
 - Take your time.

426
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,080
-  I'm just here to listen to a song. 
 - Okay.

427
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,710
- Then let's do it once again. 
 - Okay?

428
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,370
For this chord just now, I think it's okay.

429
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,950
- I think it's okay. 
 - That's it.

430
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,280
Practice it again.

431
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,580
What is up? In a bad mood?

432
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,190
Do you have any wine?

433
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,620
You want to drink wine.

434
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,490
If you drink too much, I won't take care of you at all.

435
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,060
   

436
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,310
Bye-bye.

437
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,700
Bye.

438
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Be careful on the way.

439
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,480
She has drunk so much.

440
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,340
Such a big deal.

441
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,600
Your face looks so bad.

442
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,900
Tell me. Who has treated you badly?

443
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,400
Zhang Xiaobei.

444
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,480
Who? Is she a teacher at our school?

445
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,110
No.

446
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,280
What's it for? Fight with her.

447
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,870
As long as it doesn't affect your diploma, run after scolding her.

448
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,540
What can she do with you?

449
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,200
What if she can decide the fate of our base?

450
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,020
Then tolerate her.

451
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,490
You are so timid.

452
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,930
No, this is called wisdom. Survival wisdom.

453
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,040
A man is able to bow and rise at will.

454
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,180
It's a long way to go.

455
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,710
It doesn't matter to bow down right now.

456
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,920
I can bow down but he can't.

457
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,530
Who is he?

458
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,690
I won't allow it.

459
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,990
Why did you come to me?

460
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,100
For the development of the Blue Crown app, I have been involved the whole way.

461
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,790
Li Xun has only completed more than half of it so far.

462
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,560
But I know all about the basic structures.

463
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,680
Then you came to show your sincerity on behalf of the base, right?

464
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,740
No, purely on the behalf of myself.

465
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,790
It's also pretty good at the base.

466
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,100
But you know, Li Xun is very stubborn.

467
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,500
And no matter whatever we do at the base, they're all trivial.

468
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,270
But, Miss Zhang, you own so many platform resources and contacts.

469
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,580
Please help me.

470
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:08,600
You young people like to refuse the easy way but choose the hard way.

471
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,120
I'm an old hand.

472
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,100
About which projects are good and will be helpful to your future,

473
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,440
I know so well.

474
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,580
Well, Zhu Yun.

475
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,100
Come to work for me. I can give you a month of probation.

476
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,000
Go back and persuade Li Xun to hand over the app.

477
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,350
Okay, I will certainly not let you down.

478
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,900
Senior. Senior!

479
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,500
You all act like this?

480
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,780
What do you mean?

481
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,830
You seldom speak.

482
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,790
There are special circumstances here.

483
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,000
Everyone is strictly required to stay in the computer room all day from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

484
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,370
Zhang Xiaobei said we must try our best to work on that app

485
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,400
and make a better one before Li Xun finishes it.

486
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,080
I can give you a week.  Is that enough?

487
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,390
Almost.

488
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,840
Work hard.

489
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,510
She was so mad that the Blue Crown project was terminated.

490
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,580
Just pointing and taking your things to vent her anger.

491
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,900
I have a lot of pressure.

492
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,080
Li Xun.

493
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,190
Miss Zhang.

494
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,670
What's up?

495
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,170
You came out so late.

496
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,880
It seems that it has been going very well recently.

497
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,720
Thanks for your concern.

498
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,370
I want to ask you again.

499
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,950
Hand the app out. We can work together.

500
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,110
Are you willing?

501
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,660
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,210
That's all right. Never mind.

503
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,220
Goodbye.

504
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,700
By the way, I almost forgot to tell you that

505
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,600
Zhu Yun is working for me right now on developing an app for Blue Crown.

506
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,260
When the time comes, they should be comparable.

507
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,550
After all, it's normal to shop around.

508
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,810
   

509
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,800
Why does Li Xun call me?

510
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,630
Tell him that I'm out.

511
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,170
Hello.

512
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,170
 Ask Zhu Yun to go downstairs. 

513
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,070
He asked you to go down right now.

514
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,720
Didn't I ask you to tell him I'm gone?

515
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,520
You heard it yourself.

516
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,480
Did he ask me?

517
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,990
 Zhu Yun, don't pretend to be dead. 

518
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,860
I just didn't hear it.

519
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,520
Come out.

520
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,880
It's already late. It's 10:00.

521
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,250
I'm at the door of your dormitory.

522
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,910
I'm giving you one minute.

523
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,900
One minute?

524
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,100
I am wearing pajamas. I can't jump down.

525
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,290
Change your clothes and jump down.

526
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,820
Hello.

527
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,440
Do you really have to go down?

528
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,450
I don't even know why he is angry with me.

529
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,910
You are going to go down looking like that?

530
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,140
What else? Do I have to see him in another suit?

531
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,050
Are you out of your mind?

532
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,810
Be polite.

533
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,510
Do you think Zhang Xiaobei really believes that you betrayed us?

534
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's go over there and talk.

535
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,750
Tell me what you are thinking.

536
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,840
You dare to laugh?

537
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,180
Refuse her.

538
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,340
I have promised to help Zhang Xiaobei.

539
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,100
- I am asking you to refuse her. 
 - Why?

540
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,800
You really want to help Zhang Xiaobei make this app?

541
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,870
Yes.

542
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,850
And you are going to copy the same structure as mine.

543
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,450
Copy?

544
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,910
Have you registered the patent for it or released it to the public?

545
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,160
Why do you say that I'm copying yours?

546
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,370
Do you know exactly what she is going to do?

547
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,840
Your conflict with her is none of my business.

548
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,310
I'll say it again for the last time.

549
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,910
Refuse her.

550
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,890
Li Xun, I think you misunderstood something.

551
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,040
Get to the point.

552
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,220
What is the relationship between us?

553
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,750
I am not your subordinate

554
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,200
but just an ordinary and equal classmate.

555
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,060
Although I respect your leadership in the base

556
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,140
and quite recognize your leadership skills,

557
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,740
first, we have no verbal agreement;

558
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,100
second, we have no service contract.

559
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,570
I don't think you have any good reason for me to listen to you.

560
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,960
We are just ordinary and equal classmates.

561
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,530
What else?

562
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,840
Zhu Yun, we have no equal relationship?

563
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,430
What kind of illusion did I give you so that you think you can abuse me?

564
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,440
I'm out of here.

565
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,860
Zhu Yun.

566
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,220
Don't go back to the base if you don't refuse her.

567
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,570
I forgot to tell you that I have moved to Han Jiakang's computer room.

568
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,000
Bye-bye.

569
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,450
No problem, no problem.

570
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,760
I can definitely finish the progress as I promised you.

571
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,190
Don't worry.

572
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,410
Good. Good, goodbye.

573
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,200
What's going on?

574
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,260
I am combing it. It should be fine tomorrow.

575
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,040
Run it and show me.

576
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,990
I'm still debugging it.

577
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,340
   
     

578
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,700
   
       

579
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,690
Finish it a little faster. 
    

580
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,230
Repair all the errors and the alarm quickly.

581
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,430
Run the codes first. All right.

582
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,360
- I got it. 
 - I can't wait for it tomorrow. Work overtime and finish it tonight.

583
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,200
I changed the water in the water dispenser.

584
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,480
Leave it to me later on.

585
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,440
It was something easy. I am leaving. Bye-bye.

586
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,810
Bye-bye.

587
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,320
What are you doing?

588
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,050
I don't like him.

589
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,590
Really?

590
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,700
I like a boy that I can look up to and follow after,

591
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,310
rather than this one, cleaning and cooking.

592
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,220
You two complement each other.

593
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,920
He can take care of you. How good that is.

594
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,670
How is it good?

595
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,380
He treats me so well that I feel sick actually.

596
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,390
I am not touched at all.

597
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,940
I will not fall in love with him.

598
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,390
If you like a boy, it should feel very passionate and romantic.

599
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,850
It comes at the right time, not earlier, nor later.

600
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,840
Why are you laughing?

601
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,920
It's so awkward to hear these words from you.

602
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,280
This is my creation.

603
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,530
You've been here for an hour already.

604
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,460
You haven't opened your computer to write codes.

605
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,170
What is wrong?

606
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,870
Has Zhu Yun been here these two days?

607
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,640
She's hiding from you?

608
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,430
Her?

609
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,060
The night before yesterday, she wrote code all night here.

610
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,890
Did you bully her?

611
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,070
No, I didn't.

612
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,420
Who bullied her?

613
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,930
Did someone bully you?

614
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,160
Zhu Yun came here last Friday night.

615
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,140
She drank too much and shouted something.

616
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,400
"I can bow down but he can't.

617
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,440
I definitely won't allow it!"

618
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,530
I didn't understand her anyway.

619
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,520
Did she mention you?

620
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,680
Why are you here?

621
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,160
How are you doing?

622
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,360
What do you mean?

623
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,840
Are you being abused by Zhang Xiaobei?

624
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,850
I'm fine.

625
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,590
Compared to Boss Li, she appears insignificant.

626
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,840
Those of us who can survive in the base have top-notch immune systems.

627
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,130
What on earth are you thinking?

628
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,460
What if Zhang Xiaobei finds out?

629
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,690
Finds what?

630
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,860
You really think you can fool her?

631
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,200
I don't intend to fool her.

632
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,870
Did you hear what she said to me?

633
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,620
Do you think I work for Zhang Xiaobei for your sake?

634
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,700
Don't overestimate yourself.

635
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,700
 This guy is out of control, too. 

636
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,700
   

637
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,300
Senior.

638
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,450
What's wrong with you?

639
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:35,010
You're finished.

640
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,670
Zhang Xiaobei was scolded by Blue Crown.

641
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,920
She came over early in the morning and got angry. She is looking for you.

642
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,620
Me?

643
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,760
Zhu Yun,

644
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,880
she asked me about your app.

645
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,520
- I... 
 - It doesn't matter.

646
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,820
I can't hide it.

647
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,660
Students now are quite arrogant.

648
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,870
You made trouble at such a young age!

649
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,350
Zhu Yun, do you think you are quite great?

650
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,040
I'm asking you.

651
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,570
I don't understand what you mean.

652
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:18,870


653
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,490
   

654
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,850
 Apologize to Zhu Yun. 

655
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:30,860
 I would save so much more effort if I knew I could control you through her. 

656
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,810
 But you know him very well. 

657
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,770
 Zhu Yun. 

658
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,590
 Mom. 

659
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,900
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

660
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,580
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

661
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,540
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

662
00:44:52,540 --> 00:45:00,240
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

663
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,960
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

664
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,440
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

665
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:17,380
♫  We will not separate  ♫

666
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,500
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

667
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,940
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

668
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,980
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

669
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:37,140
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

670
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,820
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

671
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,280
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

672
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,480
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

673
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,060
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

674
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:02,620
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

675
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,080
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

676
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,460
♫  That hot firework  ♫

677
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:20,460
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

678
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,920
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

679
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:41,540
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

680
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,840
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

681
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:51,420
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

682
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,660
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

683
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,140
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

684
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,360
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

685
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,960
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

686
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,520
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

687
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,120
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

688
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,640
♫  True love will take its course ♫

689

♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

690

♫  True love will take its course  ♫

693
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,880
