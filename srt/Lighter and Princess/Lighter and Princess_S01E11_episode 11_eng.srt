00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:14,980


2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,100
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,200
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,270
 I changed the scores of the unified exams. 

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,530
 It has nothing to do with others. 

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,620
 You can expel me from school. 

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,600
 Cheating in the exams is a serious offense. 

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,480
 Neither of you can escape punishment. 

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,710
 This isn't negotiable. 

28
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,500
 Director Liu. 

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,570
It was him.

30
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,880
But it was the past.

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,000
There must have been something behind his cheating.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,870
He couldn't cheat in the college entrance examination.

33
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,220
He's really an excellent student.

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,130
Mr. Lin said he's a genius in programming.

35
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,980
I don't care about his reason.

36
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,590
It was wrong for him to cheat.

37
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,860
Listen.

38
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,940
It's even terrible if one misuses his talent.

39
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,640
How can we describe such people? They're villains, with abilities but no principles.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,080
This has been true since ancient times.

41
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,810
I heard from Miss Zhang that your practice base is used to get the second-class credits.

42
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,460
You're a freshman.

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Take your time.

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,940
I think now you should first learn basic knowledge well and then carry out practice later.

45
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,500
Or your university studies will become a castle in the air and a rootless tree.

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,940
Don't go to the practice base now.

47
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,820
I'll spend less time on it.

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,020
Mr. Lin said that practice is the most important element in programming learning.

49
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,570
If I don't disable several keyboards, I won't become a good programmer.

50
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,590
Mom, get in, please.

51
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,660
Then you can go on taking part in that practice base.

52
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,910
Thank you, Mom.

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,770
But remember to keep away from the boy named Li Xun.

54
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,890
He's not suitable for you.

55
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,230
Try to keep away from him.

56
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,010
I'll leave first.

57
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,110
Li Xun, guess what I just ate.

58
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,810
Pitaya with Lao Gan Ma sauce.

59
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,110
My mother was shocked.

60
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,810
You ate all my bread.

61
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,230
Remember to buy it for me tomorrow.

62
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,440
Li Xun, are you from Linyang?

63
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,060
Did you graduate from Linyang No. 8 Middle School?

64
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,780
In my junior year, I cheated in the unified exams.

65
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,200
It's your mom who punished me personally.

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,300
You really cheated in the unified exams?

67
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,630
Why?

68
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,500
- Is it important? 
 - Sure.

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,940
You must have had a reason.

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,570
What is this?

71
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,090
Are you going to fix the wrong for me and restore my exam results?

72
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,720
There's something you will never understand.

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,140
Tell me.

74
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,620
How can I know if you don't tell me?

75
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,120
Princess, do you think we're the same as you?

76
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,470
Why are we different?

77
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,300
How did you get back the app from Zhang Xiaobei?

78
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,420
Swallowing humiliation in Zhang Xiaobei's company for years, Han Jiakang got nothing.

79
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,210
But you could let Zhang Xiaobei apologize to you.

80
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,230
Why?

81
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,980
Your mom told you to stay away from me, right?

82
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,990
Yes.

83
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,020
Then, why don't you ask me about my answer?

84
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,860
She's right.

85
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,910
We're completely different.

86
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,620
   

87
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,360
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

88
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,840
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

89
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,220
♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

90
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,420
♫  Have you ever changed?  ♫

91
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,990
 Why do you call me Princess? 

92
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,180
 Hello. May I ask who you are looking for? 

93
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:40,870
 Happy birthday to you! 

94
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:55,380
 Happy birthday to you! 

95
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,780
 What can I do for you? 

96
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,150
 I'm Li Xun from Linyang No. 8 Middle School. 

97
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,980
 I have an impression of you. 

98
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,880
 I changed the scores of the unified exams. 

99
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,140
 It has nothing to do with others. 

100
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,810
 You can expel me from school. 

101
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,180
 It's the first time I've seen a student like you. 

102
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,570
 You made a mistake, but you still talk to me so courageously. 

103
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,560
 It's not the food market where you can bargain. 

104
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,480
 You made a mistake, so you must be punished accordingly. 

105
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,700
 And mistakes you youth make must be corrected and held accountable whenever discovered. 

106
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,710
 In this case, you can grow up healthily. 

107
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,660
 It's my mistake. 

108
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,160
 I'm willing to accept punishment. 

109
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,690
 But it has nothing to do with Fu Yizhuo, 

110
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
 so you can't expel him from school. 

111
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,790
 Director Liu, 

112
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,570
 you can punish me any way you like. 

113
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,060
 Can you understand what I just said? 

114
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,040
 Cheating in the exams is a serious offense. 

115
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,870
 Neither of you can escape punishment. 

116
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,320
 This isn't negotiable. 

117
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,350
 Go back now. 

118
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,960
 Director Liu. 

119
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,970
 Classmate... Classmate... 

120
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,300
 Take this umbrella. 

121
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,800
Will Liuzi leave?

122
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,760
He'll leave for Beijing.

123
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,120
What about your band?

124
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,390
Boss Li, don't worry.

125
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,610
Even if we really disband, I'll return you every penny you invested.

126
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,540
That's not what I mean.

127
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,180
It's good.

128
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,920
Since it's impossible for you to be together,

129
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,120
just end this relationship early.

130
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,760
Actually, he's a nice guy.

131
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,080
You're right.

132
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,900
I don't know love and romance.

133
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,200
Love is prone to be a person's weakness,

134
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,500
it can also be the strongest armor.

135
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,340
I think love is the very thing best worth trying

136
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,230
and pursing without hesitation in the world.

137
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,700
You're so sentimental today. I'm leaving.

138
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,300
It's raining heavily. Where will you go?

139
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,600
Don't you consider your personal love?

140
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,030
No, I don't.

141
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,720
I have no weakness, nor do I need any armor.

142
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,360
Wu Mengxing, help me pick it up.

143
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,890
Why don't you do it yourself?

144
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,980
It doesn't matter. Let me help you.

145
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,280
Here.

146
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,610
Thank you.

147
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,560
Would you like some hot water?

148
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,680
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you?

149
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,400
 No way! He has never said "thank you" to me. 

150
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,990
It doesn't matter.

152
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,100
 What's wrong with him today? What does he want to do? 

153
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,400
Old Gao, I sent you a document,

154
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,100
in which there are all the health product projects of Blue Crown Company and the detailed description,

155
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,610
formula ingredients and treatment direction of each product.

156
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,480
You may ask me if you have any questions.

157
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,690
I saw it.

158
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I'm back now, so I can help you write apps.

159
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,480
We're not short of hands.

160
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,800
We learned the definition of function limit in the previous lessons.

161
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,070
We usually don't work out the function limits by definition

162
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,100
as it is rather troublesome.

163
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,300
- In today's lesson… 
  - The more I come into contact with Li Xun, 

164
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,560
the more difficult it is to understand him.

165
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,680
 Sometimes I think I'm close to him, but he treats me coldly. 

166
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,580
   

167
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,280
Do any of you know what this means?

168
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,060
Zhu Yun.

169
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,180
Zhu Yun.

170
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,470
Don't you want to know my answer?

171
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,000
My mom told me to stay away from you. But I said no.

172
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,390
- The apps of Blue Crown… 
 - I don't need you.

173
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,590
Are you going to drive me away?

174
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,470
I said I don't need you. Can't you understand?

175
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,290
You're so strange.

176
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,830
I have to work. You can leave.

177
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,900
Li Xun, it's you who invited me to the practice base.

178
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,450
I don't come as soon as called, nor do I leave at random.

179
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,190
Don't think to drive me away.

180
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,820
     

181
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,990
Li Xun, I applied for the volleyball course for you but you've been absent for several times.

182
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,340
If you don't go to class again, you'll fail it.

183
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Well, which school are you from?

184
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,190
The School of Computer Science.

185
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,700
If I had normal network signals, I wouldn't come to play volleyball.

186
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,140
What about you?

187
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,760
I also have abnormal network signals.

188
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,020
Well, everyone, fall in.

189
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,110
It's time for class.

190
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,140
Let's do some warm-up exercises.

191
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,100
Move your wrists and ankles.

192
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,410
Who is he?

193
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,840
He's Jiang Xingchi.

194
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,950
The student with special sports talent in Class 2

195
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,380
and a national second-class athlete.

196
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,450
He's also the attacker on our university's volleyball team.

197
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,100
Then, why does he still come to have volleyball class?

198
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,280
He likes to show himself off.

199
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,520
Turn your waists.

200
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,080
Everyone, listen.

201
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,610
We have new students today, so I'll teach you how to serve again.

202
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,030
There're many ways to serve in volleyball.

203
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:52,800
You should master the most basic and simplest way, underhand service from the side.

204
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,220
I'll ask Jiang Xingchi to show it to you.

205
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,500
First, stand with your side facing the net.

206
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,200
The distance between your feet is slightly wider than your shoulders.

207
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
Slightly bend your legs.

208
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,500
Hold the ball with your left hand in front of your chest and abdomen.

209
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,890
Slightly throw the ball up vertically.

210
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,760
Then swing your right hand backward and take your shoulder as the axis.

211
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,240
When the ball falls into the proper area,

212
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,420
go and serve it with the part between the center of your palm and the side of your palm.

213
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,690
Well, Jiang Xingchi, serve.

214
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,930
Got it?

215
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,160
 Yes. 

216
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,190
Then start practicing.

217
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,790
Try to find the right service way.

218
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,800
If you have any questions, you can come to me or Jiang Xingchi.

219
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,100
The new students can learn from those with service experience.

220
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,220
Go and practice.

221
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,210
 Okay. 

222
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,360
Hurry up and be serious.

223
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
Zhu Yun.

224
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
Thank you.

225
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,610
Zhu Yun.

226
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,100
Try-Try serving the ball with this part.

227
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,240
Have a try.

228
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,190
Yes.

229
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,460
No.

230
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,100
In fact, you should guarantee the tension of this part of your arm.

231
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,070
- Serve the ball with this part.  
 - Try.

232
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,160
Okay, I'll have a try.

233
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,660
Are you okay?

234
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,420
Let me check.

235
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,210
Why-Why is it so red?

236
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,710
What's wrong?

237
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,400
She's hurt.

238
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,990
Let me see.

239
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,680
- Can you move your wrist? 
 - Yes.

240
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,860
Can you feel tingling pain?

241
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,370
A bit.

242
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,060
It's not serious, but be careful.

243
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,850
- How about I send her to the infirmary? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

244
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,110
I can go myself.

245
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,750
Well, let me send you there. I'm familiar with going there.

246
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,930
Okay.

247
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,500
Yes. Jiang, send her to the infirmary.

248
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,550
You actually served in the wrong way.

249
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,010
If you had tensed this part of your arm, you wouldn't have hurt your arm.

250
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,090
Well, go on practicing.

251
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,180
Listen carefully. New students shouldn't serve the ball by force before mastering the right way.

252
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,870
- Be careful. 
 - Okay. Okay.

253
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,000
It isn't serious. Use ice to reduce her swelling.

254
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,790
Yes. Okay.

255
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,310
- Don't worry. 
 - Thank you.

256
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,340
Let me do it myself.

257
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,420
- I'll help you. 
 - I can do it myself.

258
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,970
Let me help you.

259
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,460
Does it hurt?

260
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,680
Are you from Class 1 of the School of Computer Science?

261
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,090
I saw your show in our university's art performance.

262
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,320
- You're nicknamed Piggy, right? 
  - You're the pig head. 

263
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,670
It doesn't matter. I can handle it myself.

264
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,400
The time isn't up. Apply it for a bit longer.

265
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,510
You don't exercise often, right?

266
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,020
In fact, new learners like you get hurt most easily.

267
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,260
The volleyball is very hard.

268
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,700
No. The volleyballs we use in class are all soft.

269
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,300
We usually use hard ones for training and games.

270
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,500
If you use our balls, you'll be badly hurt.

271
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,450
Really?

272
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,480
If you don't believe me, I'll take you to watch our training and show you a smash.

273
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,210
Are you on our university's volleyball team?

274
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,700
Yes. You don't know.

275
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,380
Let me tell you.

276
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,600
 Before we came, the school's team could go to the next step depending on luck. 

277
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,290
However, after we joined, we've become one of the top six quickly.

278
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,210
And I'm still the MVP of our university.

279
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,920
Oh, the boys in your class are so weak.

280
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,090
They're too frail to stand a gust of wind.

281
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,320
Especially, that boy who was absent several times is just like a chicken.

282
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,590
 You know nothing. 

283
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,800
 I dream of staying with him stably and peacefully. 

284
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,720
It's okay. It doesn't hurt. I'll leave first.

285
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,600
Hi, could I have your WeChat account? In this case, we may keep in touch in the future.

286
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,540
There's no need.

287
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,340
Classmate.

288
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,530
Could I have your WeChat account?

289
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,010
In this case, we may keep in touch in the future.

290
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,760
You got hurt in volleyball class.

291
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,450
Coach Tang asked me to follow up with your condition.

292
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,870
If you can't go to class next time, I can ask for leave for you.

293
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,720
Okay.

294
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,330
Scan my QR code.

295
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,840
What are you doing?

296
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,430
Did you do it on purpose?

297
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,650
Sorry.

298
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,500
If your smart phone doesn't work, I can repair it for you.

299
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,100
I'm Li Xun from Computer Applied Technology Class 1.

300
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,040
You've gone too far.

301
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,100
Repay me if it doesn't work.

302
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,010
 Will you drive me away? You actually thought out such an idea. 

303
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,980
   
 Thank you for taking the time to come to my class 

304
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,960
   
 and listen Chinese medicine basic knowledge. 

305
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,040
Our whole body is full of channels,

306
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,780
which are the major passages for the movement of human qi and blood.

307
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,460
And they are also the main paths combining various human parts.

308
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,670
In fact, we may have small illnesses in life, such as headaches, slight fevers, and other common illnesses.

309
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:04,190
For example, smartphone addicts easily have sore cervical spines.

310
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,280
Where is the acupoint?

311
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,320
Dazhui acupoint.

312
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,250
Just here.

313
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,730
If you have a sore cervical spine, you can massage this acupoint.

314
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,620
Massage it. Yes.

315
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,440
Wu Mengxing! Wu Mengxing! Take this.

316
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,150
 But the release time is fixed. 

317
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,620
 If we don't do it now, we'll be more pressed for time later. 

318
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,880
We thought our interface system was very complicated.

319
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,680
Why don't we adopt the design of the manikin directly?

320
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,900
 It's a good idea. 

321
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,830
See. If this is our interface,

322
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,560
the users can choose their sore parts from the manikin.

323
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,650
We can design a pop-up with options and descriptions of the illnesses, which is more instructive.

324
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,730
We can establish a model according to this manikin

325
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,820
and divide the human body into several parts,

326
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,970
such as the head, limbs, waist, and back.

327
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,970
In this way, we can have a more unified system.

328
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,520
 Very good. 

329
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,770
Is it okay, Group Leader Li?

330
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,280
Group Leader Li, what do you think of it? Will we take her advice?

331
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,430
He doesn't say no, so I think he agrees.

332
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,680
 So arrogant. Only I can help you. 

333
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,920
- Deng Jia? 
 - Yes.

334
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,360
- Du Ting? 
 - Yes.

335
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,080
Coach, all are present.

336
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,590
Go back to your position.

337
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,680
Everyone, you'll practice in groups this class.

338
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,770
You can practice in pairs. Make pairs at will.

339
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,330
Coach, can a boy and a girl form a group?

340
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,980
Sure.

341
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,770
But you'd better choose a partner of similar strength.

342
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,460
In this way, all of you can practice effectively.

343
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay. Make groups.

344
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,080
Zhu Yun, why don't we make a group?

345
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,110
We're greatly mismatched.

346
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,340
It doesn't matter. I can teach you.

347
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,400
And I can also protect you.

348
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,250
What's your opinion?

349
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,740
You acted so fast.

350
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,480
Okay, report your grouping.

351
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,250
Li Xun and Jiang Xingchi

352
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,160
I don't want to form a group with you.

353
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,010
Don't you want to compete with me?

354
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,670
You're asking for trouble.

355
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,080
Will we continue?

356
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,620
Yes.

357
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,250
Jiang Xingchi, let me be your partner.

358
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,290
Come on.

359
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,850
Don't come here.

360
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,520
- Serve. 
 - Stand aside.

361
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,220
Well.

362
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,850
What does she want to do?

363
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,930
Actually, you didn't have to compete with Jiang Xingchi

364
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,690
as he's a national second-class athlete

365
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,530
and the main attacker of the volleyball team of our university.

366
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,520
You're no match for him.

367
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,280
It seems that you admire him very much.

368
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,630
No. But he's just gifted in sports.

369
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,690
Is he? Is he?

370
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,740
Let me go. There are people coming and going.

371
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,080
- Am I powerful? 
 - Let me go.

372
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,340
Am I powerful?

373
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,380
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

374
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,580
Will you praise him next time?

375
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,590
It's just a fact.

376
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,520
- Go back to work with me in the base. 
 - Didn't you fire me?

377
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,260
   

378
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,860
Fang Shumiao, why do you take out all your clothes?

379
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,540
You came back just in time.

380
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,420
Do you have time on the weekend?

381
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,970
- What do you want me to do? 
 - Go out with me.

382
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,790
It's improper for me to disturb the date of a senior and you.

383
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm not going out with him.

384
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,990
Are you cheating on him?

385
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,240
Zhu Yun, please be careful of what you say.

386
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,790
I'm not cheating on him.

387
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,310
I just have the most popular dates with him,

388
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,340
but we haven't confirmed our relationship,

389
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,710
so both of us are free.

390
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,870
Well.

391
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,960
See, it's just him.

392
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,330
   

393
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,780
Super Man.

394
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,190
What a rustic name.

395
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,590
This is his online nickname.

396
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,700
We didn't meet, but we've talked happily. We plan to meet on the weekend.

397
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,350
You may feel awfully disappointed after seeing him.

398
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,010
But it's good for you to meet him.

399
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,180
If you think he's not suitable for you, you can break up soon.

400
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,450
Zhu Yun, I think I'll meet my Mr. Right this time.

401
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,870
Which one do you think is better?

402
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,730
You were cheated by the seller show, right?

403
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,760
Is it so obvious?

404
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,810
The blue one is better. Don't put it in your trousers.

405
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,010
I'll try.

406
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,730
- Are you going on a date? 
 - Yes.

407
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,280
To avoid the extremely embarrassing meeting scene, I found a helper.

408
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,880
- Who? 
 - You.

409
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,960
I won't go.

410
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,650
Do you want to watch me take risks alone?

411
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,820
Don't wash your hair or put on makeup or wear high-heeled shoes on the weekend.

412
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,160
Then I'll have to keep silent and maintain a poker face when you date, okay?

413
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,410
Yes.

414
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,100
To avoid your embarrassment, I also found another person.

415
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,560
Who?

416
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,430
Wu Mengxing.

417
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,770
Fang Shumiao organized a small fellowship meeting.

418
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,290
We'll go out on the weekend.

419
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,870
I wonder whether she invited others.

420
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,770
Our class rep is also joining.

421
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,250
What fellowship meeting?

422
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,200
I don't know. There're boys from other departments.

423
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,320
Does the blue one really look better?

424
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,250
Come over.

425
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,690
Do you know why Fang Shumiao invited you?

426
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,640
Don't worry. Dress yourself well.

427
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,170
    
 But I can't drive a kart.

428
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,450
It doesn't matter. I'll teach you.

429
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,490
- Can you drive it? 
 - Sure. I've driven them several times.

430
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,670
Awesome.

431
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,500
It seems to be this car.

432
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,340
Is he the net friend you want to see?

433
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,350
Maybe.

434
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,660
Hello, I'm Fang Shumiao.

435
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,420
I'm Super Man.

436
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,080
Yes, he is.

437
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,170
Zhu Yun, we meet again.

438
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,750
So why did you ask me to come?

439
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,630
It's he who asked me to bring my roommate.

440
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,650
Do you know each other?

441
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,670
I have something else to do. Enjoy yourselves. I'll go first.

442
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,220
- No, Zhu Yun. 
 - Monitor, class rep.

443
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,280
Quickly, quickly.

444
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,290
- Did you invite Li Xun? 
 - I also wanted to ask you.

445
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,160
Well, Li Xun has no work to do at the base today.

446
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,650
It's a fellowship meeting.

447
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,950
I invited him to come with us.

448
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,900
Will you mind?

449
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,860
Li Xun is the major backbone of our class and this year's top scorer in science.

450
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,680
Can he join us?

451
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,900
Okay.

452
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,180
It's interesting to play with more people.

453
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,720
Get in.

454
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,440
Zhu Yun, get in.

455
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,020
Who is driving?

456
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,140
Monitor, you really drive…

457
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,840
Shut up!

458
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,380
…so fast.

459
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,760
Do you feel crowded? Sit closer to me, okay?

460
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,390
It isn't crowded.

461
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,420
Does your arm still hurt?

462
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,530
- Could I check your arm? 
 - No. It doesn't hurt at all.

463
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,690
In fact, the exercise sequelae are quite serious.

464
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,250
- You'd better let me check it for you. 
 - My arm has recovered.

465
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,550
- Really? 
 - Yes.

466
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,960
They begin. They begin. They begin.

467
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,840
   

468
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,570
They're driving so fast.

469
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,730
There's-There's corner overtaking.

470
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,360
Shumiao, come on.

471
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,240
Monitor, come on.

472
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,830
Go, go. What's wrong with her?

473
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,640
- How do you feel? 
 - So thrilling.

474
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,940
What's the matter?

475
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,070
What's wrong? Are you okay?

476
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,510
Let me help you.

477
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,840
Are you okay?

478
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,760
Do you feel a little dizzy?

479
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,870
How are you feeling? Are you dizzy?

480
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,100
How many years have you used this lighter?

481
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,770
- Why don't you walk slowly? 
 - I've used it for a long time.

482
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,370
Why not take a seat?

483
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,840
Sit down-Sit down quickly.

484
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,560
I'll get you water.

485
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,570
Are you all right?

486
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,470
What's wrong with you?

487
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,480
Here you are.

488
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,520
Don't drink this.

489
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,640
You'll feel even more uncomfortable after smelling it.

490
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,040
I'll buy you plain water.

491
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,010
- Do you have any facial tissues with you? 
 - No.

492
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,910
I'll buy some for you.

493
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,530
I'll also go.

494
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,170
Come on. Have some water.

495
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,070
Just spit it out.

496
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,320
Here comes the water. Here comes the water.

497
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,690
Don't you want to compete with me?

498
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,870
You're asking for trouble.

499
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,240
Li Xun, come on.

500
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,220
Li-Li Xun. He keeps driving before Jiang Xingchi.

501
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,910
Li Xun, come on.

502
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,690
 Monitor. Class Rep. Li Xun is so amazing. 

503
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,320
Thanks for sending me back.

504
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,910
You won. Why do you look unhappy?

505
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,230
Give back the coat to Jiang Xingchi and let him wash it himself.

506
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,900
It's improper. I stained his coat.

507
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,860
He happened to squat in front of you.

508
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,320
How dare he date the belle of our class?

509
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,700
Who is the belle?

510
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,610
Fang Shumiao.

511
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,860
I'll leave.

512
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,380
So stubborn.

513
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,390
- What's this? 
 - You won't have to go to volleyball class later.

514
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,250
Certificate of diagnosis.

515
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,140
I took sick leave notes for your exemption from sports and dancing courses at the university hospital,

516
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,510
so you don't need to go to volleyball class later.

517
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,250
Do you think I can't play volleyball well?

518
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,720
You really have no gift for sports.

519
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,900
Repeat it.

520
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,290
Well, God is fair.

521
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,260
You're tall, handsome, and talented.

522
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,670
Your figure is better than that of models.

523
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,630
Your IQ is higher than that of Einstein.

524
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,200
So it's normal for you to perform badly in sports.

525
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,350
Do you think I'm no match for him?

526
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,800
He's good at sports.

527
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,170
So we don't need to compete with him in sports.

528
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,800
It turns out this is the feeling of no matter how I study, I can't learn a class well.

529
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,950
I must go to volleyball class.

530
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,220
So stubborn.

531
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:42,640


532
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,090
   

533
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,170
 The school knows about the mark change. 

534
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,460
 Are you mad? 

535
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,590
 I thought if my score was higher, my dad would give me more pocket money. 

536
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,410
 Your mother needs money to stay in the hospital. 

537
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,570
 What are you busy with? 

538
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,100
 Does it have anything to do with you? 

539
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,820
 What's wrong? 

540
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,940
 Li Xun. Li Xun. 

541
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,840
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

542
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,000
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

543
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,600
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

544
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,320
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

545
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,800
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

546
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,840
♫  We will not separate  ♫

547
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,860
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

548
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,400
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

549
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,340
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

550
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:00,500
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

551
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,180
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

552
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,640
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

553
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,740
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

554
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,320
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

555
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,980
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

556
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,340
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

557
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,820
♫  That hot firework  ♫

558
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:45,320
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

559
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,180
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

560
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,800
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

561
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,200
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

562
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,780
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

563
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,920
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

564
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,400
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

565
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,720
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

566
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,320
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

567
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:36,780
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

568
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:41,480
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

569
