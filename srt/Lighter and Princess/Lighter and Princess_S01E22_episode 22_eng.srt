2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,400
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,420
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,700
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,530
   

21
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,940
   

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,820
   

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,810
   

24
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,410
   

25
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,120
Why didn't you answer my call?

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Even if I didn't answer my phone, couldn't you still find me?

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,750
Tell me. What are you up to tonight?

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,820
There's nothing to tell.

29
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,620
Don't you think you should explain yourself?

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,200
While I can still accept your apology.

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,080
Explain what?

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,870
There's no way.

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,270
I just can't stand people like you.

34
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,220
What kind of people are we?

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,450
Your mom is right.

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,790
People like us are scheming for profits and anxious to achieve quick success and get instant benefits.

37
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,350
And people like you are cold and heartless, looking superior.

38
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,170
You take studying abroad as a handout and always look superior to teach others a lesson.

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,700
So you deliberately stimulated them?

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,050
Yes.

41
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,930
In fact, I'm very happy to see them getting furious.

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,840
Because they were willing to let you go abroad with me and you wouldn't have to pay the tuition?

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,100
You made up those words to irritate them?

44
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,400
You don't care that they're my parents? This was your first official meeting.

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,490
You don't care how I face them in the future and whether they still accept us?

46
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,260
Do you think they will?

47
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,560
Even if I listen to them.

48
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,640
Then you can at least try.

49
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,510
You also proposed meeting them today.

50
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,060
Like today, I really doubt you.

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,850
What do you doubt?

52
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,720
Tell me what you doubt?

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,080
I doubt your intentions.

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,460
I just said what I would say later.

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,670
You will face this problem sooner or later.

56
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,950
Go home.

57
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,630
What do you mean?

58
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,200
It's what you understand.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,950
You made my parents so angry. Can I go home?

60
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,590
Otherwise?

61
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,350
You want to stay tonight?

62
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,710
Li Xun, I think it's not too much for me to ask you to apologize to me for what happened today. Right?

63
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,580
You can let me go. Then think it over.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,620
After I leave today, will I come back?

65
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,320
That's your choice.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,310
Okay. You said it.

67
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,650
   

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,240
   

69
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,990
So Li Xun quarreled with your mom

70
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,630
and then you quarreled with him?

71
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,720
Marvelous.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,360
He was quite strange today. You know.

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,900
But I can imagine how your mom reacted.

74
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,730
People like Li Xun were born to ruffle feathers.

75
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,840
Ms. Liu's high-toed manner must have forced him to show his true colors.

76
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,400
Besides, Li Lan just died.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,900
The hurdle in his heart must not have been passed yet.

78
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,340
You're helping him find a reason.

79
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,080
You know what? If he doesn't explain it to me today, I won't go back.

80
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,110
Then what happened to him?

81
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,930
There must be a reason for the abnormality.

82
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,770
Has he been hiding something from you recently?

83
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,470
 Zhu Yun, isn't Li Xun going to meet your parents at your home today? 

84
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,440
 He seems to be with Xu Lina. 

85
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,270
Where are you going?

86
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,370
You broke your words too fast.

87
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,150
 No, I still have to find a reason to ask him. 

88
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,740
   

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
I forgot something.

90
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,350
Take it.

91
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,300
Li Xun, we can talk if something happened to you. Right?

92
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,770
I was in a bad mood tonight. So I had a bad attitude.

93
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,600
But you were worse. I won't let this go so easily.

94
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,270
But I can forget about this now.

95
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,830
I just want to know. What did you do before you went to my home today?

96
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,370
Didn't you come back for the key?

97
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,800
Is this important?

98
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,360
Do you know the golden 24-hour principle?

99
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,420
If some misunderstandings are not resolved in time, they will lead to greater ones.

100
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,670
I think it's pretty irresponsible for me to speculate like this.

101
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:44,790
So can you tell me what you did and whom you met today?

102
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,540
Don't think I don't know. Fang Shumiao told me.

103
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,420
The bathroom in your company is quite far.

104
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,100
Why is she here?

105
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,470
Why can't I be here?

106
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,690
This is not a misunderstanding.

107
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,720
   

108
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,740
♪ Do you feel regret? ♪

109
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,780

114

You are awake.

115
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,490
What song is this?

116
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,270
A new song I'm writing.

117
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,340
I haven't decided on a name yet.

118
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,080
Cheer up. You'll make up in a few days.

119
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,780
After I finish this song, I'll give it to you as a graduation gift

120
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,610
and sing it to you on graduation day.

121
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,920
Hello. Hello.

122
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,160
 Hello, this is Xu Lina. I'm looking for Zhu Yun. 

123
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,880
Zhu Yun. For you.

124
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,400
I won't answer his call.

125
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,350
It's Xu Lina.

126
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,990
Hello.

127
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,590
 Zhu Yun, are you free? Let's meet. 

128
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,740
Zhu Yun, I've never liked you very much.

129
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,690
It doesn't matter. I don't like you either.

130
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,410
We are about to graduate. What's your plan?

131
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,380
It's none of your business.

132
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,230
My father set up a fund for me.

133
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,360
Recently, I've been running back and forth to several cities to investigate projects.

134
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,680
I prefer those at the conceptual stage,

135
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,710
so I can participate in them during incubation.

136
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,120
It will give me a sense of achievement and the rate of return will be high.

137
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,400
I heard one interesting business plan yesterday.

138
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,240
The slogan is to increase the cure rate of cancer by 1%.

139
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,740
I'm quite interested in this company.

140
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,720
L&amp;P, are you familiar with it?

141
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,540
So I asked you out today because of this.

142
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,800
I think highly of this company.

143
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,330
Since your parents don't have this vision, I'll invest in it.

144
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,630
But the condition is that,

145
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,290
you're out.

146
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,290
Then you can try.

147
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,100
If I don't agree, can you take it away?

148
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,260
It doesn't matter. Li Xun has promised me.

149
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,590
What did he agree with you?

150
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,770
Didn't he tell you?

151
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,780
It seems that you are really not important to him.

152
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,350
It's ridiculous if you are trying to test me with bluffing.

153
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,700
If you want to control Li Xun, that's even more impossible.

154
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,340
He won't accept you.

155
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,160
He's not under anyone's control.

156
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,860
Then you still don't know him well enough.

157
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:32,020
Have you considered how much time and cost must be paid to achieve that goal?

158
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,270
Internet technology development is much faster than you think.

159
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,530
As long as we can master the first-hand clinical data,

160
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,430
under the integration of big data, we'll see its value soon.

161
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,990
Where is the data?

162
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,490
We have mastered the diagnostic data of core departments of major hospitals.

163
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,430
China is too big.

164
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,840
You only made a few statistics and become arrogant?

165
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,550
There's still a long way to go.

166
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,660
I'm willing to do it.

167
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,610
You're willing?

168
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,320
Is he willing?

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,560
You are pathetic. You don't even know if someone sold you.

170
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,920
Li Xun told me personally he doesn't want to waste time

171
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,750
but to develop L&amp;P as soon as possible.

172
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,210
By the way, here is a tip.

173
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,840
We're on our way.

174
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,090
What are you up to?

175
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,720
Meet my dad.

176
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,020
- Let's go. 
 - Okay. Let's go.

177
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,460
Li Xun.

178
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,450
Wait for me in the car for a while.

179
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,860
Where are you going?

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,580
When are you going to tell me?

181
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,030
After coming back.

182
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,970
With Xu Lina?

183
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,320
She said you promised her. What did you promise her?

184
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,800
Shares.

185
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,610
It doesn't matter if it's Xu Lina or others.

186
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,400
Now, as long as someone is willing to invest in it,

187
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,320
I can promise to give up 50% of the shares.

188
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,840
That 50% you said belongs to me?

189
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,800
It used to be.

190
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,380
So before you met my parents, you'd decided it. Right?

191
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,750
No.

192
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,220
Since you asked for the shares back,

193
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,380
you'd decided to exclude me. Right?

194
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,950
Kind of.

195
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,810
What if I don't agree?

196
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,980
Legally speaking, you don't have this right now.

197
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,640
I don't have this right?

198
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,250
So you won't say one more word to me?

199
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,670
Have we reached this point?

200
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,280
Being emotional is a burden for everyone.

201
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,650
The two of us fighting alone might look heroic.

202
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,350
But if one day when we break up because of the problem of funds, you'll regret it.

203
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,390
What do you think of me?

204
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,580
I just don't want you to regret.

205
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,440
That is my business if I were to regret it later.

206
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,870
You have to go today, don't you?

207
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,030
Think about it twice. What exactly do you want?

208
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,950
Go home.

209
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,110
Don't let your parents worry.

210
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,530
Li Xun, if you take one more step forward today, we will break up.

211
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,030
What happened exactly?

212
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,180
Are you hiding something from me? What are you planning?

213
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,700
Nothing.

214
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,840
This is what I want.

215
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,600
♫  Memories lie  ♫

216
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:16,240
♫  Hope ends up being disappointed  ♫

217
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,720
♫  Hiding the dream privately  ♫

218

♫  And returning it to time with your bare hands  ♫

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,580
♫  There is nowhere to hide  ♫

♫  Looking back  ♫

223
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,800
♫  I want to give a little light  ♫

224
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,980
♫  To the extreme darkness  ♫

225

♫  Just like the shoulder you lent me back then  ♫

♫  Some things from the past can't be said aloud  ♫

What princess?

230
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,710
What hell?

231
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,680
All of it was fake.

232
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,800
♫  I have never gone against time  ♫

233

248
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,510
My dad works up there.

249
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,180
Are you sure you don't want me to go up and meet him?

250
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,410
Thanks this time.

251
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,120
I cooperated with you to tell such a big lie.

252
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,190
You owe me a favor.

253
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,240
I will repay you.

254
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,430
What are you going to repay me?

255
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,040
How about giving me a chance?

256
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,900
I know you won't accept my dad's help.

257
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,370
But I can work hard with you.

258
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,600
I can accompany you to start a business.

259
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,060
I'd made up my mind before I came here this time.

260
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,580
I can give up clothes and shoes, bags and cars.

261
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,490
- I can leave everything they give me behind. 
 - Xu Lina.

262
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,740
I haven't finished yet.

263
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,890
I can also accompany you to have box lunches and live in a small house.

264
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,990
I can do whatever she can do.

265
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,200
Am I worth a chance now?

266
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,020
I've made a lot of mistakes and I love to flaunt my superiority.

267
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,900
I have a sharp tongue.

268
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,810
You don't need me to give you a chance.

269
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,940
I'm not qualified to be arrogant.

270
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,670
You deserve a better man.

271
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,050
That's how I refuse others.

272
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,080
I'm leaving.

273
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,630
Li Xun.

274
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,090
Can I ask? You drove Zhu Yun away so hard this time,

275
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,470
what are you trying to do?

276
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,040
I always feel uneasy when you look like this.

277
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,820
Don't think too much.

278
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,140
I'm just annoying her.

279
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,940
That's it.

280
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,590
   

281
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,640
   

282
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,390
Does Zhu Yun know this?

283
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,900
I advise you better not tell her.

284
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,450
What you are holding now also has her shares.

285
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,480
It's this time and you're still in the mood to joke.

286
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,670
In the future, she'll learn about it.

287
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,210
She will come and ask me.

288
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,650
How should I answer her?

289
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,770
What will she think of me?

290
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,490
I'm not afraid.

291
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,590
What are you afraid of?

292
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,860
Of course, you don't have to be afraid.

293
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,970
You don't have to think about this. But I do.

294
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,100
You don't have to worry about her.

295
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,900
She will go abroad...

296
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,330
and leave here.

297
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,730
She doesn't need to pester everything.

298
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,390
But this company can only rely on you in the future.

299
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,250
I'll try my best.

300
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,840
Li Xun.

301
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,600
Thank you for trusting me.

302
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,150
Old Gao.

303
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,680
I have no family.

304
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,690
I don't have any friends.

305
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,210
You may hate me.

306
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,360
But you are the person I trust most.

307
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,110
I made you cancel the competition.

308
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,870
I have been very sorry.

309
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,460
This company can give you a place to stay.

310
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,350
I'm sure you will run it well as we said.

311
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:29,090
What are you going to do with Fang Zhijing?

312
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,530
I don't know.

313
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,790
I agree with you to teach him a lesson.

314
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,050
Scum like him should have been dealt with long ago.

315
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,870
But I don't think it's necessary if we want to use the method of killing each other.

316
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,140
I don't think it is necessary to kill a thousand enemies and lose eight hundred.

317
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,140
Is it worth it.

318
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,900
Not at all.

319
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,700
But something must be done.

320
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,280
Old Gao.

321
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,290
Tomorrow is the last day of the information security competition.

322
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,800
Yes. Tomorrow is the final award presentation.

323
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,150
   

324
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,030
How is it?

325
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,070
It's okay.

326
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:28,040
You don't know how hard it was for me to win the first prize this time.

327
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,760
You're mad at your mom?

328
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,300
Yun Yun, you're an adult.

329
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,160
Sometimes you have to learn to think in terms of others.

330
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,270
You have to figure out why your parents do this to you.

331
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,890
And for an outsider, you go against your parents like this.

332
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,040
Your mother and I have spared some time.

333
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,630
Let's go to Sanya to celebrate the Spring Festival this year.

334
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,650
 That bastard Fang Zhijing said that Li Lan asked him where there was a cheap hotel, 

335
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,890
 so he kindly introduced one to her. 

336
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:26,030
 I think he was just afraid you'd get in his way in the finals, 

337
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,190
 so he tricked Li Lan out of there to scare you. 

338
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,650
 Won't he come back for the finals? 

339
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,190
- Since high school…  
 - Dad, today is the 18th?

340
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,720
Today is the 18th?

341
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,610
Yeah. What's up?

342
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,280
Stop.

343
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,220
Yun Yun, where are you going?

344
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,360
Now I will read out the list of winners.

345
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,000
The team from Anhua University.

346
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,910
Team leader, Shao Bing.

347
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,230
The team from the University of Electronic Science and Technology.

348
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,630
The team from Information Engineering University.

349
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,640
The team from Hengjiang University of Posts and Telecommunications.

350
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,540
Team leader, Zhao Zijie.

351
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,920
Congratulations.

352
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:21,640
Finally, I announce the team that won first place is

353
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,750
the team from Information Technology University.

354
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,100
Team leader, Fang Zhijing.

355
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,920
Let's welcome the leaders of the organizing committee to present awards to them.

356
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,780
Let's welcome their team leader Fang Zhijing to deliver an acceptance speech.

357
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,370
Respected leaders and teachers, dear students, hello.

358
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,290
 Great. 

359
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:14,950
First of all, I would like to especially thank the teachers who led the team, the judges,

360
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,650
and teachers of organizing committee.

361
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,550
Thanks for your hard work.

362
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,010
Secondly, I also want to thank all the students who participated in the competition.

363
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,590
 Without your enthusiastic efforts, we would not have had such a spark of passion. 

364
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,730
Thank you all.

365
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,480
 - Great. 
 - Great. 

366
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:41,200
 I believe that in the future, the general trend of information security development 

367
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,620
 is a kind of big security from traditional security towards integration and openness. 

368
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,930
 With the continuous development of the internet, the traditional network boundary no longer exists. 

369
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,510
 Traditional security technology can no longer meet the needs of the new generation. 

370
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,900
 With the development of network security technology, 

371
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,880
 whether enterprises or individuals, 

372
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,460
 all will have changing demands for information security. 

373
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,020
 And these changes 

374
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,140
 will bring huge impact to the future internet applications and services 

375
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,520
 and it will also bring new challenges to information security. 

376
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,070
 But at the same time, it will also bring us new opportunities, 

377
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,750
 new data, new applications. 

378
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:30,970
 New, new applications, new computing, and new networks will become a new generation. 

379
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,550
Li Xun!

380
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,640
Stop. Stop now.

381
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,950
Guards! Where are the guards? Stop him.

382
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,410
What are you doing, Li Xun?

383
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,900
Pull him away! Pull him away.

384
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,140
Pull him away.

385
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
Leave now.

386
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,180
   

387
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,930
Yun.

388
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,560
You've been sleeping all day.

389
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,250
Would you like to eat something?

390
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,490
What are you looking for?

391
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,820
Dad, where's my cell phone?

392
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,970
I've taken it away.

393
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,870
Get some good rest at home these days.

394
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,870
Give me back my cell phone.

395
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,950
Yun Yun, you shout at me again.

396
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:05,220
Did I tell you earlier Li Xun would cause great trouble sooner or later?

397
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,500
Now you see it?

398
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,320
See what he did.

399
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,700
Wasn't it just a fight?

400
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,400
Just a punishment record. He can drop out of school.

401
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,550
He doesn't care anyway. What's the big deal?

402
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,270
What's the big deal?

403
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,890
Yes.

404
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,240
Fang Zhijing was rescued.

405
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,080
But his left eyeball was removed.

406
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:36,500
Hundreds of people on site watched him blinding another man.

407
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,070
That's horrible.

408
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,920
In my opinion, his sister died because of him.

409
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,270
For such people, that's an eye for an eye.

410
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,950
I beg your pardon?

411
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,160
I said it's an eye for an eye.

412
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
What's wrong?

413
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,560
Now this matter has widely spread.

414
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,050
Do you think the Fang family will spare him?

415
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:57,200
Their own child was blinded by him.

416
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,600
You see how people deal with him in the future.

417
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,840
Then I'll find him.

418
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,550
No need. He has been detained.

419
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,910
- You can't go anywhere. 
 - I'm going to meet him.

420
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,140
- You go abroad now. 
 - I won't go.

421
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,390
Mom, look at him.

422
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,620
Are you going to make it more troublesome, huh?

423
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:18,970
Zhu Yun! You're an adult now.

424
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,780
Why can't you tell right from wrong?

425
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,470
Is this a small matter?

426
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,140
Their child was blinded.

427
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,630
The rest of his life is over.

428
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,450
You're still backing that bastard?

429
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,860
What about Li Xun? Why don't you think about Li Xun's future?

430
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,020
What future does he have after he did such a thing?

431
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,210
Whether Fang Zhijing is blind or dead has nothing to do with me.

432
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,040
Don't hit her.

433
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,620
How can you say that?

434
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,990
Yun Yun...

435
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,360
You have now become someone we don't know.

436
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,720
No matter what Li Xun did today, I will definitely go and meet him.

437
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,770
Let me out.

438
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:44,120
 Defendant Li Xun, at about 1:30 p.m. 

439
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,970
 in the afternoon of January 18, 2016, in the No.1 Lecture Hall of Nanhu University, 

440
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,230
 beat the victim, 

441
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,750
 causing serious injury to the victim's face and eye. 

442
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,540
 According to forensic identification, 

443
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:07,100
 the victim suffered bilateral nasal bone and septum fractures and left eyeball enucleation. A serious injury. 

444
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,500
 The public prosecution agency believes that the defendant 

445
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,020
 deliberately injured others and caused serious injuries to others. 

446
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,510
 Thus behavior has violated the regulation of Article 234 

447
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:28,170
 of "Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China." 

448
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,840
Yun Yun, eat something.

449
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,500
 The defendant should take criminal responsibility 

450
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,680
 and we recommend a sentence of more than three years and up to 10 years in prison. 

451
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,990
 Defendant, do you have anything to say to the victim? 

452
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,700
 No. 

453
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,780
Doctor, how is she?

454
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,920
She is suffering from qi deficiency and congestive blockage.

455
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,800
She has signs of depression.

456
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,660
Nine out of ten people suffering from depression have a tendency of committing suicide.

457
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,370
You need to watch her this time.

458
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,010
Thank you.

459
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,740
Have you prepared everything for going abroad?

460
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,820
Yes.

461
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,950
She must leave this year.

462
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,170
She must leave.

463
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,170
Yun Yun,

464
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,170
you've been calm for so long.

465
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,160
Listen to me.

466
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:50,080
I've arranged everything for you to study abroad.

467
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,040
As long as you nod your head, we can leave anytime.

468
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,380
Listen to me.

469
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,470
Go out and relax.

470
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,520
Change your environment.

471
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,630
Maybe it'll be fine.

472
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,090
Yun Yun.

473
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,620
You don't eat or drink all day.

474
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,100
You torture yourself like this.

475
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,520
If you're determined to destroy yourself for that boy

476
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,580
and make your parents suffer for a lifetime,

477
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,770
we'll let you go.

478
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,500
It's up to you.

479
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,910
Dad.

480
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,400
Mom.

481
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,530
Can you promise me one thing?

482
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:24,420


483
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,120
   

484
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,070
 Gao, we will talk about work only later. 

485
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:35,070
 Do you need me to report work in such a place? 

486
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,120
 Now L&amp;P has nothing to do with you. 

487
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,880
 You have such an end because you asked for it.  You deserve it. 

488
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,680
 You occupied L&amp;P by making use of Li Xun's trust in you. 

489
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,920
 I came for Gao Jianhong. 

490
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,170
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

491
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,130
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

492
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:04,730
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

493
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:10,450
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

494
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,930
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

495
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:21,870
♫  We will not separate  ♫

496
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,990
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

497
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,530
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

498
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,570
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

499
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:41,530
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

500
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:49,310
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

501
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,670
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

502
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:58,170
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

503
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,350
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

504
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:07,110
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

505
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,470
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

506
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,950
♫  That hot firework  ♫

507
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:26,350
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

508
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,510
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

509
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,130
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

510
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,230
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

511
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,710
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

512
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:01,150
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

513
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,430
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

514
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,850
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

515
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,450
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

516
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:17,910
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

517
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,610
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

518
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:27,030
♫  True love will take its course ♫

519

♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

522

♫  True love will take its course  ♫

523
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:49,170
♫  That hot firework  ♫

524
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:59,810
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫
