2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,600
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,460
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,120
   

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,420
Where is Li Xun?

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,120
Who are you?

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,530
Let go.

25
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,930
I'll wait for you over there.

26
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,390
Be careful. She's strong.

27
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,360
When did you get out?

28
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,080
What's your next plan?

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,990
It has nothing to do with you.

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,020
Where do you live?

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,150
Did you come back to get married?

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,640
You two are a perfect match.

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,790
Do you know what you are saying?

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,690
Zhu Yun, what I have gone through has nothing to do with you.

35
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,050
And you don't need to feel sorry.

36
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,820
I made it clear three years ago.

37
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,210
Who you are going to be with

38
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,810
has nothing to do with me.

39
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,940
Do you understand?

40
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,220
Li Xun,

41
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,180
what did I do?

42
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,170
Why are you treating me like this?

43
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,440
I just thought you were heartless before.

44
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,700
Now I finally realize that you are really a jerk.

45
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,570
You think too much.

46
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,010
Time is precious for everyone.

47
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm going.

48
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,580
Li Xun, you haven't changed at all.

49
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,890
Sorry, buddy.

50
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,370
Bye.

51
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,600
Li Xun, is that girl the one you mentioned in jail?

52
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,570
She's beautiful but too fierce.

53
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,610
Did she ever practice Taekwondo?

54
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,080
- Why don't you talk? Are you afraid... 
 -  Shut up.

55
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,470
Okay.

56
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,680
Women are unreliable.

57
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,460
Zhu Yun, where do you want to go in such a rush?

58
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,660
Aren't we going back to the hotel?

59
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,670
But I have to tell you that it's about 10 km away.

60
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,870
How about this? It's hard to walk with your heels on.

61
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's call a taxi to go back to the hotel.

62
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,350
If you really want to take a walk, change your shoes and I'll go with you.

63
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,370
Okay.

64
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,810
   

65
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,950
That female star is generous.

66
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,760
Dollar. A surprise.

67
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,870
 Sorry, buddy. 

68
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,520
You should change your bad habit,

69
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,900
or you'll be looked down upon.

70
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,260
- Return the purse. 
 - Okay.

71
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,320
What's this?

72
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,450
How strange. She even puts her keys in her purse.

73
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,450
Zhu Yun.

74
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,870
I saw how you reacted when you saw him yesterday.

75
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,180
I can't pretend that I don't know anything.

76
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,180
He's still in your heart.

77
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,730
No, you're wrong.

78
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,610
I don't want to compare myself with him.

79
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,480
You two are too different.

80
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,370
You are better than him.

81
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,410
Actually, come to think of it, he's pretty much an asshole most of the time.

82
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,800
It has been three years.

83
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,140
When I went abroad, I couldn't even hear his name.

84
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,540
I felt sad at the thought of him.

85
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,280
So I studied as hard as I could,

86
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,280
trying to do all kinds of things so that I couldn't stop.

87
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,600
I thought when I used up my energy,

88
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,240
I wouldn't feel sad.

89
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,110
But gradually, I found that I was no longer constantly crying...

90
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,500
or was unable to fall asleep the whole night.

91
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,320
In fact, I didn't do anything special.

92
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,880
I was just living an ordinary life.

93
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
Do you still hate him?

94
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,280
This house is newly decorated.

95
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,670
It has good lighting, right?

96
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,900
Okay. We'll rent this house.

97
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,350
Really?

98
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,310
Let's sign a contract. Let's make it a three-month lease.

99
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,270
What do you do?

100
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,920
It has nothing to do with you.

101
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,300
I need to know who is renting my house.

102
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,610
Our job is related to computers. We're programmers.

103
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,410
Programmers?

104
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,880
You don't look like programmers.

105
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,280
What do you think we do?

106
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,320
I just can't rent my house to someone with an unclear identity.

107
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,640
- Let's go. 
 - We have a clear identity.

108
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,710
What... How strange they are.

109
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,990
What do you want to do?

110
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,110
Aren't you curious what we do?

111
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,200
He's a murderer and I split the body for him.

112
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,180
We were just released from prison.

113
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,610
What else do you want to know?

114
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,560
Do you know what kind of person you introduced to me?

115
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,940
They're strange persons.

116
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,490
I'm telling you, do not introduce such persons to me again.

117
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,390
It's the 7th one.

118
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,110
Like I said, they are the same.

119
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,670
When I was just released from prison, I also wanted to live a normal life.

120
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,280
But, as you saw, we're abandoned by society as we were put in jail.

121
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,610
No one sees us as normal people.

122
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,190
How about this? You go abroad with me.

123
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,210
The weather is good abroad, and no one knows us.

124
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,220
And we won't be treated unfairly there.

125
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,560
You're not over your ex-girlfriend, are you?

126
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,240
Hou Ning, you can leave.

127
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,060
But as long as you work with me, I can let you be a dignified person.

128
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,160
Make a choice.

129
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,680
Don't change the subject.

130
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,320
Stop!

131
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,330
All kinds of people are living in the neighborhood.

132
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,820
Mind your own business and don't make trouble.

133
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,300
Pay the rent on the 20th day of every month.

134
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,590
You have the card number.

135
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,570
Remember to pay the rent on time.

136
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,540
Here is the key.

137
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,830
I'm going. Call me if you need help.

138
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,390
Come on. Do we rent such a small house with so much money?

139
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,060
You can rent one by yourself if you don't want to live here.

140
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,280
Clean it up. I'm going out.

141
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,400
Do I clean it up alone?

142
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,450
You're the boss.

143
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,820
Here.

144
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,880
Miss Ren, which one would you like to wear?

145
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,170
This one.

146
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,790
You go over first. Okay.

147
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,840
Who sent it here?

148
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,910
Who else can it be?

149
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,310
Where is he?

150
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,320
He sent it to me by express.

151
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,280
What? Did you lose anything?

152
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,210
An old object. It should have been lost a long time ago.

153
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,030
Are you leaving?

154
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,590
We've handled everything. We're going back to Linyang tomorrow.

155
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,810
With Tian Xiuzhu?

156
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,580
It's good.

157
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,560
Just take it as a less satisfactory ending to the story.

158
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,110
I'm going to work.

159
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,990
- Go. 
 - Bye-bye.

160
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,210
 Does it look good? 

161
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,350
 Okay, okay, okay. I'll comb it for you. 

162
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,180
 Have a look and give me some advice. 

163
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,010
 What do you think of it, Li Xun? 

164
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,870
 I think this part is fine. 

165
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,880
 This part can be improved. 

166
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,640
 I think it's fine. 

167
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:01,340
   

168
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:25,080
   

169
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,690
 - No... But he is just gifted. 
 - Is he? 

170
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,550
 Is he gifted? 

171
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,310
   

172
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,900
 - You misunderstood. 
 - Say that again. 

173
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,020
   
 - You misunderstood. 
 - Say it. 

174
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,210
 You misunderstood. Really. 

175
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,410
 So what do you mean? 

176
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,500
♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

177
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,040
♫  And have passed through the dark night  ♫

178
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,160
♫  In the crowd in the dim light  ♫

179
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,640
♫  You're over there with the fireworks  ♫

180
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,100
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

181
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,120
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

182
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,980
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

183
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,980
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

184
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,580
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

185
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,960
♫  True love will take its course ♫

186
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,830
 Are you going? 

187
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,900
 - Lock the door. 
 - So I can come here freely in the future. 

188
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,840
♫  True love will take its course ♫

189
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,280
♫  That hot firework  ♫

190
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:04,240
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

191
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,000
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

192
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
♫  True love will take its course ♫

193
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,580
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

194
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,180
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

195
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,720
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

196
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,140
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

197
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,640
♫  That hot firework  ♫

198
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:10,820
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

199
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,400
♫  That hot firework  ♫

200
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:30,600
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

201
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,780
   

202
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,310
 Why does it take so long to distribute the textbooks? 

203
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,520
 - It's too slow.  
 - Yeah.  
 - Yeah. 

204
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,280
 Are they really going to distribute the textbooks? We'll suffer sunstroke. 

205
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,680
Guys, please be patient.

206
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,520
The seniors are counting inside.

207
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,750
It'll be our turn soon. Please be patient, okay?

208
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,070
Fang Shumiao, you're the acting monitor.

209
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,300
Go and urge them.

210
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,150
Yeah. We're new students. We'd better not leave a bad impression on the seniors.

211
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,470
Please be patient. It'll be our turn soon.

212
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,920
Thank you. Thank you.

213
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,580
Even so, you should also care about us. We've been exposed under the sun for an hour.

214
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,740
- Please be patient, okay? It'll be our turn soon. 
 - Hold on. Hold on.

215
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,750
Hold on. Hold on.

216
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,920
Come on. Move forward, Move forward.

217
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,970
Watch out. Watch out. Please make way. Please make way.

218
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,290
Why are you so late?

219
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,690
I am very fast actually.

220
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,990
Come on. Give me the water.

221
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,730
Go. Go, go.

222
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,930
Sorry. Please make way. Please make way.

223
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,550
Have some water. Have some water. Have some water.

224
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm treating you to water.

225
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,190
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 

226
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,790
 Give me a bottle. 

227
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,840
It's okay. Be careful. You all can have a bottle.

228
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,590
Here you are. Here you are. Who doesn't have one? Who doesn't have one?

229
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,920
You... Didn't you keep one bottle for yourself?

230
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,390
Did you give me the chance?

231
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,970
Come on. It's just spring water.

232
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,100
I'll give you a bucket of it.

233
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,750
You can drink mine.

234
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,060
What about you?

235
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,390
I drank some water when I came.

236
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,510
Thanks.

237
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,380
Wait!

238
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,050
Give me the water.

239
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,980
- Zhu Yun, go. 
 - What?

240
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,260
Hello, Senior.

241
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,310
Which class are you in? Wait outside.

242
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,600
Well, Senior. It's too hot.

243
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,430
I want to send you some water.

244
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,100
Have some water.

245
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,850
Thank you, Senior.

246
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,820
Which class are you from?

247
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,870
Applied Technology Class 1.

248
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,900
Where did you go?

249
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,250
Monitor took me to do something bad.

250
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,500
Nonsense.

251
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,380
Old Gao, are all the boys here?

252
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,060
Don't cause any trouble later.

253
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,270
One is not here.

254
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,350
Who?

255
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,060
Is it Li Xun again?

256
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,250
Who else can it be?

257
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,530
Who is Li Xun?

258
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,920
He didn't appear at the class meeting or go to the dormitory.

259
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,180
Does he have some illness?

260
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,730
You all haven't seen him?

261
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,660
Nope.

262
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,280
 Applied Technology Class 1. 

263
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,590
 - Our class. 
 - Our class. 

264
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,100
Okay. Now I'll call your names one by one by the student number.

265
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,860
When you hear your name, you'll go inside to take the textbooks.

266
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,050
Please keep absolutely silent. Can you do it?

267
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,120
Yes.

268
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,280
No. 1, Li Xun.

269
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,520
Isn't Li Xun here?

270
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,390
Is Li Xun here?

271
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,970
 You're quite handsome, buddy. 

272
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,100
 Where did he get his hair dyed? 

273
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,450
Li Xun.

274
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,750
Here.

275
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,860
Are you Li Xun?

276
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,530
Go.

277
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,180
He is so...

278
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,320
Arrogant.

279
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,180
To be honest, I don't know whether it's our good luck or bad luck to have such a strange classmate.

280
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,980
You're just an acting monitor. Don't worry so much.

281
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,850
After the class leadership election tomorrow, I will become the formal monitor.

282
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,450
I guess no one is interested in being the monitor besides you.

283
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,580
It's not an interest.

284
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,300
It's the glorious mission to serve the whole class devotedly.

285
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,020
I learned it.

286
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,370
What?

287
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,710
Only you can describe empleomania as a great honor.

288
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,940
   

289
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,270
Is Ren Di doing music again?

290
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,490
I guess so.

291
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,090
She didn't go and get her textbooks,

292
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,630
and we have to bring them back for her.

293
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,660
We're roommates. It's okay.

294
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,770
I feel so tired with my arms and legs.

295
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,850
I love air conditioning.

296
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,770
Ren Di.

297
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,160
Here are your textbooks.

298
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,700
Thank you.

299
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,730
What do we eat for dinner?

300
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,020
Whatever.

301
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,520
Be specific.

302
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,900
Whatever is the most difficult.

303
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,100
Do you need to turn to the admission handbook for this?

304
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,060
Take a break, curve wrecker.

305
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,550
The fun of college lies in exploration.

306
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,780
How about we start from the snack street at the back gate?

307
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,180
We'd better eat in the canteen.

308
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,660
The handbook says the canteen is the most important experience of college life.

309
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,760
Broccoli, tenderloin, and drumstick.

310
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,220
Here you are.

311
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,070
Where's your food?

312
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,310
I ordered a portion of malatang.

313
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,970
More than 20 persons are waiting in line before me.

314
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,310
I can't get my food for the moment.

315
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,380
Where do we sit?

316
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,870
There are seats over there. Go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick.

317
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,260
I swear that I only played games with my good friends yesterday.

318
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,680
- What? 
 - Wait.

319
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,560
- You played games for a whole night? 
 - Don't go.

320
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,720
Don't you believe me? I can call them all here.

321
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,550
I don't believe you.

322
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,040
I...

323
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,700
- Wait. 
 - Come on. Sit here. Sit here.

324
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,120
How did you know they were leaving?

325
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,010
When I came in the canteen, I noticed that they were quarreling.

326
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,470
So, we need to learn to observe life.

327
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,370
You are right.

328
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,490
Would you like some soup? I'm going to get a bowl of it.

329
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,490
I'll have soup with malatang.

330
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,230
Hello, Miss Zhang.

331
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm not busy. What's the matter?

332
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,350
Okay. Okay, okay.

333
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,820
Okay.

334
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,440
Hey, this seat is taken.

335
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,150
This seat is taken by Fang Shumiao.

336
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,870
Fang Shumiao, the acting monitor of our class. Do you know?

337
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,110
How does it taste?

338
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,770
Not bad.

339
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,980
If you want to sit here, I can take the seat for you.

340
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,490
Go on.

341
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,520
- Well, you can sit there. 
 - Li Xun?

342
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,010
Zhu Yun, whose meal is this?

343
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,010
Mine.

344
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,420
Thinking it was too cold here, I put your meal over there.

345
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,040
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,480
We picked the same dishes.

347
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,660
How about you have mine?

348
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,860
Or do you want to have something else? My treat.

349
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,490
I just went out to answer a phone call.

350
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,760
I didn't expect you would make such a mistake.

351
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,970
Stop laughing.

352
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,210
I'm not laughing.

353
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,490
I mean what I say. The water is for you.

354
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,490
Be slow. Don't choke yourself.

355
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,420
He's really unreasonable.

356
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,220
We're classmates, and it's normal that we treat each other to a meal.

357
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,620
Or I can give the meal expense back to him.

358
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,530
Fang Shumiao!

359
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,050
Li Xun. Li Xun?

360
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,050
It's me, Gao Jianhong.

361
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,520
They call me Old Gao.

362
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
I am also in Applied Technology Class 1.

363
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,540
You and I live next door.

364
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,530
I'm living in Room 205.

365
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,280
Li Xun, the student numbers of our school are based on our admission scores.

366
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,130
I'm No. 2, and you're No. 1.

367
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,720
I was ranked sixth in the province.

368
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,520
What about you?

369
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,840
Li Xun? Let's chat.

370
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,420
Li Xun?

371
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,420
Well, you go on showering.

372
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,550
I'll wait for you to go back together.

373
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,390
I'll wait for you.

374
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,940
Take a shower.

375
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,010
It took you so long.

376
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,280
I see that you like programming. I like it, too.

377
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,770
I liked playing computer when I was in junior high school.

378
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,680
I joined the school's coding society when I was in high school.

379
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,190
We can communicate in the future.

380
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,920
You don't seem to talk much.

381
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,290
Programming develops so fast now.

382
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,550
Computer programming and hypertext preprocessor are complicated.

383
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,650
In my opinion, no matter how good a person is, it's hard for him to master so many languages.

384
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,690
So I decided to set up a programming interest group for mutual learning and exchange

385
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,910
to learn from others' strong points to make up for our deficiencies and make progress together.

386
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,890
Are you interested in it?

387
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,290
No.

388
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,660
Li Xun, please give us a chance to learn from you.

389
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,960
To learn from others' strong points to make up for our deficiencies is the most efficient way to learn.

390
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,320
Do I have deficiencies?

391
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,180
Hello?

392
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,540
At the hospital?

393
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,880
So serious? Wait. I'll be right there.

394
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,460
Li Xun, my friend's parents have come.

395
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,300
He asked me to book a room in the hotel at the south gate of our school.

396
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,100
Room 312. I'll ask him to take the room card from you later.

397
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,080
My good friend suffers from acute gastroenteritis. I need to see him at the hospital.

398
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,460
I'm giving the room card to you.

399
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,750
Remember to give it to him.

400
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,480
Gao Jianhong.

401
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,670
   

402
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,320
Li Xun.

403
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,070
It's for you. Money.

404
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,110
It's you?

405
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,430
Room 312 at the south gate.

406
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,340
What's this?

407
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,010
Look at it.

408
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,480
Did he give you the room card?

409
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,020
Is Li Xun so active?

410
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,510
You're good, Zhu Yun.

411
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,240
What a strange attitude you have!

412
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,140
Yes, you need to show your attitude.

413
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,440
He dated you directly. That's indecent.

414
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,910
Come on. We're adults. It's acceptable.

415
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,780
What else did he say to you?

416
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,110
He only said Room 312.

417
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,430
Do you think the New Student Handbook will tell you everything about your life?

418
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,220
I'm checking the map.

419
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,600
What to do when asked out by a boy at the start of school?

420
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,880
There is indeed a hotel outside our school.

421
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,000
You are exposed. You want to go, right?

422
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,270
Take it, take it, take it.

423
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,430
Take it away.

424
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,420
It doesn't matter. It's your trophy.

425
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,400
Yeah.

426
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,900
In our grade...

427
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,130
No, among all freshmen, you're the first one.

428
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,830
Show me your hand.

429
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,290
What?

430
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,670
Right hand.

431
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,450
I need to see your love line.

432
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,170
I'm going to tattoo one.

433
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,760
You are so dirty.

434
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,030
Wu Mengxing.

435
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,200
You know my name.

436
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,310
- From Jiangxi. 
 - Yes.

437
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:16,290
My hometown is Baihugou Village, Yanglin Town, Taihe County, Ji'an City. And I have a sister.

438
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,990
Okay. I know you.

439
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,270
I don't like to be disturbed when I'm writing codes.

440
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,210
Sorry.

441
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,390
- Well... 
 - Anything else?

442
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:35,620
Zhu Yun in our class asked me to give this to you.

443
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,860
And she has a message. Please be self-dignified.

444
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,650
Why didn't you urge me?

445
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,260
Come on. You are too picky about your dress.

446
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,430
Are you going to take part in the class leadership election or have a blind date?

447
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,920
We're almost 10 minutes late.

448
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,140
If I can't be elected as the monitor because I'm late, all my previous efforts will be in vain.

449
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,420
You will become the monitor.

450
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,180
Fang Shumiao, you are even late for the class leadership election.

451
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,780
Don't you want to be the monitor?

452
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,010
I'm sorry, Miss Zhang.

453
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,240
She overslept from her nap.

454
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,220
Take a seat.

455
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,820
Sit here.

456
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,390
- Move. 
 - What?

457
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,580
- Move. 
 - Sit down.

458
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,710
Sit down.

459
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,870
Miss Zhang is angry.

460
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,890
Now the meeting begins.

461
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,420
The main purpose of the meeting today is the class leadership election.

462
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,250
But before the election, I'd like to introduce a student to you.

463
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,080
He didn't attend military training because he was ill.

464
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,010
Student Li Xun, introduce yourself.

465
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,920
Student Li Xun?

466
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,570
My name is Li Xun.

467
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,640
I was first place in this year's college entrance examination.

468
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,220
You may not know.

469
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,740
Li Xun is the top scorer in science in our province.

470
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,080
 It's him. 

471
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,370
 All examinees in the province lost to this eccentric guy. 

472
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,930
He chose this major

473
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:51,340
and it fully shows that this major

474
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,490
has great industry prospects.

475
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,000
I hope you can cherish this opportunity

476
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,440
and study hard to become people who are useful to society.

477
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,910
Okay.

478
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,300
Next, let's start the class leadership election.

479
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,970
 Fang Shumiao. Fang Shumiao. 

480
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,920
Wang Ting.

481
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,350
Fang Shumiao.

482
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,290
Congratulations to Fang Shumiao.

483
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:24,420
She has officially become the monitor of Applied Technology Class 1.

484
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,370
Trust me, Miss Zhang and my dear classmates.

485
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:38,640
I will work harder to complete the tasks from the department and provide good services for you all.

486
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,830
 - Okay. 
 - Okay, okay. 

487
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,970
Fang Shumiao, change the blackboard.

488
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,350
Okay.

489
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,160
 Next, we'll select the commissary in charge of studies. 

490
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,310
 If the cadre group of a class is compared to 

491
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,200
 the four characters in the Journey to the West. 

492
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,170
 The monitor would be Tang Sanzang, 

493
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,310
and the commissary in charge of studies would be Sun Wukong,

494
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,780
and the student in charge of general affairs would be Monk Sha.

495
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,220
Which class cadre is Zhu Bajie?

496
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,140
Miss Zhang asked you to introduce yourself.

497
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,390
- Introduce yourself. 
 - Zhu Bajie...

498
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,950
Zhu Yun. My name is Zhu Yun.

499
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,570
I graduated from Linyang No. 1 High School.

500
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,730
Zhu Yun, are you recommending yourself?

501
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,870
Yes. You can't be late tomorrow.

502
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,250
- So strict. 
 - Of course.

503
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,550
Or my credits will be deducted.

504
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,340
The top scorer in our class is unique even in the whole country.

505
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,330
Anyway, I've never heard of a top scorer to have golden hair.

506
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,700
And he seems to be hard to get along with.

507
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,980
It's not a big deal.

508
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,530
Zhu Bajie is surnamed Zhu.

509
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,490
Your surname is Zhu as well.

510
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,040
Stop looking.

511
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,090
If you keep looking at him, he'll come into your dream.

512
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,440
If so, that will be a nightmare.

513
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,640
Go.

514
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,590
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

515
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,090
Two people are absent.

516
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,970
Ren Di didn't come back last night.

517
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,830
The school just began. She really doesn't obey the rules.

518
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,280
Where's Li Xun?

519
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,340
Why doesn't he come?

520
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,260
He left right after he got up this morning.

521
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,620
I thought he was going to class.

522
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,760
It's five minutes to seven. Why haven't they come?

523
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,810
From my understanding, Li Xun won't attend the morning self-study.

524
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,140
He must attend it.

525
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,630
Members from the student union will come to call the roll later.

526
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,770
Our class points will be deducted for absence from morning self-study.

527
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,820
I need to call him.

528
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,740
No answer.

529
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,440
He doesn't reply to me on WeChat .

530
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,670
It's normal.

531
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,080
I sent him a lot of messages, and he never replied.

532
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,600
He didn't reply to me either.

533
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,090
I need to make every possible effort.

534
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,820
He replied!

535
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,340
What did he say?

536
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,820
   
  It's none of your business. 

537
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,290
How can he be so rude?

538
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,150
It's good enough. He sent a reply to you.

539
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,390
Are you going to send another message?

540
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,870
I think he needs to be saved.

541
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,360
 Our class points will be deducted for absence from morning self-study. 

542
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,870
 Come to the class. 

543
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,870
 - It's not my problem. 
 - "It's not my problem"? 

544
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,090
It's not your problem. It's not my problem.

545
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:15,250
Li Xun sounds like a philosopher when he says these two words.

546
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,340
He even block...

547
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,210
No way. Someone!

548
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,920
- Give me your phone. 
 - He didn't add me on WeChat.

549
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,890
Old Gao.

550
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,820
Li Xun doesn't reply to Old Gao either.

551
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,370
He doesn't reply to anyone of us.

552
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,880
He's not a normal person.

553
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,430
Is he coming to the class for morning self-study or not?

554
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,240
I think it's a bit too late.

555
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,340
Hello, Seniors.

556
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,320
Is everyone here?

557
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm going to start the roll call.

558
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,840
I hope you freshmen will observe the school rules

559
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,670
and protect the class's collective honor.

560
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,490
Li Xun.

561
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,220
   

562
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,620
Li Xun is No. 1, and Ren Di is No. 2.

563
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,740
- What are you doing? 
 - Choose one.

564
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,880
These two people didn't attend morning self-study.

565
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,940
You and I will each be responsible for one of them.

566
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,060
Why should I make a choice? I'm not the monitor. I don't need to be responsible.

567
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,320
It's an urgent task.

568
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,290
I'll treat you to Adao Barbecue.

569
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,350
Or chunweizhai, though it's expensive.

570
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,990
No.

571
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,570
Do you want to have tanggong?

572
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,240
Since you won't make a choice, I'll do it. I choose the left one.

573
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,730
It's Ren Di.

574
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,490
I'll be responsible for urging Ren Di to attend morning self-study.

575
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,610
You'll be responsible for urging Li Xun to attend morning self-study.

576
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,120
Seniors said that double points will be deducted for absence in the future.

577
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,270
Four points a day.

578
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,480
It's not my problem.

579
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,640
Don't you want to contact Li Xun more to erase the misunderstanding between you?

580
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,700
It's not my problem.

581
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,590
Can you bear to watch me losing the national prize, the scholarship,

582
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,940
and the place for postgraduate recommendation?

583
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:59,110
No way. I'll never speak to him again.

584
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:07,800


585
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,780
   

586
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,340
 You appear to be a programming expert who types codes on your computer every day. 

587
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,500
 What if you're just a pretty face? 

588
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,220
 - What's homework? 
 - Coming. Coming. 

589
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,640
   
 This seems to be a virus. 

590
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,360
 Li Xun is really a genius. 

591
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,920
 - Will you do it or not? 
 - You should study hard 

592
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,140
 as you're worse than me. 

593
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,440
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

594
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,600
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

595
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:48,240
