1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:16,000


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,700
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,660
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,720
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,700
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,040
   

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,850
Did so many people join the base?

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,430
I joined it.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,390
You even copied Zhu Yun's homework.

25
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,820
Why did you join it?

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,540
In order to copy Li Xun's homework.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,570
So the base is not so good.

28
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,040
Li Xun set up the base to start up a business.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,510
He undertakes projects outside school.

30
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,520
He also raised funds by himself.

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,580
After making money, our school can get a share.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,940
He even started to make money by taking on projects?

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,880
Is he so capable?

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,890
So what?

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,220
We go to university to learn.

36
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,950
We can make money at any time.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,780
He will regret it if he can't get a job or be recommended for postgraduate education

38
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,760
as he won't get enough credits.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,820
The practice points he gets by one project are more than those you get by serving as a monitor.

40
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,300
Fang Shumiao, what are we eating later?

41
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,740
Where is she?

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,200
   

43
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,050
Well, you can do your own things now.

44
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,750
I will tell you in private if there's anything else.

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,720
Class rep is also here.

46
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,800
Who do you bring breakfast for?

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Did you hand in your homework? Don't be gossipy.

48
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,410
I've had breakfast. Give it to Old Gao.

49
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,030
Where's Old Gao?

50
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,670
Old Gao is angry.

51
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,570
As far as I know, the department has not approved the use of the classroom for your base.

52
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,200
It has been approved.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,160
Class rep, can you get the application form back for me?

54
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,500
There are so many classrooms. Do you have to share the classroom with us?

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,110
We're not sharing it.

56
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,390
As it says on the plate on the door, this is the classroom for the base.

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,200
This is the classroom for the interest group.

58
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,810
Yun, I...

59
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm not in yet.

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,330
I just came here to have a look.

61
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,100
Fang Shumiao.

62
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,920
We're classmates.

63
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,500
If your interest group isn't dismissed yet and you don't have a place to stay,

64
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,760
you can do your own things here.

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,140
Thanks.

66
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,340
Class rep, why did you only buy breakfast for Li Xun?

67
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,860
- Where's mine? 
 - Shut up!

68
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,800
The interest group is dismissed.

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,460
You can leave.

70
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,960
Anyway, I forced you to join it at the beginning.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,810
That base is indeed more useful than the interest group.

72
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,000
Old Gao, why did you set up the interest group?

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,210
No special reason. I just wanted to learn more things.

74
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,370
Then, why do you dismiss it?

75
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,890
Members of the base do their things, and we do our own things there.

76
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,930
Most members of the interest group have joined the base. Even Fang Shumiao has joined it.

77
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,730
That's such a huge humiliation.

78
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,860
I can't bear to lose face.

79
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,210
How about we make a bet?

80
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,180
If I make the goal, we'll stay, even if we're the only ones left.

81
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,430
Do you even believe this?

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,210
You were among top 10 in the college entrance examination.

83
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,600
I got 142 points in math.

84
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,080
It's just C language.

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,310
We're not worse than others. So we're not worse than Li Xun.

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,540
I've heard something before.

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,670
Coin tossing is not to let the coin make the decision for you.

88
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,430
When you toss, you already have an answer in your heart.

89
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,060
I will stay anyway.

90
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,790
What about you?

91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,060
   

92
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,940
   

93
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,670
Those who don't have a form can get one here from me.

94
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,610
Hand them out.

95
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,870
 Wait, wait, wait! 

96
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,650
 I... I will call over the names. 

97
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,330
Liu... Liu Sisi.

98
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,560
I'm here.

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,320
   

100
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,870
Zhu Liye.

101
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,170
- Zhu Liye. 
 - I'm here.

102
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,000
   

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,610
Deng... Deng...

104
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,100
Deng Tu?

105
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,440
It's Deng Yao. I'm here.

106
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,840
   

107
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,610
Sorry. Sorry. Deng, Deng Yao.

108
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,900
Is this an interview?

109
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,200
Yes, an interview focusing on looks.

110
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,140
Zhu Yun, it often flashes back. Have a look.

111
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,490
The logic of this line is not right.

112
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
- Right? 
 - It seems it's wrong. 
 - Take-out.

113
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,310
Whose milk tea?

114
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,060
Mine. Mine. Thanks.

115
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,370
It's okay.

116
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,040
Li Xun, I ordered the hot milk tea for you.

117
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,720
Remember to drink it.

118
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,610
- Okay. 
 - Hello. Who ordered the burger set meal?

119
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,950
Me. Thanks.

120
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,630
I ordered the burger set meal for you.

121
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,660
Enjoy it while it's hot.

122
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,880
- Hello. Who ordered the hot pot? 
 - Here.

123
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,760
Your base has seriously affected our interest group.

124
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
Who affected you?

125
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,160
This classroom is for our base.

126
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,840
Are you angry at them?

127
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,770
Can you talk nicely? Don't be unreasonable and change the concept in disguise.

128
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,480
Class rep. Yeah, talk nicely.

129
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,680
Don't be angry.

130
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,990
Who doesn't talk nicely?

131
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,710
Forget it. I didn't say anything.

132
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,070
 Hello, dear. 

133
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,760
 I'd like to share with you an electric toothbrush I've been using. 

134
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,650
 It has two colors, for him and for her. 

135
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,460
 One is marble white and the other is marble black. 

136
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,710
 If you want a confident smile, you need to take care of your teeth like you take care of your skin. 

137
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,300
 This electric toothbrush of marble colors... 

138
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,550
When did this pimple grow?

139
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,140
 You can share it with the one you like. 

140
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,020
So annoying.

141
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,280
- You're back. 
 -This is the electric toothbrush you bought.

142
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
Open it.

143
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,830
Yun Yun, look.

144
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,960
Isn't this a nice toothbrush?

145
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,560
It indeed looks nice.

146
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,740
Yun Yun, you have no idea.

147
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,540
Our classroom is really noisy.

148
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,860
Those girls are really pretentious.

149
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,760
I saw in person that when Li Xun sniffed,

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,380
a girl immediately bought an electric heater on Taobao for him.

151
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,580
The classroom is so noisy.

152
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,440
How can we focus on our project?

153
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,090
Obviously, those girls have other motives.

154
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,840
But Li Xun just let them do so.

155
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,120
So annoying.

156
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,060
Then you can choose not to go there.

157
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,590
Yun Yun, you have no idea how unreasonable our school's student union is.

158
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,590
Each member can get 20 points in one semester for all efforts they have made.

159
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,420
I just want to appear frequently before leaders so that I can get postgraduate recommendations easily.

160
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,750
Otherwise, I wouldn't go there.

161
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,130
So you're enduring present hardships to revive.

162
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,830
I feel hungry suddenly.

163
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,090
How about we go to have barbecue?

164
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,070
How about Da Dong Bei?

165
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,530
I don't want to go. I have excessive internal heat.

166
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,440
Those girls in the base have fair skin.

167
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,380
I have a pimple on my face.

168
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,980
You need some real skills to be a beauty.

169
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,090
It makes sense.

170
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,650
I'll have some papaya.

171
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,740
Did you ever learn biology?

172
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,310
The well-fed don't know how the starving suffer.

173
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,560
If I am sincere enough, I believe I can succeed.

174
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,980
Ren Di is also here.

175
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,140
Hello.

176
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,430
I have something to show you.

177
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,960
Get a chair.

178
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,460
- Is this seat taken? 
 - Yes.

179
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,540
- Gao has taken this seat. 
 - Just take it.

180
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,200
Li Xun. Isn't this too much?

181
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,890
You are nobody. Don't look down on us.

182
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,910
It's just a base.

183
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,550
- Forget it, Old Gao. 
 - Sit down!

184
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,360
You'd better dismiss your interest group.

185
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,900
What did you say?

186
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,410
If you think you can learn programming by reading a book about C language, you'd better give up.

187
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,140
You just did well in the college entrance examination.

188
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,340
I'm not worse than you.

189
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,270
I was only five places behind you.

190
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,910
You're not qualified to look down on me.

191
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,950
Do you only have No. 6 in the province to show off?

192
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,120
The college entrance examination is a watershed.

193
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,590
When it ends, we can complete fewer and fewer things by studying hard only.

194
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,190
If you are really smart, throw away the textbook and join my base.

195
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,390
I will teach you in the future.

196
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,060
Do you dare make a bet?

197
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,440
The midterm exam will take place in the week after next.

198
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,020
We'll compete.

199
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,030
If Gao and I get better C language scores than you,

200
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,840
your practice base must be incorporated into our interest group,

201
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,390
and you listen to us.

202
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,790
What if you lose?

203
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,330
We will dismiss the interest group, and we will leave the classroom to you.

204
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,310
Zhu Yun.

205
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,540
Are you playing house?

206
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,420
You're too childish. Make a bet on scores?

207
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,390
Okay.

208
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,880
I accept it.

209
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,910
Okay. So let's have a thorough competition.

210
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,640
It's boring to compete in C language.

211
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,810
Let's compete in the comprehensive ranking.

212
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,040
Introduction to the Basic Principles of Marxism, Advanced Mathematics and Software Engineering.

213
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,990
Old Gao, Li Xun is the top scorer in the college entrance examination.

214
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,030
Like he said, the college entrance examination is a watershed.

215
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,890
And PE course.

216
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,890
Okay.

217
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,580
I'll play this game with you.

218
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,620
Junior, in this case, we'll take Li Xun's side.

219
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,440
Fang Shumiao,  I...

220
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,920
Shumiao, I heard that Zhu Yun had a fight with Li Xun.

221
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,170
Are they really going to compete?

222
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,040
You're so gossipy.

223
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,780
We're going to take exams. You should focus on your studies.

224
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,970
She is really brave to challenge the top scorer.

225
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,470
Does love really beget hate?

226
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,250
She did so just because she was disappointed in love.

227
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,570
It's normal that they fall out and become enemies.

228
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,360
So many people have metaphrenia or psychological distortion.

229
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,940
Zhu Yun, hello.

230
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,850
Hi.

231
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,690
- Have you finished talking? 
 - Yes. Yes.

232
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,260
You don't need to ask Fang Shumiao next time.

233
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,040
You can ask me directly.

234
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,680
As far as I know, there are seven to eight types of metaphrenia.

235
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,920
Few people turn love into hate,

236
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,380
but many people are paranoid and have delusions.

237
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,290
You talk. I'm going. Bye-bye.

238
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,910
Do you know what sport Li Xun signed up for PE?

239
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,300
It seems to be dancesport.

240
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,680
What is that?

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,480
Ballroom dance.

242
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,390
The sports dance team of our school participated in the national youth competition last year.

243
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,280
They're quite good.

244
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,750
I think Li Xun chose this course randomly to get credits.

245
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,940
He probably doesn't know dance.

246
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,960
Even if he's the stop scorer, a genius, I don't believe he can dance.

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,880
Can you imagine how he looks when he dances wearing hip-hugging tights?

248
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,490
I can't imagine that.

249
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,470
I believe I can defeat him in the PE course.

250
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Boys and girls, come over.

251
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,000
Before the class, I'd like to tell you the midterm exam will take place in the next class.

252
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,310
Your grades in the midterm exam account for 30% of the final exam.

253
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,580
You have to attach importance to it.

254
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,940
30%?

255
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,740
Enough, enough. Stop complaining.

256
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,040
You need to take the exam anyway.

257
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,890
I have sent the video to your monitor. Go back and practice more.

258
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,780
Otherwise, I will fail you. Don't complain before me if you fail.

259
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,460
I will counterattack.

260
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,940
It's time for the library to close.

261
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,650
Please take your things and go back to the dormitory in order.

262
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,540
Let's go.

263
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,230
You go first.

264
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,450
We need to go back early, or we can't have hot water after going back.

265
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,290
Girls, it's time for the library to close.

266
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,130
Please pack up.

267
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,590
- You go back first. 
 - What do you want to do?

268
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,820
You can go on after going back to the dormitory.

269
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,960
If the dormitory cuts off internet access, I won't be able to check the codes.

270
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,580
You can leave it for tomorrow.

271
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,080
No. Old Gao and I have been stuck for days.

272
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,350
I'm going to the interest group later. I have to finish it tonight.

273
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,910
Mobile classrooms will be used as examination rooms tomorrow.

274
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,040
They won't be opened tonight.

275
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,150
If the teacher does a room inspection later, please cover for me.

276
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,950
Where are you going?

277
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,040
You put a lock on this door?

278
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,980
Do you take it as a free study room?

279
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,140
You come here without informing me.

280
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,730
It's a special circumstance today.

281
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,880
The exams will be held tomorrow, so many classrooms aren't opened.

282
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,680
I'll just use this place for the night.

283
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,550
And the roof doesn't belong to you.

284
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,350
Mr. Lin approved the base.

285
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,700
Is this place approved, too?

286
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,570
- Close the door. 
  - You didn't drive me away. I'll take that as a welcome. 

287
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,770
Before you officially lose, you can study at the base.

288
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,340
I have asked Liu Sisi and the others to leave the base.

289
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,430
Did you find your conscience? Don't want to use those dirty tricks anymore?

290
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,080
The competition has not started yet.

291
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,030
You have found an excuse for yourself?

292
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,320
You need to know that you will lose only because you are worse than me.

293
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,450
We don't know who will lose in the end.

294
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,640
And competition is only a form. We get what we learn.

295
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,820
You think I am hypocritical again.

296
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,960
Are you doing psychological construction for yourself?

297
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,550
I am giving you advice.

298
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,580
I'm afraid that you will take it too hard after you lose to me as a famous top scorer.

299
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,270
   

300
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,110
What's the model of your computer?

301
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,000
It starts up quite fast.

302
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,100
Master, how do you find a bug?

303
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,880
Be specific.

304
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,450
You can talk about it in a broad sense.

305
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,970
Did you do black-box testing?

306
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,450
I did boundary value testing.

307
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,420
Try all testing methods one by one and you will find it.

308
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,460
In that case, I need to stay up several more nights.

309
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,850
Logic.

310
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,200
What logic?

311
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,420
You like writing short codes.

312
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,300
Sometimes, the logic will be affected as you pursue concise codes too much.

313
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,660
Check it again.

314
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,560
I found it!

315
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,810
How do you know I like writing short codes?

316
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,560
Because you're boring.

317
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,130
You, good students, are mindless.

318
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,590
You take textbooks as golden rules.

319
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,070
   

320
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,860
   

321
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,140
   

322
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,400
"Nanhu University at 5:00 a.m, hello!"

323
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,850
So melodramatic.

324
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,820
Can't you talk nicely?

325
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,830
I don't care.

326
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,700
I think it's a happy thing to work hard for a goal.

327
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,900
I'm going.

328
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,050
Are you going?

329
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,550
Lock the door.

330
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,140
What's this?

331
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,380
So I can come here freely in the future.

332
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,520
   

333
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,760
 Did he escape? 

334
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,440
You can see the questions for filling in blanks on your computer.

335
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,200
You can just make your choices on it.

336
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,280
I will write the last programming question on the blackboard.

337
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,150
Have a look.

338
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,410
 Draw a love heart with programming. 

339
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,090
 It's so easy. 

340
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,260
 I didn't need to stay up for several nights actually. 

341
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,980
You can start.

342
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,360
   

343
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,290
 Why is his code so long? 

344
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,510
   
   

345
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,280
   

346
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,180
   
   

347
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,620
   

348
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,430
We've got the results.

349
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,940
Circulate it, class rep.

350
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,700
- What's your score? 
 - 100 points.

351
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,950
100 points.

352
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,840
Give it back to me.

353
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,050
   

354
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,050
Good. Your reading has paid off.

355
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,280
Do you regret competing with me?

356
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,650
I have something to say.

357
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,890
This class is a Q&amp;A class.

358
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,860
This is your first programming.

359
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,530
You can communicate to listen to how others think.

360
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,520
You can ask me if you are met with any problem.

361
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,540
But I have to remind you that you should keep your voices down.

362
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,110
Though you can communicate, you can't be too noisy in class.

363
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,390
Master, look at mine, please.

364
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,310
This is my thinking.

365
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,560
- Did you fail in advanced mathematics? 
 - No.

366
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,490
It looks like you never learned it.

367
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,000
Show me yours.

368
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,070
You may not be able to understand it.

369
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,800
You can look at the class rep's.

370
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,240
That's concise.

371
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,590
I used two "For" cycles.

372
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,510
Function can be used.

373
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,730
I didn't think of this. Thank you.

374
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,590
It's normal. I sometimes did so as well.

375
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,720
You'll know after you get familiar with it.

376
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,520
You think I am hypocritical again.

377
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,740
You have good ears.

378
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,810
Show me yours.

379
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,980
Don't force yourself if you don't understand, or you will be depressed.

380
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,620
 You did a great job. 

381
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,210
 - Okay. Class is over. 
 - Thank you, Mr. Lin. 

382
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,470
 Bye. 

383
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,390
 Me? 

384
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,320
 I didn't get 100 points. 

385
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,050
   

386
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,290
   

387
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,450
 Have you decoded it? 

388
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,470
   

389
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,850
   

390
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,730
   

391
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,820
 It's like this. 

392
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,920
Wow... I seem to have been hit with a dimensional collapse strike.

393
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,560
In fact, I didn't tell you something as I was afraid it would shake your confidence.

394
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,180
Though Li Xun stays in the base every day, he never reviews.

395
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,540
What he wrote is outsourced work.

396
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,250
Comparisons are odious.

397
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,220
A curve wrecker gets 100 points because the full score is 100 points only.

398
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,120
This is the gap between you and the curve wrecker... no, the academic prodigy.

399
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,100
Zhu Yun, let's dismiss the interest group.

400
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,970
- But... 
 - In fact, it's Li Xun who decoded the virus.

401
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,730
Wu Mengxing went to ask me about the writing of the worm virus one day.

402
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,960
That's why I knew where to start.

403
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,120
It must have been Li Xun who let Wu Mengxing ask me on purpose.

404
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,260
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to do it.

405
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,940
Li Xun must have known we couldn't decode it, so he asked Wu Mengxing to give us a clue indirectly.

406
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,030
It's really a dimensional collapse strike.

407
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,150
He gives alms to you when he wants

408
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,790
and destroys you when he wants.

409
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,960
And you can do nothing about it.

410
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,730
It sounds like this cold master has compassion for girls.

411
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,940
Don't pull a long face.

412
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,240
We didn't lose in this competition.

413
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,940
This is...

414
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,700
This is not acquisition, but merger.

415
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,180
Well, let's drink to celebrate our interest group's official dismissal.

416
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,410
It is never too late to mend.

417
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,670
Dignity is nothing important compared to the future.

418
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,690
- Drink. 
 - It makes sense.

419
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,670
I won't drink.

420
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,690
Zhu Yun, when will you be able to have a drink for adults?

421
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,200
Fang Shumiao, you're a traitor.

422
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,390
You're not qualified to say that.

423
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,020
You already joined the base.

424
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,800
You seem righteous at ordinary times, but you're the first one who betrayed us.

425
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,070
Yeah.

426
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,680
We'll be in the same organization in the future.

427
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,000
Can you both join the base?

428
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,450
To become better, we should stay with people who are better than us.

429
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm in.

430
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,200
I haven't made up my mind.

431
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,400
What do you want to do?

432
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,070
In fact, I envy you guys.

433
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,800
You know what you want.

434
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,350
Shumiao wants to be recommended for postgraduate education.

435
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,920
Old Gao wants to study abroad.

436
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,470
But my mom made every decision for me,

437
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,260
including the decisions to choose this major and to be the class rep.

438
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,760
I even considered switching majors.

439
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,440
You were full of fight when you made a bet with Li Xun.

440
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,390
There's endless joy in fighting with others.

441
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,140
But I still don't know if I like programming or not.

442
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,470
You are just slow.

443
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,190
Some time ago, you acted like a bulldog eager to fight.

444
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,690
It was quite good.

445
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,570
Don't think too much.

446
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,300
Oh! The PE test has not started yet.

447
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,070
What? Do you want to turn the tables?

448
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,960
We lost, but I need to let him know we didn't lose in the exams.

449
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,690
You're trying to save your dignity forcibly.

450
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,690
I want to do it just in case.

451
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,740
He's so good.

452
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,060
What if he hacks into the school's system to change the grades?

453
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,660
It sounds good.

454
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,390
He can do that.

455
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,230
Why didn't I think of this?

456
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,290
Can I ask him to change mine?

457
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,490
You are such an excellent class cadre.

458
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,520
You are such an excellent monitor.

459
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,860
Good. Next group, Chen Ting, Li Mao.

460
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,220
 Like I said, he wouldn't come. 

461
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,280
Is there anyone who hasn't taken the test?

462
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,930
Li Xun.

463
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,370
Li Xun from Applied Technology Class 1.

464
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,060
Are you here?

465
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,390
Okay. Class is over.

466
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,580
Sorry, teacher.

467
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,330
- Are you Li Xun? 
 - Yes.

468
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,180
Are you coming for the test?

469
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,740
You never had a class. Do you want to take the test?

470
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,360
Retake the course next year.

471
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,890
Please look at this.

472
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,280
   

473
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,780
Exemption due to illness?

474
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,510
Teacher, I have a spinal injury.

475
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,800
- Okay. You all can go back. 
  - How come he can pass it? 

476
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,840
Class rep, do you care so much about me?

477
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,800
You even came to supervise the test.

478
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,450
I was afraid you would escape.

479
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,890
You wanted to see me fail.

480
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,900
Where did you get the certificate for sick leave?

481
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,360
You cheated the teacher with it.

482
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,770
Did you see me forge it?

483
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,340
I never heard that you were so ill that you couldn't attend the dance class.

484
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,580
There are many things you have never heard.

485
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,680
Are you really ill?

486
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,440
What is it? Is it serious?

487
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,290
You're the sick one.

488
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,540
What?

489
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,900
About the competition, I've talked with Old Gao.

490
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,380
We will dismiss the interest group.

491
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,550
That classroom is yours.

492
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,360
Why?

493
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,030
No why. We lost interest.

494
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,350
You finally know your limitations.

495
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,350
Not really.

496
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,200
You didn't defeat us in the competition.

497
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,770
We take everyone's interest into account and chose to make peace.

498
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,340
   

499
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,090
Come in.

500
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,740
Li Xun...

501
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,400
You can use this classroom.

502
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,950
We didn't lose this time.

503
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,920
It was a draw.

504
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,600
Anything else?

505
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,910
Can I join the base?

506
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,910
I didn't say anything.

507
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,350
You used dichotomy to search for an algorithm to draw the heart, right?

508
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,620
Did you look at my program?

509
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,190
To be honest,

510
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,340
it's quite difficult to find someone who is capable in the base.

511
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
Read it all tonight.

512
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,810
Thanks.

513
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,680
   

514
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,150
Wait!

515
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,740
Several.

516
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,500
Hey!

517
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,120
Ren Di.

518
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,200
Going shopping? You rarely have time.

519
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,010
It's the weekend. And I don't need to go to the base.

520
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,150
I have plenty of time.

521
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:09,540
Are you going shopping as well? Together?

522
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,430
I'm waiting for someone.

523
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:26,970


524
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,760
   

525
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
 Everyone, everyone. Look, look. 

526
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,900
 I have something to announce. This is the princess I invited here. 

527
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,640
 Exploiter Li. He exploits labor before he becomes a capitalist. 

528
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,430
 It's vulgar. 

529
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,850
 Say that again. 

530
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,900
 - You misunderstood. 
 - Say that again. 

531
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,880
 - You misunderstood. 
 - Say it. 

532
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:52,200
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

533
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,120
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

534
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,080
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

535
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:07,680
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

536
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,500
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

537
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,880
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

538
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,920
♫  We will not separate  ♫

539
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,040
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

540
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,480
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

541
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,520
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

542
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:44,580
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

543
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,260
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

544
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,820
♫  True love will take its course ♫

545
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,820
♫  True love will take its course ♫

546
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,500
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

547
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,060
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

548
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,520
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

549
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,000
♫  That hot firework  ♫

550
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:29,500
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

551
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,560
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

552

♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

556
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,580
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

557
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,900
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

558
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,400
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

559
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:20,960
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

560
