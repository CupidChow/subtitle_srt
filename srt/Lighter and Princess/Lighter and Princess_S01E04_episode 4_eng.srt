00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:15,980


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,900
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,760
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,600
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,040
   

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,850
Hello.

23
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,660
 Zhu Yun, Li Xun has come for morning self-study. 

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,800
What?

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
 Where are you? 

26
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,470
Whose coat are you wearing?

27
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,120
Mine.

28
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,090
 What a fool. 

29
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,890
- Where did you go with Li Xun last night? 
 - We didn't go anywhere.

30
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,410
But you stayed out all night.

31
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,800
But he is attending the morning self-study.

32
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,020
Don't be nervous. We're not here for invigilation.

33
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,280
Don't worry.

34
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,830
Mr. Lin and I are here for something

35
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,400
but not giving you a class.

36
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,050
Li Xun, tell them.

37
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,810
I've applied to our department for establishing a digital practice base for us students.

38
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,190
Led by Miss Zhang and instructed by Mr. Lin,

39
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,910
this base can work as the second classroom practice

40
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,280
and offer credits as an elective course.

41
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,940
During practice in the base, you can be exempt from morning and evening self-study.

42
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,010
 It's excellent. 

43
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,940
 - We can be exempt from morning and evening self-study. 
 - That's great. 

44
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,160
How did you persuade him?

45
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,360
We even won't have morning and evening self-study.

46
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,490
You pleased him but hurt us.

47
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,690
Be quiet. Be quiet. Any problem?

48
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,700
Miss Zhang, can students of other majors join it?

49
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,960
Of course.

50
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,430
Let me add something.

51
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,720
Students of other majors can join it, but we have requirements.

52
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,670
Only after passing the final exam can you gain credits.

53
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,370
As freshmen, you should focus on studying.

54
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,690
If you want to fulfill the learning task by taking part in social practice,

55
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,160
your learning can't be affected.

56
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,250
That's all.

57
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,000
Go on with your self-study and discuss it after class.

58
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,670
Don't you think Li Xun is fighting against our interest group by doing this?

59
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,060
Li Xun!

60
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,120
Zhu Yun, do you dislike me so much?

61
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Why didn't you knock at the door?

62
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,780
I don't need to ask for your approval for returning to my dorm.

63
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,350
I didn't mean to throw it at you.

64
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,130
Who did you want to throw it at?

65
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,930
You dislike him so much that you want to hurt his body.

66
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,830
Read this.

67
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,850
 Sorry, Yun is sleeping. 

68
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,800
Is this the Li Xun who gave your phone back?

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,070
Bad. So bad.

70
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,110
Let me join you.

71
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,370
Infect my computer with virus!

72
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,740
Absent from morning self-study!

73
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,040
Die in the river!

74
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,180
Absent from morning self-study!

75
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,550
Replies with random messages!

76
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,320
Absent from morning self-study!

77
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,390
It seems that Li Xun and I have only this one enmity.

78
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,620
Zhu Yun, you two have many conflicts.

79
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,110
Be cautious.

80
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,320
Why?

81
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Hate begets love.

82
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,660
Impossible!

83
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,350
 What do you think of the three-pointer this afternoon? 

84
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,510
 Cool. 

85
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,170
 - Let's continue another day. 
 - Okay. 

86
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,160
 Invite more players. 

87
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,460
 Yes. Invite players of the university basketball team. 

88
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,250
 -  Even if it rains, we'll also play? 
 - Men should play basketball in rainy days. 

89
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,190
Li Xun, you've never taken part in any activity.

90
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,540
Join us. Play basketball with us.

91
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,000
- I'm not interested in it. 
 - You can't?

92
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,300
I can't.

93
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,260
I'm only good at one sport.

94
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,270
I see. Men shouldn't waste physical power in something meaningless.

95
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,810
Join us.

96
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,010
Let's go.

97
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,910
Li Xun, the establishment of the base today was discussed between you and Mr. Lin. Right?

98
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,380
Does it have anything to do with you?

99
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,260
Mr. Lin knows that my interest group

100
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,190
is organized for mutual learning and improvement.

101
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,700
It's fine if you don't participate,

102
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,000
but establish a base that can offer credits instead.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,280
Where did this policy advantage come from?

104
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,690
It turns out that you care about this.

105
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,660
I want to compete with you fairly,

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,230
but you put pressure on us publicly in this way.

107
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,450
As university students, we should do something meaningful but not waste time.

108
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,080
I don't waste time.

109
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,390
If the interest group wastes time, the base won't waste time?

110
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,150
You're being paranoid.

111
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,460
I mean, don't waste time competing with me.

112
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,480
Li Xun, you run your base, and I'll organize my interest group.

113
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,850
We mind our own business.

114
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,780
I won't occupy your space, and you can't poach my members.

115
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,280
Whatever.

116
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,820
Zhu Yun, have a look.

117
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,420
How is it? I made it by using Java.

118
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,350
It looks simple but it's easy.

119
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,480
Let me show you its system architecture diagram.

120
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,690
First, create a new Maven.

121
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,950
Based on POM, Maven can facilitate our management of project dependencies,

122
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,690
build projects, and generate code documents.

123
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,660
After setting up some parameters...

124
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,470
After setting up some parameters,

125
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,780
we can get a new project with a perfect organizational structure.

126
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,640
Good, Gao. You designed a well-organized structure in a short time.

127
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,290
Well, Zhu Yun, I also searched the CCPC.

128
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,280
An online contest of the China Collegiate Programming Contest (CCPC) will be held every August.

129
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,970
We can't take part in the CCPC this year, but we can be prepared for the next one.

130
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,280
Its prize is good for studying abroad and a postgraduate recommendation,

131
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,270
and we can exercise ourselves in it.

132
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,000
You think about much as a freshman.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,420
You're foresighted.

134
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,540
I used to it.

135
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,310
Zhu Guang, do you have any talent?

136
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,980
No, I don't have any talent.

137
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,430
- Li Wei, can you play any musical instrument? 
 - No.

138
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,110
- Play the piano? 
 - I can't.

139
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,720
Violin? Or Erhu?

140
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,640
- No. No. 
 - Monitor Fang, can you be quiet for a while?

141
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,920
No.

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,380
This classroom is for the interest group.

143
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,520
You can go somewhere else to invite others to the performance.

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Shut up if you don't know anything.

145
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,950
I can program. Can I perform it?

146
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,900
Stop and take a break.

147
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,460
This group only has a few members, but you've driven away all of them.

148
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,730
Students are no longer active in activities.

149
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,070
We just need to choose a performer for the welcome party, but nobody has signed up for it.

150
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,580
Why don't they have a sense of collective honor in the university?

151
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,700
In high school, we always actively took part in all the activities.

152
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,290
During the sports meeting, even many students ran the 800-meter or 1,000-meter race.

153
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,560
At the art performance, I even performed crosstalk on stage.

154
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,170
Crosstalk is good.

155
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,190
Can't you perform it?

156
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,450
You assist me?

157
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,030
Impossible.

158
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,670
Unreliable. Unreliable.

159
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,160
Did you ask Ren Di about it?

160
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,460
Of course.

161
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,390
We filled the student information sheet when the university started.

162
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,560
You may find one after browsing it.

163
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,520
You're going on a date?

164
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,390
I'm going to accompany a patient at the hospital.

165
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,050
Who?

166
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,740
Wu Mengxing.

167
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,300
I learned from the information sheet that some classmates

168
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,970
are Level 10 pianists or Level 9 violinists,

169
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,840
but they told me that they haven't played for many years.

170
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,560
They're all unreliable.

171
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,660
Wu Mengxing is incommunicative,

172
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,650
but he's good at playing a traditional musical instrument and often gave performances.

173
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,160
He is awesome.

174
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,690
Would he like to perform on stage after having an operation for appendicitis?

175
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,230
Only by exploiting himself can he know how much potential he has.

176
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,770
I'm leaving.

177
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,000
Wu Mengxing. Wu Mengxing.

178
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,240
Monitor, why are you here?

179
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Don't get up. Don't get up.

180
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,910
You, you sit.

181
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,460
How are you? Are you all right?

182
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,060
I'm all right.

183
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,980
Wu Mengxing, you've been sick for some days, but I didn't come to see you until now.

184
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,010
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,010
It doesn't matter.

186
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,480
Monitor, you're busy with class affairs.

187
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
I understand you. I can take good care of myself.

188
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,430
Well, are you doing better?

189
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,790
- Can you leave hospital? 
 - Almost.

190
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,060
I had an operation yesterday.

191
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,510
The doctor said that I can leave after discharging gas.

192
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,610
Discharge gas?

193
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,620
That is... fart.

194
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,700
How can you fart?

195
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,890
Do activities.

196
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,540
I see. Stand up.

197
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,680
Let me help you walk.

198
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,230
Now?

199
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,020
   

200
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,510
It doesn't matter. Go on walking.

201
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,300
You should have said something earlier.

202
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,260
That you were having an operation and your family isn't here.

203
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,380
Don't stand on ceremony.

204
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,230
I can look after you.

205
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,820
You farted. You farted.

206
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,830
Now that you've farted, so you can leave the hospital?

207
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,120
Don't worry, monitor.

208
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,430
I won't reduce our class attendance rate.

209
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm going to apply for discharge tomorrow.

210
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
It doesn't matter.

211
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Take your time, as long as you have a certificate for sick leave.

212
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,360
That classmate, Wu Mengxing, I think you are quite well-rounded.

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,480
You can also play traditional instruments and have participated in many performances.

214
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,390
What can you play?

215
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,210
Suona.

216
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,010
You, you're awesome.

217
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,610
Suona is the quintessence of Chinese culture.

218
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,610
Mengxing, our department will have a welcome party next Monday.

219
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,620
Would you like to promote traditional culture and play it in public?

220
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,840
I can't play it, but my father can.

221
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,390
I can only sound it.

222
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,380
Why did you write that you often gave performances?

223
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,060
My father was invited to play it at weddings or funerals in our village,

224
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,010
so I just sounded the suona and served as a stopgap.

225
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,060
It doesn't matter. Let's talk about it another day.

226
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,980
It's late. I'm leaving.

227
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,840
Have a good rest.

228
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,290
Monitor, take care.

229
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,930
Why didn't my father teach me?

230
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,560
   

231
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,130
Old Gao, this is the Maven dependency of Java web.

232
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,730
It's really much easier for you to do this.

233
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,260
And it also looks clean and tidy.

234
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,680
Old Lin told us to simplify codes as much as possible.

235
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,640
After finishing this, let's learn how to turn web pages into desktop programs.

236
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,600
Fang Shumiao, have you finished programming?

237
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,000
Fang Shumiao.

238
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,060
Fang Shumiao, you're absent-minded.

239
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,560
You talked to Wu Mengxing at the hospital?

240
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,760
Don't mention him to me.

241
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,580
You just came back from the hospital, but he has become your enemy now?

242
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,210
Wu Mengxing looks honest but is actually bad.

243
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,380
He told a lie.

244
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,830
He didn't give performances often,

245
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,610
but just sounded the suona at weddings or funerals instead.

246
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,960
What traditional instrumental music?

247
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,950
He can't play the suona at all.

248
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,810
When you needed him, you thought highly of him,

249
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,620
but now you scold him.

250
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,420
Fang Shumiao, you're bad.

251
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,600
Yun Yun, I only have you.

252
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,840
- Old Gao. 
 - I think it really needs to be revised here, right?

253
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,280
 Yes. It's not simple enough. 

254
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,400
Hello, everyone.

255
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,790
I'm Fang Shumiao from the Computer Science Department.

256
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,250
I'm Zhu Yun.

257
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,520
Today, we're going to perform crosstalk...

258
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,960
...to amuse you.

259
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,400
Zhu Yun, today, I'll ask you a question in front of so many people in the audience.

260
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,750
Okay.

261
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,110
 Did you go to college? 

262
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,890
 Are you talking nonsense? 

263
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,650
 Aren't we in college now? 

264
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,740
Thank you.

265
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,880
You've finished?

266
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,680
Isn't it funny?

267
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,320
Turn on your computers and learn now. Don't waste time.

268
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,850
What do you mean?

269
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,380
Monitor Fang, you've given a performance,

270
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,350
and we've also acted as the audience.

271
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,150
It's time to get down to business.

272
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,910
Well, now that you watched our performance, you should make an evaluation.

273
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,840
Do you want to know the truth?

274
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,120
If you don't want to defame our class, don't perform it.

275
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,700
Just this? You might as well ask Zhu Yun to touch her navel round her back.

276
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Is our performance really so bad?

277
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,800
You performed very well.

278
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,800
What's the name of this performance?

279
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,080
You two created it?

280
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,190
I think it should be named "living sculpture."

281
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,840
Li Xun, don't insult us.

282
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,750
Why aren't you typing your code on the rooftop but yet have come to make fun of us instead?

283
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,160
Don't you have self-knowledge?

284
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,810
I don't think your place should be called an interest group, but play house instead.

285
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,410
If you still do such meaningless things in university,

286
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,950
it would be better for your interests group to break up.

287
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,520
Stop wasting time and resources.

288
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Li Xun, we are all classmates. There is no need for you to speak so harshly. Right?

289
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah. You are too contemptuous of people.

290
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,200
Now that you look down upon us, why are you here?

291
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,550
Mr. Lin has approved this place for our practice base.

292
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,400
From now on it will be ours.

293
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,020
Why?

294
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,420
Stop!

295
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,930
We're indeed inferior to you. We played house.

296
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,710
But is it interesting to compete with us for this territory?

297
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,890
It's interesting.

298
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,680
Welcome party?

299
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,280
I really think you guys should do a show.

300
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,890
Other performers will play musical instruments, sing or dance.

301
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,670
They're boring.

302
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,170
You will be laughed at as soon as you stop there.

303
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,650
It'll be very good.

304
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,920
I have the ability to go on stage.

305
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,050
Do you have the ability to see?

306
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,120
You're inviting me?

307
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,250
You want me to go?

308
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,040
Immature.

309
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,650
Pupil.

310
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,900
Class cadres can get 20 points.

311
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,580
Excellent classes will get an extra 20 points.

312
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,650
Students who participate in the municipal first-level project of social practice can get 50 points,

313
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,330
and the prize winners will get an extra 50 points.

314
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,620
You haven't finished yet?

315
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,350
I just edited a paragraph and sent it to you.

316
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
Zhu Yun, stop writing.

317
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,210
I didn't sign up for our performance at all.

318
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,670
Our class already quit this activity.

319
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,030
You can give up, but I won't. I can turn it into a talk show.

320
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,470
Yun Yun, give up.

321
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,450
No.

322
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,810
I'll absolutely perform this talk show.

323
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,520
What's the function of this paper plane?

324
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,180
This is the theme of this freshmen's joint performance.

325
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,740
 Take care. Take care. 

326
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,760
 Take good photos. 

327
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,970
   

328
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,270
This girl plays the violin well.

329
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,190
She also looks good.

330
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah, she is pretty,

331
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,850
but maybe I can't conquer her heart.

332
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,660
Her heart doesn't want to be conquered by you, either.

333
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,520
I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department.

334
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,490
Since I was young, I've never liked my family name.

335
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,250
As we know...

336
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,710
Okay?

337
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,800
You can do it.

338
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,970
   

339
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,280
Thanks. Thanks, everyone.

340
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,920
Actually, I played it for a boy.

341
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,160
   

342
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,280
He just got here.

343
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,080
Li Xun from the Computer Science Department!

344
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,210
Maybe you don't know me, but today I must tell you something.

345
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,090
I...

346
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,430
always like you!

347
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,830
Li Xun!

348
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,180
Express love?

349
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,280
Li Xun is here?

350
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,350
Yes, he is under the stage.

351
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,380
Li Xun is too much!

352
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,290
He shouldn't leave that girl alone.

353
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,880
You say I'm fake, you're also fake.

354
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,460
Zhu Yun, Li Xun is here.

355
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,130
Can you give up?

356
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,290
He's so dead.

357
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:09,170
Girls who learn music are really extraordinary and enthusiastic.

358
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,150
She was so brave and outspoken in expressing her love.

359
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,480
Now, let's welcome Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department

360
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,690
to bring us a talk show.

361
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,890
Let's welcome her with applause!

362
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,270
 Zhu Yun! Zhu Yun! Zhu Yun! 

363
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,120
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department.

364
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,020
Since I was young, I've never liked my family name.

365
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,110
As we know, regardless of whether a girl is pretty or not,

366
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,190
as long as her family name is related to animals,

367
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,450
such as pig (zhu), sheep (yang), and cow (niu), her name is vulgar.

368
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,140
My father dotes on me.

369
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,020
He has encouraged me since my childhood.

370
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,750
He even gave me a cute nickname, Piggy.

371
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,790
"Piggy," he said, "whatever you want, I'll do my best to get it for you."

372
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,320
"Really, dad? I want a dog," I replied.

373
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,670
"No way!" He said.

374
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,580
I'm very happy at university,

375
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,380
because single students (single dogs) are everywhere.

376
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:36,590
One day, I saw an in-your-face ownerless dog near the first canteen.

377
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,560
It was a golden retriever.

378
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,590
It is said that it's very clever and promising,

379
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,860
so I decided to keep it.

380
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:51,550
Now that I want to keep it, I want to cultivate it into a top dog.

381
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,820
I told the chef of the first canteen that I wanted the dog at the gate.

382
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,580
Then the chef came out with a kitchen knife

383
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,840
and asked me whether I wanted a braised or steamed one.

384
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,100
I refused him and told him that I wanted to send it to school and cultivate it into a top dog.

385
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,390
The chef took a dislike to me.

386
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,610
He asked me whether I was insane or not.

387
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,650
Regardless of whether I was insane or not, I insisted on keeping this dog.

388
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,330
I wanted the golden retriever to attend morning self-study.

389
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,800
I stroked it and asked, "Golden Retriever, do you want to go to school?"

390
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,650
 Do you think it's useful to study in the morning? 

391
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,820
 Three chances. 

392
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,700
 - If you make it, I'll attend the morning self-study. 
 - Game over. 

393
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,100
But it bit me.

394
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,080
 You are so fake. 

395
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,590
While I had myself vaccinated against rabies,

396
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,500
I thought about whether I stroked it in the wrong way or not.

397
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,290
I still went to see it the next day,

398
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,650
because I could have myself vaccinated against rabies,

399
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,830
but it couldn't have itself vaccinated against me.

400
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,990
 Are you afraid to hand it in? 

401
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,560
 Afraid? 

402
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,720
 This seems to be a virus. 

403
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,920
The third time, I specially brought it lamb skewers.

404
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,490
 Do I have to give my heart to you after eating ten of your lamb skewers? 

405
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,880
 I… I didn't take my phone. Open the door. 

406
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,210
 Hello, Zhu Yun is busy now. 

407
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,900
 Okay, okay. 

408
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,680
As you expect, it ate my skewers but bit me again.

409
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,020
This dog is a real dog.

410
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,190
To achieve my goal, I was going to brainwash it.

411
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:54,550
Since then, I'd been calling it genius, master, or champion.

412
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,740
It seemed to understand my meaning.

413
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,980
Once I call it champion, it kept wagging its tail and was very happy.

414
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,800
Everyone knows that the Department of Computer Science has a golden retriever called Champion.

415
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,910
 K.O. 

416
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,610
After all, I'd paid so much sunk cost,

417
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,320
so I decided to educate it for the last time.

418
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,590
But it didn't appreciate what I did for it, so I got angry.

419
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,000
I thought it might be better to raise a pig than keep it. I should kill it.

420
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,990
I asked the chef to take it away angrily,

421
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,720
but after all, it was a dog, so I should rescue it.

422
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,490
I hurried to the first canteen,

423
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,690
but I saw this golden retriever fade in the pot after opening the door.

424
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,310
It turns out that the golden retriever was just a rural dog.

425
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,890
It fell into the paint bucket and was dyed golden,

426
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,880
but it finally restored its original appearance.

427
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,950
The chef muttered, "It's just a rural dog."

428
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,720
After hearing this,

429
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,790
this dying rural dog immediately barked,

430
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,600
"Who are you scolding? I'm the top dog but not a rural dog."

431
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,950
Thank you, I'm Zhu Yun.

432
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,490
 Great! Great! 

433
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,570
 Great! Great! 

434
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,690
 Hi, dear students, it's surprising that the girl from the Computer Science Department... 

435
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,750
- What are they doing? 
 - What's up?

436
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,430
Piggy,

437
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,050
it turns out that you have been keeping an eye on me.

438
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,750
You don't have to keep an eye on me.

439
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,570
We can be together in the open.

You're awake. Your phone has been vibrating all this time.

453
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,300
My Renren account has been flooded with messages.

454
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,150
It's not a big deal.

455
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,730
The post has been pinned to the top of the forum.

456
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,420
You went viral, Zhu Yun.

457
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,680
   

458
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,760
 Little Piggy, 

459
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,340
 it turns out that you have been keeping an eye on me. 

460
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,530
   

461
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,990
Tell me the truth. When were you with Li Xun?

462
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,240
You should be blamed for it.

463
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,160
- I bravely gave myself up for you. 
 - You really gave yourself up?

464
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Fang Shumiao, you want to be beaten?

465
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,240
As the saying goes, only those who care about you keep an eye on you.

466
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,980
If you didn't like Li Xun a little bit, why pay attention to him so much?

467
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,970
Okay, I'm wrong.

468
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,240
Go wash your face and brush your teeth. We need to attend class at 10:00.

469
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,990
I'm about to take a bath. I was so tired that I forgot to take a bath yesterday.

470
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,550
Fang Shumiao, will I be recognized if I go out?

471
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:35,480
Did you really think you were the heroine of celebrity gossip?  Heroine?

472
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,400
Others are just interested in it momentarily and will forget you soon.

473
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,510
You're awesome. I heard that you've been with Li Xun.

474
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,610
Oh, no. Even people like you who don't go to school for a week know about it.

475
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,480
Fang Shumiao, come with me.

476
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,860
No one will recognize you without your clothes on.

477
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,940
Did you watch yesterday's video?

478
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,100
At the welcome party, that girl from the Computer Science Department seemed to express her love.

479
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,270
I even secretly searched her account to browse on Renren.com,

480
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,450
but I couldn't search that boy's account.

481
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,520
That video is really sweet.

482
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,820
And that boy is very handsome.

483
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,710
He seems famous. His name is Li Xun, right?

484
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,330
- Yes. 
 - He even called her Little Piggy in a low voice.

485
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,540
So warm.

486
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,240
The love story of Little Piggy and the ownerless dog is sweet.

487
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,340
I ship them. I ship them.

488
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,040
I seem to have forgotten to bring my campus card.

489
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,720
Search for it again.

490
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,080
Girl, I want to borrow your campus card.

491
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,770
I also forget to bring it.

492
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,660
Whose is this?

493
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,840
Zhu Yun, is this that girl from the Computer Science Department who expressed her love?

494
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,200
- She seems to be that girl. 
 - She's really that girl.

495
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,210
- Is it hot? 
 - No, it's not hot.

496
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,230
Why were you so shy?

497
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,480
You were recognized. Why escape?

498
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,790
My lie was exposed on the spot.

499
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,950
Of course I escaped.

500
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,920
What are you doing?

501
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm about to issue a statement.

502
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,630
Why don't you invite a few reporters and hold a press conference?

503
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,610
What's the use of this explanation?

504
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,910
I just learned web programming yesterday and I am using it today.

505
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,080
How is it?

506
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,650
 Solemnly declare that everything that happened at the orientation party yesterday was just a stage effect. 

507
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,790
 I'm still single. 

508
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,000
Old Gao was right.

509
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,060
We students of applied technology need practice.

510
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,070
We may learn everything at a crucial time.

511
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,950
Zhu Yun!

512
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,150
That was just a part of my performance.

513
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,690
What I did was just for the stage effect.

514
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,710
I don't like Li Xun. I won't be with him.

515
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,700
Are you satisfied?

516
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,330
Really?

517
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,580
Look. I just issued a statement on Renren.com.

518
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,540
Can you believe me now?

519
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,980
 Sorry, I shouldn't anger you. 

520
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,670
Zhu Yun, you liar!

521
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,740
Is this really Li Xun?

522
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,810
Does he also use this software?

523
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,560
He'd do anything to play tricks on me.

524
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,820
Dear teachers and students, this is the broadcast station of Nanhu University.

525
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,170
I'm Yuan Xiaoyun.

526
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,740
Good afternoon, everyone.

527
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,570
This afternoon, I'll host the column "Free Speaking" for you.

528
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,770
If you have something or worries to say,

529
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,660
please feel free to contribute to our broadcasting station’s Weibo public account.

530
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,630
Now, please listen to a piece of music.

531
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,840
- Zhu Yun. 
 - Little Piggy.

532
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,420
Xiaoyun, I want to contribute.

533
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,120
 Hello, everyone. We received a special contribution, and the contributor is sitting next to me. 

534
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,910
 She is Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department. 

535
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,740
 Something has been troubling her these days, 

536
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,050
 so she wants to issue a statement through our broadcast station. 

537
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,380
 Hello, everyone. I'm Zhu Yun from Class 1 of the Computer Science Department. 

538
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,440
 At yesterday's welcome party, 

539
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,480
 I performed a talk show on behalf of our class, 

540
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,620
 but something happened at the end of my talk show 

541
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,410
 that made you misunderstand my relationship with Li Xun. 

542
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,060
 Here, I want to tell you that Li Xun was just my guest performer, 

543
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,720
and we don't have any personal relationship.

544
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,860
I hope you don't misunderstand.

545
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,430
 I'm sorry for taking up your time. 

546
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,090
 Thank you. 

547
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,820
Zhu Yun's statement is really effective.

548
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,800
When I went to a student union meeting, people chased me and asked if Li Xun in your class was single again.

549
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,630
Congratulations, Little Piggy.

550
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,810
It's finally clear.

551
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,760
Almost? Yet?

552
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,440
I don't care. Anyway, I'm relieved.

553
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,250
Fang Shumiao, if I hear "Little Piggy" again,

554
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,990
I'll beat the speakers, especially you.

555
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,820
It's strange.

556
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,500
Besides good grades, what are Li Xun's other advantages?

557
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,740
Why do good girls all like him?

558
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,500
Just because of his unique hair style and personality?

559
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,140
Zhu Yun, I agree with you about making fun of him on stage.

560
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,820
Look.

561
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,840
What-What happened?

562
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,130
You made it clear?

563
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,440
The golden retriever's hair faded?

564
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,080
♫  Don't know how you've been there  ♫

565
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,180
♫  Don't know how I've been there  ♫

566
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,940
Zhu Yun, he didn't really dye his hair black for you, did he?

567
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,660
♫  Nothing wrong, so alone  ♫

568
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,340
 That's all for today. 

569
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,840
 Class is over! 

570
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,390
Let's have a talk.

571
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,480
It's bad to talk here.

572
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,160
They bickered.

573
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,940
I want to talk about something important.

574
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,040
Let's talk outside.

575
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,860
No need. Just talk here.

576
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,940
I'll finish soon.

577
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,540
In front of so many classmates?

578
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,720
- You... 
 - Go ahead.

579
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,500
Why did you make that comment on my page?

580
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,350
What comment?

581
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,020
Forget it. Can't you assist me in clearly explaining that

582
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,740
I'm not your girlfriend?

583
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,950
- Why? 
 - What "why"?

584
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,110
Now that you're not my girlfriend, why should I help you?

585
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,470
You're glad about being watched by so many classmates, right?

586
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,860
Yes.

587
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,250
Who is your guest performer?

588
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,700
Did you ask me?

589
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,570
Li Xun, why did you dye your hair black?

590
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,540
You did so due to my words?

591
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,950
If my words hurt you, I'm sorry.

592
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,450
We can take this opportunity to make this matter clear together.

593
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,430
You're touchy-feely but cute.

594
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,740
What else do you want to do?

595
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,140
Issue another statement?

596
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,950
Do you know the more you explain, the more darker and darker it gets?

597
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,640
 Aren't you getting darker and darker now?  Completely dark. 

598
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,920
- Hello, Mr. Lin. 
 - Hi, Mr. Lin. 
 - Hi.

599
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,780
Li Xun.

600
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,380
You dyed your hair black?

601
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,710
It looks better.

602
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,500
You asked me not be so eccentric.

603
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,650
Yes.

604
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,800
Does he look better?

605
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,410
Good.

606
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,280
I'm telling you for the last time.

607
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,780
I'm not your guest performer.

608
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,820
It's not my duty to help you.

609
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,000
   

610
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,120
   

611
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,960
♫  Who controls the marionette? ♫

612
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,120
♫  The flickering candle flame is asking me  ♫

613
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,980
♫  What hides behind the deep fear?  ♫

614
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,360
♫  Love and hate are reversed  ♫

615
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,760
♫  Forgotten stories. Days covered with dust  ♫

616
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,940
♫  Time is waiting for me like amber  ♫

617
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,780
♫  The reflected world makes a knot in the heart  ♫

618
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,500
♫  How could love be inexplicable?  ♫

619
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,540
♫  Cruel truth is revealed in the blink of an eye ♫

620
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,100
♫  Who is acting vigorously with the masked face?  ♫

621
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,840
♫  Sad truth is uncovered in a trice  ♫

622
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,520
♫  Presumptuously shout and laugh at me  ♫

623
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,240
♫  Cruel truth is good or bad?  ♫

624
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,460
♫  Who mourns for the silent solemnity with soul?  ♫

625
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,220
♫  The definitions of love and hate have been blurred  ♫

626
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,000
Thank you.

627
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,220
Thanks, everyone. We're Light Red Band!

628
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,560
How was our song?

629
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,650
- I can't understand. 
 - Would you like to invest in our band?

630
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,230
What will I get?

631
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,770
If you invest in our band, you'll be our boss and have shares in our band.

632
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,110
The shares in your band?

633
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:15,040
When our band makes profits, the profits will be allocated to you at the agreed rate.

634
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,850
- Okay. 
 - Keep your word?

635
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,230
Of course. Do I need to pay a deposit today?

636
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,860
It's a deal.

637
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,220
Boss Li, feel free to request any song that you want to listen to!

638
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,260
We'll only work for you today.

639
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,870
Why are you here?

640
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,220
Hard to listen to.

641
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,500
Do our songs sound so bad?

642
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,050
Don't get me wrong.

643
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,000
I'll definitely invest in your band.

644
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,550
I just didn't want to waste time inside.

645
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,530
Listening to our songs is a waste of time.

646
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,520
Isn't your current behavior a waste of time?

647
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,970
Please respect the fund source of your Light Red Band.

648
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,340
You earn so much money by doing this?

649
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,950
You shouldn't go to university.

650
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,770
If I were you, I would have dropped out.

651
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,110
Anyway, you neither attend self-study nor do homework.

652
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,940
I neither do homework nor attend self-study because they're very easy for me.

653
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,710
I don't want to do anything meaningless.

654
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,950
I've established a practice base.

655
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,920
You can join it.

656
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,030
I made a special application with the department.

657
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,550
Credits can be added and early self-study can be exempted.

658
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,050
It's good for you.

659
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,750
That's why you dyed your hair black?

660
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,150
I need to slightly respect Mr. Lin.

661
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,610
Gosh, it's amazing.

662
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,580
Li Xun is going to be a good boy.

663
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,940
I thought you did so due to Zhu Yun.

664
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:54,190


665
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,700
   

666
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,490
 Your base has seriously affected our interest group. 

667
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,340
 This classroom is for our base. You'd better dismiss your interest group. 

668
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,260
 You are nobody. Don't look down upon us. 

669
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,670
 Do you dare make a bet? 

670
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,490
 If Old Gao and I get better C Language scores than you, 

671
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,610
 your practice base must be incorporated into our interest group, 

672
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,990
 and you listen to us. 

673
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,840
 What if you lose? 

674
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,220
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

675
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:26,040
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

676
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,060
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

677
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:36,740
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

678
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,320
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

679
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,900
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

680
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:53,940
♫  We will not separate  ♫

681
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,060
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

682
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,500
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

683
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,540
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

684
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,400
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

685
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,280
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

686
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,740
♫  True love will take its course ♫

687
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,940
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

688
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,520
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

689
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,080
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

690
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,540
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

691
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,000
♫  That hot firework  ♫

692
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:58,520
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

693
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,480
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

694
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,420
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

695
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,400
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

696
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,880
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

697
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,120
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

698
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,600
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

699
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,820
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

700
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,420
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

701
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:50,000
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

702
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,580
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

703
