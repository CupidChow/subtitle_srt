00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:16,000


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,500
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,420
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,360
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,700
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,530
   

21
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,040
   

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,820
   

23
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,570
He still doesn't want to see me?

24
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,420
Don't think too much. Have the surgery first.

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,500
Let's talk about other matters after you recover.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,220
Even if I'm dying,

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,600
he still doesn't want to see me? Right?

28
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,320
What's wrong with you, Old Gao?

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,220
I'll call the doctor.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,230
I told Fang Zhijing.

31
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,570
At that time, I was supposed to have a bright future.

32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,810
I could finally get rid of his shadow.

33
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,250
But he provoked Fang Zhijing.

34
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,970
He insisted.

35
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,930
 I begged you. I begged you desperately. 

36
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,920
 Why didn't you lower your head once? 

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,120
You know he did it for you.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,950
I know. Of course, I know.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,530
But when Fang Zhijing came to me that day,

40
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,580
I was so angry.

41
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,930
I hated him.

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,610
I just wanted to destroy him.

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,830
I told Fang Zhijing Li Xun's sister lived in the Guojiao Hotel.

44
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,030
 He'll keep an eye on you as he said. 

45
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,580
 I don't need to waste my time. 

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,670
 But for his sister coming here, he won't let you go. 

47
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,240
 When she leaves, he'll try many ways to make you suffer. 

48
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,040
I just wanted to teach Li Xun a lesson.

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,860
I didn't expect the result.

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,970
I never thought Li Lan would die.

51
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,320
I was afraid that things would be exposed.

52
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,800
I'm afraid that Li Xun would know from Fang Zhijing...

53
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,560
that I said it.

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,540
I could only make him hate Fang Zhijing more.

55
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,310
I was scared. Do you understand?

56
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,540
I was really scared.

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,230
1986.05.17 - 2016.03.15

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,290
I always wanted to forget this matter.

59
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,880
But I can't forget it.

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,250
I also dreamed that...

61
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,910
the three of us stood on the top of the mountain,

62
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,200
talking about Blue Crown's APP.

63
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,320
In my dream, the three of us,

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,610
on the day when we had the farewell dinner at the base,

65
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,380
we stood on the roof and chatted about our dreams and future.

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,450
 Our L &amp; P will always leave you a position as the partner. 

67
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,650
 You will always have a share in our L &amp; P. 

68
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,130
 Eternal trio. 

69
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,900
At that time,

70
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,210
the days were so good.

71
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,790
I always recall these things.

72
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,000
The more I think, the more serious my headache becomes.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,370
The more it hurts, the more I hate him.

74
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,120
We shouldn't be like this.

75
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,170
He was wrong.

76
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,540
He forced me. He kept stepping on me.

77
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,430
He asked me if I regret.

78
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,630
Zhu Yun, go ask him.

79
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,290
Ask him. Ask him whether he regrets it or not.

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,700
Old Gao, everyone makes mistakes.

81
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,580
Li Xun has forgiven you.

82
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,570
Impossible.

83
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,700
How can he forgive me?

84
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,110
He shouldn't have forgiven me.

85
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,390
It's me. It's me who wanted to step on him.

86
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,180
It's me who stopped him from standing up. It's me.

87
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,960
Don't think too much. Go and have the operation first, okay?

88
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,910
I won't have it. I know it's useless to have an operation.

89
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,960
I know.

90
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,720
The surgery department urged again.

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,450
Director Liang still has a surgery behind him.

92
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,940
Tell them. I won't have it.

93
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,620
Old Gao.

94
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,140
I'm tired.

95
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,570
I just want to take a break. I won't have it.

96
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,150
I'm tired.

97
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,400
I just want to take a break.

98
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,930
 Let Gao Jianhong answer the phone. 

99
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,660
It's Li Xun.

100
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,420
Gao Jianhong.

101
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,340
Are you not convinced?

102
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,350
If you are not convinced,

103
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,880
you have to live for me.

104
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,710
   

105
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,160
Wait a minute.

106
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,470
Zhu Yun.

107
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,590
Ask him.

108
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,280
If he regrets it a little bit,

109
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,390
tell him I'm sorry.

110
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,360
Don't worry. You will be fine.

111
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,860
♫  Do you feel regret?  ♫

112
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,680
♫  Forget him  ♫

113
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,590
♫  Wipe away the tears and send him away  ♫

114
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,940
♫  Like two parallel lines we will not be concerned 
 about each other again  ♫

115
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,950
♫  The ruins of time  ♫

116
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,700
♫  Turn into a one-person lonely island  ♫

117
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,250
♫  Commemorate those years of struggle  ♫

118
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,700
♫  And the road he had lighted but had no time to walk on  ♫

119
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,940
 Will Li Xun regret it? 

120
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,740
 I can answer for him. 

121
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,430
 No. 

122
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,440
 At least he'll never admit it. 

123
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,540
 He was so lonely for the first half of his life. 

124
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,540
 He was pretty much alone by himself 

125
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,860
 and as stubborn as a stone. 

126
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,820
 He seldom admits mistakes, 

127
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,580
 so how can he say regret and negate the road he had taken? 

128
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,680
♫  Everything is light red, light red  ♫

129
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,520
♫  Light red, us  ♫

130
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,870
Gao Jianhong's operation was successful.

131
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,180
Make up with them.

132
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,960
Go talk to them.

133
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,310
I'm not going.

134
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay.

135
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,100
♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

136
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,600
I want the name of L &amp; P.

137
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay.

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,080
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

139
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,500
 He will use another method to express his feelings. 

140
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,000
 I have always believed that his heart was soft 

141
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,800
 and it will become softer and softer. 

142
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,900
 Like a grown-up child, 

143
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,200
 or a ripe peach, 

144
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,000
 he'll become increasingly sweet and gentle. 

145
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,800
Party A, L &amp; P Company, shall pay a total compensation of ¥55,000,000 to Party B's 13 companies

146
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,700
including My Heart Flying Company,

147
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,700
and shall transfer the company name, Jili in Chinese and L&amp;P in English,

148
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,400
and related trademarks to My Heart Flying Network Co., Ltd.

149
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,100
Party A and Party B guarantee to keep confidential the information

150
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,400
that can not be obtained from public channels

151
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
during the negotiation, signing, and implementation of this agreement.

152
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,900
Thank you for agreeing to a settlement.

153
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,600
Old Gao also agreed to it.

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
He has been doing rehabilitation these past days.

155
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,900
He is more active than anyone else.

156
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,500
He doesn't want to come.

157
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,900
Maybe he doesn't want to face it.

158
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,700
This is a joint decision of all clients.

159
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,300
We are a small company. We need to consider the future.

160
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,700
If the consumption is too high, the loss will outweigh the gain.

161
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,100
We all know there are no joint decisions.

162
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,630
Only Li Xun can make a decision from beginning to end.

163
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,100
No matter if it's due to past friendship or sympathy, I'm grateful to him.

164
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,500
At least Old Gao's efforts can be kept partially.

165
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,620
   

166
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,290
   

167
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,600
What are you thinking about?

168
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,700
Everyone in this building doesn't know what L &amp; P really means.

169
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,700
They don't know how much passion and ideals were contained

170
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,300
and the days of struggle in this name.

171
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,100
You're emotional.

172
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
Sometimes I really envy you and Li Xun.

173
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,900
At your age, you can still fight to the end for a name.

174
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,200
I really can't compete with you in your persistence.

175
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Look.

176
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,700
Still so handsome.

177
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's go. We've signed it. Let's go eat lunch.

178
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
Okay.

179
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,500
Someone just said you were still handsome.

180
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,700
You did?

181
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,200
Let's go.

182
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,100
Brother Teng, this is all yours.

183
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,800
Put it in.

184
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,400
Somewhat…

185
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,900
Look.

186
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,700
An earlier picture.

187
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,900
Xiaojian.

188
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,600
I just put two new rolls of paper in the toilet.

189
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,600
- Don't forget to pack them. 
 - Unbelievable.

190
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,500
Our company is just to be redecorated.

191
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,800
Who will take your little shit?

192
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,500
Listen, Fang.

193
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,200
If you still keep your habit of being mean,

194
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
you really won't be able to find a wife.

195
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,930
You guys earn income and I cut down expense. Right?

196
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,700
We should finish our tasks to make our company bigger and stronger.

197
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,500
Isn't that the truth?

198
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,800
Brother Fang, it's unnecessary.

199
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,600
The handsome Group Leader Li is here.

200
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
He can earn enough money for you.

201
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,900
Is it necessary for you to save money?

202
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,000
That Jiang Lang also has a day when his talents are exhausted.

203
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
Don't you have to be prepared for danger in times of peace?

204
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,600
I really don't plan on doing it.

205
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,700
You see, it's over!

206
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,900
Now, Li Xun announces several things.

207
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,500
The first thing.

208
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,700
Zhu Yun and I are not going to develop games anymore.

209
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,600
We will leave it to Zhao Teng.

210
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Shouldn't you discuss this with me?

211
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,900
Second, our company will change its name...

212
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,300
to L &amp; P.

213
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Every one of you is an original shareholder.

214
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,190
- Really? 
 - Yes.

215
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,800
Shareholder?

216
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,300
Finally.

217
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,800
L &amp; P will still be under the management of Mr. Dong.

218
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,100
Okay, this is great.

219
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Wait for a while.

220
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,200
The second thing. The second one. What does it mean?

221
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,700
Shareholder?

222
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,500
- I, we, all of us are shareholders? 
 - Yes.

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,300
- I-I'm getting rich? 
 - Yeah.

224
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm getting rich! This meal is on me today,

225
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,100
Xiaojian, burn my two rolls of paper to celebrate it!

226
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm also a shareholder.

227
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Mr. Dong's library is gone.

228
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,700
Buy a new one.

229
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,400
We are a game company with a current income of more than 100 million yuan.

230
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Finally, we can have ice pops whenever we want.

231
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,700
Think about it.

232
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,200
Not long after Group Leaders Li and Zhu came here,

233
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,600
we have already become rich.

234
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,800
What do you think we can be in three years?

235
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,400
Let me start.

236
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
My plan is after I come back

237
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,100
from studying abroad three years later,

238
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,900
I want to give my girlfriend an unforgettable wedding.

239
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,800
Then I will go abroad and marry a girlfriend.

240
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
That's hard.

241
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Mr. Dong.

242
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,700
Buy a private plane and apply for a pilot's licence.

243
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,300
You're going to carry passengers with a plane?

244
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
No traffic jams.

245
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,600
It's not difficult.

246
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,100
This is just the beginning of the big talk.

247
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,100
How about you, Group Leader Zhu?

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
You.

249
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,500
I think the courier at the door is too noisy.

250
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
You want to give him a yellow card.

251
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,600
He puts too much stuff every time and everybody wants it to move.

252
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,300
Actually, it's not difficult.

253
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,100
Half a year later, this floor will be ours.

254
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,300
Excuse me.

255
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,400
Is this My Heart Flying Network Company?

256
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
Zhu Yun.

257
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,200
Well, Yun.

258
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,700
I heard that Xiuzhu has returned to France for an exhibition.

259
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,900
Why didn't you tell us?

260
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Dad. Mom.

261
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
I do have something to tell you.

262
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,600
No hurry.

263
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,500
Let's go home first.

264
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,100
We should have a good chat.

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,300
Why don't you close the door?

266
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,000
Is it necessary?

267
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Anyone can enter your house, right?

268
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,900
When did he come out?

269
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
A long time ago.

270
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,700
He came to you as soon as he was released?

271
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,100
No. I went to find him.

272
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,600
Why did you do that?

273
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
How long were you going to keep this from me and your father?

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,300
Mom, let's talk in peace.

275
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,000
The time when I returned home to apply for a visa,

276
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
he was released and I came across him.

277
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,600
I didn't intend to stay.

278
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,600
But then I learned that the company we founded together was taken away.

279
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,100
So I decided to stay and start a business with him to take back the company.

280
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Xiuzhu also knows about this.

281
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,000
He didn't hold a painting exhibition here.

282
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
Great.

283
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,300
So you guys worked together to cheat us.

284
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,000
You are really able.

285
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,700
Now you know it.

286
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,600
We're together again.

287
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
Zhu Yun...

288
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,800
Let me tell you.

289
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,400
I don't agree with you.

290
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Your father won't agree.

291
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,100
We disagreed a long time ago.

292
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,600
We won't agree in the future. We'll never agree!

293
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,300
Who is he?

294
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,700
He was in prison.

295
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,100
This is a lifelong stain for him! He can't get rid of it.

296
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,000
We were all wrong back then.

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,200
But everyone paid the price.

298
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,500
Li Xun is really extreme sometimes.

299
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
But he's already changing.

300
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,700
Leopards can't change their spots, you know.

301
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,500
How much can he change?

302
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
- You're right. 
 - Now that you know...

303
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,500
He just can't change the firmness in his bones,

304
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,400
no matter how long it has been,

305
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,300
I still fall in love with him so easily.

306
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,700
You what?

307
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,300
You were brainwashed by him.

308
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
You are Zhu Yun's father?

309
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,400
Let's have a chat.

310
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,900
I heard Yun mention you.

311
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,800
That means she's been working for you for this period of time?

312
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,500
Your daughter is my boss now.

313
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,800
She works for herself.

314
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,700
What's your point?

315
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,600
I want to talk about them two kids.

316
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,300
Talk about the children?

317
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,800
Do you have kids?

318
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
No. I'm single.

319
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,300
No wonder.

320
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,500
Then maybe you can't understand the parents' heart to their children.

321
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,000
To be honest, Yun's mother is indeed a little emotional.

322
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,960
But we do so for her.

323
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,720
We don't want her to take detours so that she won't feel wronged again.

324
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,080
I don't like this.

325
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,980
Your daughter dates Li Xun, which is a detour and will make her fell wronged?

326
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,130
You are bullying Li Xun who has no grown-ups to support him?

327
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,140
So you are here to support Li Xun?

328
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,100
Yeah.

329
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,280
Today, I want to represent him as his elder to chat with you.

330
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,520
Okay, tell me.

331
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,280
What's good and special about Li Xun?

332
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,130
I'll just mention one thing.

333
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,910
If it weren't for Li Xun, my broken company would have collapsed long ago.

334
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,430
Does this count as an outstanding and special place for Li Xun?

335
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,110
Go on.

336
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,470
Brother, it's hard for them to be together.

337
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:35,070
You know your girl can't let Li Xun go. Right?

338
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,440
What's this called? It's called obsession.

339
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,130
You should know your girl's character better than I do.

340
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,330
Can you two stop them in this way?

341
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,710
Besides. Who didn't make mistakes when they were young?

342
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,580
You can't hold on to Li Xun forever because of one mistake.

343
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,240
This is called unreasonable.

344
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,700
I agree with you on this point.

345
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,250
Indeed, Li Xun is a...

346
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,100
very special kid who does not play cards according to common sense.

347
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,540
But often it's this genius who's half the devil incarnate.

348
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,490
I think you, you are great.

349
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,490
You can be persuaded.

350
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,090
But it's no use telling me this.

351
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,210
You have to go up and talk to your wife.

352
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,340
No, no, no.

353
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,000
When I go up, it'll really become a big accident scene.

354
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,760
Why do we talk about this here?

355
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,820
Actually, to tell the truth, I think...

356
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,740
it's up to them to make a decision.

357
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,560
I love that.

358
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,140
It will take a while for them.

359
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,850
There is a noodle shop nearby. The noodles with sweet and sour pork ribs are very good.

360
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,440
Let me buy you a bowl of noodles.

361
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,740
How do you know I like sweet and sour pork noodles?

362
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,750
You really love it?

363
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,830
Let's go.

364
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,390
Go.

365
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,940
You're not welcome here.

366
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,230
I want to talk to my daughter about something.

367
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,270
You don't want to come in and listen, right?

368
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,890
Mom.

369
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,850
I'll save you face today.

370
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,100
But I hope you can stop.

371
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,820
I won't let my daughter be with you.

372
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,260
Mom, this is our home. You have no right to interfere.

373
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
You have no right to make the decisions.

374
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,210
Zhu Yun.

375
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,520
I gave birth to you and raised you.

376
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,330
Today, you say I have no rights?

377
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,940
Aunt.

378
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,480
You can put forward any conditions.

379
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,120
My condition is that you don't appear in front of our eyes again.

380
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,140
My daughter has been good, clever, and sensible since childhood.

381
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,470
But since she has been with you, she seems to be bewitched by you.

382
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,330
Do you know how you tortured our family?

383
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,020
Mom, if you have this attitude, we can't talk anymore.

384
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,950
Then we won't talk.

385
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,180
I'm not here to chat with you.

386
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,390
I don't want to quarrel with you.

387
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,560
But I'm telling you exactly.

388
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,860
This is our only daughter.

389
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,670
We don't want her to marry you.

390
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,460
Aunt.

391
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,770
You are Zhu Yun's mother.

392
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,460
I have to listen to everything you say whether I want to or not

393
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,670
I just said...

394
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,150
you can put forward any conditions.

395
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,350
I will try my best to satisfy them.

396
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:40,040
We are not that kind of snobby and unreasonable family.

397
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,870
Our requirements for a future son-in-law

398
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:50,220
is that as long as he has a happy family

399
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,870
that is equal in social status to us.

400
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,360
My daughter never made any mistakes since childhood.

401
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,840
Her husband should be clean as well.

402
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,920
That's not too much, right?

403
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,620
If you can do something to clean up the stains on your file

404
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,100
and invite your parents to sit together with us to talk it over.

405
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,530
I think I can agree.

406
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,380
What's your opinion?

407
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,690
Aunt.

408
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,630
Zhu Yun has the ability to change the world.

409
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,900
You just want her to obey you.

410
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,460
You, you.

411
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,340
What did you say?

412
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,730
It depends on you, Dad.

413
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,110
I will try.

414
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,660
Are you hungry?

415
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,310
There is a good noodle restaurant nearby.

416
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,380
I'll treat you.

417
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,930
You didn't leave?

418
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,800
I have been here all the time.

419
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,050
Your mother is so good and forthright, why was her daughter so timid?

420
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,070
I wasn't timid.

421
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,590
But don't blame her.

422
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,040
She has been a teacher for decades. This is her thinking inertia.

423
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,250
I apologize to you for her.

424
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,680
Princess,

425
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,090
you take me as a fragile doll again.

426
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,480
It's not a problem.

427
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,310
We have a lifetime to convince her.

428
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,230
What are you reading?

429
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,420
That book you gave me.

430
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,050
Is it nice?

431
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,580
Not bad.

432
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,880
Zhu Yun.

433
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,310
Why don't we do something practical?

434
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,840
What do you mean?

435
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,730
If you want a massage, just say it.

436
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,740
That arm.

437
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,360
- It's over? 
 - Your hand.

438
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,250
Have you finished it?

439
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,000
Is there a reward?

440
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,030
Reward?

441
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,460
- You even ask for a reward? 
 - I'm ticklish.

442
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,150
Reward.

443
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,290
Li Xun.

444
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,010
Let's have a baby.

445
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,080
You want to use a child against your mother?

446
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,720
It has nothing to do with this.

447
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,950
Then, why do you suddenly want to have a baby?

448
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,450
I want the baby to accompany you.

449
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,860
You're one and a half years older than me.

450
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,470
You're almost thirty.

451
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,350
It's the right age.

452
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,190
But it still depends on you.

453
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,220
We just got together and your career is not stable.

454
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,040
Most importantly, we're not married.

455
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,130
We have no birth permit.

456
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,780
Forget it

457
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,960
Forget it?

458
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,640
Why leave it like that?

459
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,200
I want a baby too. Let's have one.

460
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,510
- Really? 
 - Yes.

461
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,440
- That's it? 
 - That's it.

462
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,940
Go somewhere with me tomorrow.

463
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,450
I'm leaving then.

464
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,320
If you need anything, please contact me.

465
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,980
Okay.

466
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,240
This house is…

467
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,630
I bought it.

468
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,020
You bought this place?

469
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,820
Or why did I bring you here?

470
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,730
You didn't come to work the day before yesterday and yesterday because you were buying a house?

471
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,680
That's quite a speedy deal.

472
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,010
How much did it cost?

473
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,600
Why do you ask how much?

474
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,590
I don't trust you in spending money.

475
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,370
Are you applying for a loan or borrowing money from others?

476
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,280
I borrowed from a loan shark.

477
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,170
I borrowed money from Ren Di.

478
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,800
Would you like to visit it?

479
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,040
Show me around.

480
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,730
Okay.

481
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,630
Zhu Yun.

482
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,220
I've always had no idea about family.

483
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,600
I think marriage...

484
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,320
is just a long love.

485
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,830
The most important thing in love is to be happy.

486
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,030
I don't want you to sacrifice a lot. I hope you are happy...

487
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,520
when staying with me.

488
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,920
And what about you?

489
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,260
Are you happy with me?

490
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,940
It's not bad.

491
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,640
So can I take the last sentence as a proposal?

492
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,220
Zhu Yun,

493
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,660
we need to do something meaningful together.

494
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,250
- Don't you want to ask what it is? 
 - What's it?

495
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,300
   

496
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,490
Excuse me? Are you here to get married?

497
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,790
Of course.

498
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,820
All of you?

499
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,440
- Yes.  
 - Yes.

500
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,470
- Get away. 
 - No. No.

501
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,850
They came with us.

502
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,440
You have many family members.

503
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,410
Only the couple can come in for a bit. Everyone else has to wait outside.

504
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,550
Please show me your family registration book and ID card.

505
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,700
Let's go.

506
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,930
Okay, just a moment, please.

507
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,920
- Are you nervous? 
 - Yes.

508
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,390
You still have time to regret.

509
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,340
I'll go in later. You can't rob this chance, okay?

510
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,040
- All right? 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay.

511
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,330
- You are quite nervous? 
 - I...

512
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,870
- You're not married yet. 
 - Let go.

513
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,130
But having said that, you are dressed too casually to receive your registration.

514
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,200
Look at us.

515
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,250
- Yeah, we are dressed up. 
 - Yes.

516
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,770
Look. We are all dressed up.

517
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,920
It hasn't been washed yet.

518
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,350
What?

519
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,180
Shirt. No.

520
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,500
It's no use if your mother comes.

521
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,290
It's legal.

522
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,720
Look at the camera.

523
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,180
You two... stand closer.

524
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile.

525
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,090
Smile happily.

526
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,880
Li Xun, I asked you to smile, not to sneer.

527
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,800
Hurry up. I'm afraid they will come and stop us.

528
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,840
- Smile. 
 - Okay.

529
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,340
Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile.

530
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,250
Three, two, one.

531
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,180
- Come on in. 
 - Hello. Hello. Hello.

532
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,570
It's so beautiful!

533
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,730
Change your shoes. What are you doing?

534
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,470
- Should I change my shoes? 
 - No need. Just go straight in.

535
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,630
No need to change.

536
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,280
By the way, Group Leader Zhu, a lucky star shines in a good place. Smile every day.

537
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,070
I wish our dear Political Commissar Zhu happiness in her new house

538
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:43,110
Take this couple electric toothbrush as a witness of your love.

539
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,420
What a coincidence. I just bought a pair the other day.

540
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,290
- It's also the marble black and white couple style. 
 - It's a coincidence.

541
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,630
This pair can be given to Ren Di and Liu.

542
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,240
What a coincidence.

543
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,530
- Here you are. My gift. 
 - Thank you, Mr. Dong.

544
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here you are.

545
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,630
Good luck. Thank you.

546
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,260
Congratulations to Mrs. Li.

547
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,720
- Thank you. 
 - It's too big.

548
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,470
How about you? You came empty-handed?

549
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,510
You stole my roommate and are making me pay the rent myself. And you are asking me for a gift now?

550
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,040
He is good at calculating.

551
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,920
Come and see the lake.

552
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,020
The lake looks very comfortable.

553
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,930
This is surrounded by a lake on four sides, three sides.

554
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,180
Take a seat. I'll get you some water.

555
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,160
- Do you have any drinks?
 - You can have a look.

556
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,340
It's good. Gentle winds blow.

557
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,120
- Ready? 
 - Hurry up.

558
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,060
- Okay. Hurry up. 
 - Get closer. Get closer.

559
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,210
Get ready.

560
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,340
Okay.

561
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,820
One, two, three.

562
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:53,200
 Later, our game Invincible General was ranked in the top three on the annual list. 

563
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,000
 But Dong Siyang's greatest wish was still to become a five-star driver. 

564
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,840
 Ren Di and Liu are finally engaged. 

565
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,500
 Gao Jianhong and Xu Lina exited the company's operations 

566
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,910
 and found a place to recuperate. 

567
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,260
 Fang Zhijing was reported by his company's shareholders for embezzlement... 

568
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,240
 and taken away by the police. 

569
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,880
 Sometimes I feel the world is like a battlefield. 

570
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,820
 Everyone is struggling to resist. 

571
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,960
 Some people die in battle, 

572
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,220
 some give up, and some are still fighting. 

573
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,620
 Fighting requires great strength and courage. 

574
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,830
 I don't have that much skill. 

575
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,100
 So I can only be a follower. 

576
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,970
 But he does. 

577
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,270
Is it good to be married?

578
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:09,700
Yeah. People said marriage is the tomb of love.

579
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,120
I can't see it.

580
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,650
There is a saying.

581
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,560
"If time could stop at the moment when we first met."

582
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,450
 If time could stop at the moment when we first met. 

583
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,700
 If people really could look back on their lives 

584
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,100
 on their deathbed, 

585
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,510
 she... 

586
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,800
 may be the last person I see in my life. 

587
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,130
♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

588
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,180
♫  And have passed through the dark night  ♫

589
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,640
♫  In the crowd in the dim light  ♫

590
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,180
♫  You're over there with the fireworks  ♫

591
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,500
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

592
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,220
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

593
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,380
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

594
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:49,980
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

595
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,780
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫

596
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,240
♫  True love will take its course ♫

597
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,540
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

598
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,020
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

599
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,580
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

600
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:17,040
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

601
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,420
♫  That hot firework  ♫

602
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:31,120
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

603
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:43,940
   

604
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,540
   

605
00:44:50,100 --> 00:45:00,000


606
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:13,240
♫  The laughter reminds me of my flowers  ♫

607
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,260
♫  Quietly blooming for me  ♫

608
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,540
♫  In every corner of my life  ♫

609
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:29,860
♫  I thought I would always be by their side  ♫

610
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:37,520
♫  But today we have left in a sea of people  ♫

611
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,780
♫  I think they're getting old  ♫

612
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:46,260
♫  Where are they?  ♫

613
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:54,720
♫  We just went our separate ways  ♫

614
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,540
♫  Lalalala, lalalala  ♫

♫  Lalalala, lalalala  ♫

617
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,220

♫  Lalalala, lalalala  ♫

619

♫  Lalala, go  ♫

620
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,500
♫  They have been blown away by the wind  ♫

621
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,120
♫  And scattered toward the horizon  ♫

622
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,480
♫  Some stories haven't been finished  ♫

623
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,460
♫  But forget it  ♫

624
00:46:52,460 --> 00:47:00,940
♫  It's hard to tell those feelings in the years  ♫

625
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:09,160
♫  Now it's overgrown with grass and no flowers  ♫

626
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,920
♫  Luckily, I had seen you throughout four seasons  ♫
