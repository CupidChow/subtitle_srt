1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:15,950


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,200
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,420
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,260
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,720
   

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,460
Lina, I have something to talk to talk to you about.

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,760
What is it?

24
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,550
Only you can help me.

25
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,350
What's wrong?

26
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,470
What happened?

27
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,780
The turnover of Li Xun's Blind Box of Love has exceeded ten million.

28
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,540
Several major investment organizations have started to contact them.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,460
And it's just the beginning.

30
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,300
Exceeding ten million doesn't sound like a big deal.

31
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,900
It's not a big deal now,

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,420
but the market trend is very dangerous.

33
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,890
Once they have money, we won't have products to fight with them.

34
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,940
As you know, I can't hack into their company's network.

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,200
So what do you want me to do?

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,090
Get the game source code of Blind Box of Love.

37
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,960
How?

38
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,780
You still have a chance to get close to Li Xun. Right?

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,140
Everything you did today was so you could get me to steal the code?

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,330
Lina, we're on the same boat. I'm not doing this for myself.

41
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,590
I can't watch him rise without doing anything.

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,870
You know how cruel Li Xun is.

43
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,490
He will seize every chance to bring down L &amp; P, and he won't let me go.

44
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,390
As long as he doesn't let me go, we will lose everything.

45
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,540
Lina.

46
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,190
You make me sick.

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,390
You also hate him, don't you?

48
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,830
You also want to see him fail. And you want to see him beg me for mercy, right?

49
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,300
It hurts. Let go.

50
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,020
Or are you reluctant to do it?

51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,150
No, I'm not.

52
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,080
You...

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,630
You have been thinking about Li Xun, haven't you?

54
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,290
It's such a good chance.

55
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,580
I'll send you to his side. I'll send you to his side.

56
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,300
Are you insane?

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,900
Do you know what you are saying?

58
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,220
Stop pretending in front of me.

59
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,080
You just can't wait to do that.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,950
You can't wait to start a relationship with him.

61
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,350
You can't wait to have an affair with him.

62
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,710
You've thought about it a million times.

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,820
I... Why did I marry you?

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,720
You regret it?

65
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,730
Of course, you regret it.

66
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,670
You never loved me.

67
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,420
You only love my money.

68
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,710
I helped clean up the mess made by your father,

69
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,570
so how could you marry me?

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,980
I married you...

71
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,460
because I thought you were still who you were six years ago.

72
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,150
I thought you were still the boy whose eyes twinkled

73
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,670
when he talked about Blue Crown APP.

74
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,370
I'm telling you.

75
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,670
I, Xu Lina, have never met a woman who loves money the most.

76
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,280
I won't do this for you.

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,960
Don't force me.

78
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,540
I force you?

79
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,280
Li Xun forces me! You all force me!

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,680
Let's get a divorce. Okay?

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
What did you say?

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,470
Divorce.

83
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,560
Gao Jianhong, you have lost.

84
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,200
Lina...

85
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,580
I agree to the divorce.

86
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,960
Do as I said and you can have your freedom.

87
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,990
Why did you ask me to come here?

88
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,910
Come in.

89
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,090
Have a seat.

90
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,820
What would you like to drink?

91
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,970
No need.

92
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,200
Coffee, okay?

93
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,970
Just get straight to the point.

94
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,780
L &amp; P will be listed soon.

95
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,810
Do you know?

96
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,490
So?

97
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,310
So, you can't beat Gao.

98
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,270
You want to persuade us to give up?

99
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,930
No, I want cooperation.

100
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,140
Hello?

101
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,280
 Who let you go to meet Xu Lina? 

102
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,690
It's strange.

103
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,360
Xu Lina suddenly asked me to come to her this morning.

104
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,130
She said for us to give up the confrontation and work with Gao Jianhong to develop Blind Box of Love.

105
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,390
How?

106
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,720
Gao Jianhong will never work with us.

107
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,980
There must be some tricks behind this.

108
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,360
I also think it's abnormal, but I don't know what exactly is abnormal.

109
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,380
Well, leave her alone.

110
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,980
Come back to the company. We've got good news.

111
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,280
 What good news? 

112
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,190
You'll know after you come back.

113
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,210
"Congratulations to you for winning the Network Industry Development Government Award

114
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,520
with your online game Invincible General.

115
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,520
You are invited to Network Industry Development Award Ceremony.

116
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,740
This signature is also the Network Industry Development Association of Information Industry Department."

117
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,670
So it's a government award.

118
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,490
There isn't such a government association.

119
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,830
I think it's like cheating us out of the membership fee.

120
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,910
It doesn't say we need to pay any fee.

121
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,900
Wait. Look.

122
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
There is really such an award.

123
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,710
Network Industry Development Association is a subordinate to the Information Industry Department.

124
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,160
Network Industry Development Government Award is a new award established in 2019

125
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,510
to encourage innovation in internet technology.

126
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,310
This is its official website.

127
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,290
Is big data credible?

128
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,840
It's true.

129
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,960
It's the first session for this award.

130
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,820
There are three places for the game awards, and we won one of them.

131
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,880
And our game is the only mobile game.

132
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,710
Good.

133
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,430
I still can't believe it.

134
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,140
Professor Zhao Guowei recommended it.

135
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,340
Well, I don't mean this.

136
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,120
I mean, this year, you developed one game each.

137
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,450
We made a fortune with the game you developed.

138
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,850
And we won an award for this game.

139
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,460
So we've gained both fame and fortune.

140
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,440
Does it mean that I can count on you to have everything I want in the future?

141
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,650
- You can think that way. 
 - We'll make money.

142
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,490
Don't be complacent. Have you found the person I asked you to recruit?

143
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,060
Yes, I have. I'm printing it for you.

144
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,550
Look.

145
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,860
Many companies have been invited to the ceremony.

146
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,150
My Heart Flying Network Company, Shuxingyu, Games of Tomorrow,

147
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,190
L &amp; P, and Dandelion.

148
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,120
Quite a few companies.

149
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,550
Are we going?

150
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,660
Yes.

151
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,120
We have to go, and we need to be gorgeously dressed.

152
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,900
Where are they?

153
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,600
They have set out to attend the ceremony.

154
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,190
Oh, God. It's 1:00. Why didn't you remind me?

155
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Let's go.

156
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,500
Are you going to the ceremony wearing this?

157
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,000
What's the problem?

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,400
As the only female employee, you should keep up our company's appearance.

159
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,200
I've been updating Invincible General the whole day.

160
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,400
And there's a heavy traffic jam now. I don't have enough time.

161
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
What's this?

162
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 Such bad taste. 

163
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,600
   
   

164
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
- Hello. Hello. 
 -  This way, please.

165
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,100
Please. Please.

166
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,300
Be careful.

167
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,000
Get closer.

168
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,900
Look here. Good.

169
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,700
Smile.

170
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,100
- You have never attended a ceremony? 
 - Well, I'm a bit nervous.

171
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
I... I... I...

172
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,700
Where are my glasses?

173
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,800
Is this the upper class?

174
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,400
- Why doesn't anyone take photos of us? 
 - I'll take photos for you. Give me your phone.

175
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,700
I... Come on. Come on.

176
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Come on. Take a group photo.

177
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Fang... Fang... Fang... Please squat. My legs will look longer in that case.

178
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,200
Who's this?

179
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
Oh, my god.

180
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Is this Political Commissar Zhu?

181
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,500
I don't think she is.

182
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,100
Go. Go. Let's go inside. Let's go inside.

183
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,700
Go. Go, go.

184
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm still a bit nervous.

185
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,200
 Hello. Please look at the camera. 

186
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
After Group Leader Zhu and Group Leader Li come, what do we look like?

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,100
Bodyguards.

188
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Good. Pretty good.

189
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
 Good. Smile. 

190
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,300
Go. Go, go.

191
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,500
I'm nervous.

192
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,600
Don't be nervous.

193
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
The leaders are coming.

194
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,900
Now let's invite leaders and guests on the stage to take a group photo.

195
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,000
Act decently. Take a group photo.

196
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Okay. Thank you.

197
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,500
Three leaders, please go back to your seats.

198
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Leaders go back to their seats.

199
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Leaders go back to their seats.

200
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,300
- Come on. Take it. 
 - Yeah. Go. Go. Go.

201
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,600
- Congratulations. 
 - This award...

202
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,800
I want to thank the organizing committee for giving us this award.

203
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,600
This honor belongs to every employee of My Heart Flying Network Company.

204
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 Good. 

205
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,300
It belongs to every entrepreneur.

206
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,200
 Good. 

207
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:10,200
I believe this is only the beginning of the brilliance My Heart Flying Network Company.

208
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,900
 Good! 

209
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Mr. Li Xun, is there anyone in particular who you would like to thank?

210
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I do especially want to thank someone.

211
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,000
That's Gao Jianhong, the CEO of L&amp;P.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,900
Mr. Gao.

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,100
I decided to join My Heart Flying Network Company

214
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,400
here at the site of the internet conference

215
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,500
because of Mr. Gao.

216
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,100
Unexpectedly, I can accept an award here today.

217
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
What a surprise.

218
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Invincible General wins an award.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Today, I would like to ask Mr. Gao.

220
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,200
How is your Rivalry Among Seven Powers?

221
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
As we know, something copied can't survive for long.

222
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
Chinese companies in the internet industry have made so much money.

223
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,200
But if we analyze the internal structure carefully,

224
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,700
we will find that such companies have few cutting-edge technologies.

225
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,000
We don't hope that Chinese internet companies still rely on entertainment,

226
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
services and sales of cheap products to make money

227
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,800
10 or 20 years later.

228
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,200
Mr. Li Xun, internet startups have met with a chilly winter of financing since last year.

229
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,400
Recently, My Heart Flying Network Company became the target that investors are chasing.

230
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,800
But I heard that you turned them down.

231
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Why?

232
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,400
They all want to invest in games.

233
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,900
But your company is a game company.

234
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,700
It is now, but it won't be a game company only.

235
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,500
So, what's the development direction of your company?

236
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,600
Online medical care.

237
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,100
 I hope that the survival rate of cancer will be increased by 1%. 

238
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,000
♫  Do you feel regret?  ♫

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,800
♫  Forget him  ♫

240
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,600
♫  Wipe away the tears and send him away  ♫

241
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,100
The path we choose to take is not easy.

242
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,270
I'm afraid many small investors can't afford to lose.

243
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,010
So our standard for choosing investors is to put quality before quantity.

244
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,350
Those who trust you...

245
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,400
will always trust you.

246
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,900
♫  And the road he had lighted but had no time to walk on  ♫

247
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,600
♫  Light red, farewell  ♫

248
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,000
♫  Regretfully is left in the season when leaves fall  ♫

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,880
I believe...

250
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
in this industry,

251
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,100
some are responsible for providing convenience,

252
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,300
some provide entertainment consumption,

253
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,900
but some need to

254
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,500
be responsible for changing the era.

255
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,400
♫  At dusk in light red, don't ask who was here  ♫

256
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,800
♫  Everything is light red, light red  ♫

257
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,700
♫  Light red us  ♫

258
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,300
This game succeeded because I have some capable helpers.

259
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,500
Who are they?

260
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't know them.

261
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,300
They seem to have been hungry for years.

262
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Drink more.

263
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,200
Would you like to drink some?

264
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,000
Where's Li Xun?

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
I don't see him.

266
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,700
- What is he doing? 
 - I don't know.

267
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,100
I'm taking you somewhere. Go. Go, go.

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,800
I played your game Blind Box of Love. It's good.

269
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,800
Did you? This game's users are usually lonesome nerds.

270
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,100
You have a special taste.

271
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Did you ask him to leave because you want to say something to me?

272
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,500
You have something to say to me.

273
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,600
In fact, I knew about the cooperation between Old Gao and Fang Zhijing later.

274
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Old Gao never let me get involved in L &amp; P's business.

275
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,700
But honestly, when you were in prison,

276
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,400
Old Gao did operate L &amp; P very well.

277
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,000
He has always wanted to...

278
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
prove himself to you.

279
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
But I think...

280
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,100
L &amp; P...

281
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,800
will eventually belong to you.

282
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Why?

283
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,000
Because he only wants to make money,

284
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and only wants to prove himself to you.

285
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,300
He doesn't have any lofty ideals.

286
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,500
So these years, he has gotten more and more anxious,

287
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,900
more and more paranoid.

288
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,900
I remember that when I first knew him, he was not like this.

289
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,100
All of our lives have changed because of you,

290
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,400
only you never changed.

291
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,800
When you stood on the stage just now, I was a bit confused.

292
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
I thought...

293
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
we were still in college.

294
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,600
Are you jealous?

295
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,300
You deserve it. I'm telling you.

296
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Later, more and more women will show up around Li Xun.

297
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,500
You'll regret it.

298
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,200
Don't mess up our plan.

299
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,200
- What plan? 
 - What plan?

300
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,800
No plan.

301
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Tell me.

302
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,800
Li Xun is going to give him the source code.

303
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,000
But he can't give it to him directly. So we needed a plan.

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,100
What were you chatting about?

305
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
About the past.

306
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
You can't forget your old love?

307
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
It's good that you haven't forgotten him.

308
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,100
Remember to get the source code back.

309
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,100
Rest assured. I won't forget it.

310
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Don't tell Li Xun I brought you here to eavesdrop.

311
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,200
Why?

312
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Only Li Xun, Dong Siyang, and I know this.

313
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,800
Why didn't you tell me?

314
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,100
Well, do you really not know or do you pretend not to know?

315
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,700
I don't understand.

316
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,700
You and Li Xun are not together.

317
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,800
Why does he consider your mood whatever he does?

318
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,400
But you know nothing about it.

319
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,700
He is overcautious because of you.

320
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,600
You must tell me if Li Xun meets Xu Lina in the future.

321
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,200
- Are you afraid? 
 - What am I afraid of?

322
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
Do you want to be pushed down again?

323
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

324
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,900
- Mr. Gao, I haven't seen you for long. 
 - It's been a long time.

325
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Mr. Gao, congratulations.

326
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Miss Luna, you're so beautiful.

327
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,600
Come on.

328
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,400
Do you know that Gao Jianhong sent Xu Lina to you?

329
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes.

330
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Do you also know she came to steal the source code?

331
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
I told you, I will force him to copy.

332
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,200
Xu Lina came to talk to me because he has no other way.

333
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,100
Group Leader Zhu, you are still working.

334
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,200
Why are you here?

335
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
Why don't you keep an eye on L &amp; P in the computer room?

336
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,500
Well... Why did I come here?

337
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,900
- Where's Li Xun? 
 - He has gone home.

338
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,000
Why did you come here?

339
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,700
Why did I come here?

340
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,200
I'm going home.

341
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,700
Why are you taking a pillow with you?

342
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Well...

343
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,600
Do you want to sleep in the storage room to make room for Li Xun?

344
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Is he with Xu Lina?

345
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,500
When you accepted the award on the stage that day,

346
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,800
I thought we were...

347
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,800
at the information security contest for a moment.

348
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,300
I remember that the judge asked you

349
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,200
about the reason,

350
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,400
and you said...

351
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Because of love.

352
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
It's the past.

353
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,100
Yeah.

354
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
It's all in the past.

355
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
I'll send you home.

356
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
No, I don't want to go home.

357
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,100
Waiter.

358
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Let's play a game.

359
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
What game?

360
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Let's play a game of lies.

361
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,500
We'll ask each other questions,

362
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,800
but when we answer, we have to tell lies.

363
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
What do you think?

364
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,600
You ask me first.

365
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,900
I don't have any question.

366
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,100
Then I'll ask myself questions.

367
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
The first question.

368
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,400
Why did I marry Gao Jianhong?

369
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Of course, it was...

370
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,500
because of love.

371
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,100
The second question.

372
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Were happy these years?

373
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,900
Of course, I was happy.

374
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,600
I have a lot of bags

375
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,400
and several hundred beautiful shoes.

376
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Old Gao also gave me a necklace with very large diamonds.

377
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
My closet is bigger than your room...

378
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
No, bigger than your house.

379
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,900
Of course, I have been living a happy life.

380
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,400
The third question.

381
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,900
If the person I loved back then appeared again,

382
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,100
what would I do?

383
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,400
I would tell him...

384
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,600
I am doing good and living a happy life.

385
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,900
I would tell him...

386
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,800
his appearance does not affect me at all,

387
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,800
and I still can live a good life with peace.

388
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,500
I'm sorry. I got drunk.

389
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,100
I'm going.

390
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,500
Do you know that if you give it to Gao Jianhong,

391
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,800
you will also be held accountable?

392
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,200
You knew what I came for, right?

393
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
Of course, you knew.

394
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,200
Since you knew what I came for,

395
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,100
the source code inside is a trap you set for Gao Jianhong.

396
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,500
Right?

397
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
I'd better give it to Gao Jianhong.

398
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
You may choose not to do it.

399
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
You don't need to help me.

400
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,100
I'm not helping you, but helping myself.

401
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,400
When you planned all this,

402
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,700
did you ever consider me?

403
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,200
Xu Lina.

404
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,800
I owe you an apology.

405
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,100
I can't owe you another apology.

407
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,600
You don't owe me anything.

408
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,200
Everything I did is aboveboard.

409
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,600
I quite envy you and Zhu Yun.

410
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,800
You haven't changed.

411
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,400
These years, many things have changed.

412
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,400
I also want to keep something unchanged for myself.

413
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm going.

414
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
Bye-bye.

415
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
Goodbye.

416
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,400
 Where are you? 

417
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
 I'm at home. 

418
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,400
Hello?

419
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,600
 Where are you? 

420
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,400
I'm at home.

421
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,600
Hello?

422
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,500
- Hello? 
 - Hello?

423
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,200
Aren't you at home?

424
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Are you here for an inspection, Political Commissar Zhu?

425
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,100
Did you give her the source code?

426
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,600
Yes.

427
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,700
What did you do?

428
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,600
We just did something we could do.

429
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,970
Rest assured.

430
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,720
I advised her not to take such a risk that might harm herself.

431
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,350
But she has her own considerations.

432
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,910
What should we do next?

433
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,070
Get ready for a lawsuit.

434
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,650
I've done what you asked me to do.

435
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,450
When will you do the thing you promised me?

436
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,320
This is the divorce agreement. I have signed it.

437
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,040
   

438
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,130
You aren't even going to look at the contents of the USB drive?

439
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,670
I trust you. You said it's the source code, and it is.

440
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,250
But you don't trust me.

441
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
Is that so simple?

442
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,970
It's just so simple.

443
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,390
The family money has always been in your account.

444
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,460
Just take it as my compensation for you.

445
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,780
You can sell your shares in the company to me after the company is listed.

446
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,980
Then you will have money to pay off your father's debts.

447
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,110
So you won't be dragged by him and do things you don't want to do.

448
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,860
And this house and the apartment in Jiangbei are under your name.

449
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,050
I will move out as soon as possible.

450
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,150
You don't need to do this.

451
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,590
These things belong to you.

452
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,800
I never wanted you to give them to me.

453
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,040
You never asked me for anything.

454
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,500
And you didn't steal the source code.

455
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,110
Li Xun gave it to you, and I stole it from your bag.

456
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,770
If Li Xun gets you involved,

457
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,370
you will say I forced you and threatened you to do it.

458
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,150
But in order to ensure your safety,

459
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,510
I will send you abroad as soon as possible.

460
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,740
I will move out.

461
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,130
But what about you?

462
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,380
If it is found out,

463
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,320
will you be put in jail?

464
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,750
It has nothing to do with you.

465
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,840
Thank you.

466
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,340
I should have given you freedom long ago,

467
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,470
but I just didn't want to let go.

468
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,050
It's ironic.

469
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,230
When Li Xun was in prison, we married.

470
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:17,010
After Li Xun was released from prison, we divorced.

471
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,120
Lina,

472
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,350
I thought I could bring you happiness.

473
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,420
I'm sorry.

474
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,840
It seems it has worsened a lot these a few months.

475
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:05,070
At level 1, a brain glioma can be be completely removed with surgery.

476
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,130
And recovery will be good.

477
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,560
It is very difficult to have a chance of surgery if the infiltrating growth is above grade two.

478
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,940
Chemotherapy has limited effect.

479
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,220
It has grown to this position,

480
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,800
and it has been pressing against your blood vessels.

481
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,120
Did you have symptoms of hand shaking and numbness besides headache recently?

482
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,990
Yes.

483
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,870
So it can't be delayed.

484
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,680
You have to make up your mind to have surgery.

485
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,610
It takes a very long time to be hospitalized, have examinations,

486
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,880
and recover after the surgery.

487
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,620
In addition, a surgery is risky.

488
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,190
Mr. Gao, you know that risks exist in all surgeries.

489
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,300
We talked about it before.

490
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,830
Of two evils, choose the less.

491
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,300
If you don't have a surger, you will die.

492
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,870
I don't want any risk.

493
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,130
- Mr. Gao. 
 - I'm not treating it.

494
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,240
As I said,

495
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,760
I have more important things to do.

496
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,280
   

497
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,910
 Can I join the base? 

498
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,120
 it's quite difficult to find someone who is capable in the base. 

499
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,890
 I have listened to you since the very beginning of the project. 

500
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,700
 It is because you suffered a loss when you didn't listen to me. 

501
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,300
 You didn't design the app alone. 

502
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,620
 I also spent much effort on it. 

503
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,600
 I just want some respect from you. 

504
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,520
 Is it hard for you? 

505
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:52,050
 If I tell you that I treat Li Xun the same as you treat me, 

506
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,270
  and I won't give up either, 

507
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,480
will you still wait for me?

508
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,990
 I used to give up everything. 

509
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,850
 I just wanted to stay far away from you. 

510
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,890
 But you didn't even give me the chance. 

511
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,820
 - But I don't owe him. 
 - But you owe me. 

512
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,000
Gao Jianhong!

513
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,320
Li Xun, do you really think no one can defeat you?

514
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,950
   

515
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,410
 He asked you to come because he has swayed, 

516
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,950
 but I don't need it. 

517
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,260
 Since I dared do this, I have my own way to deal with him. 

518
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,870
 Do you understand? 

519
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,970
 Li Xun. 

520
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,240
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

521
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,110
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

522
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,240
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

523
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,840
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

524
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,520
♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

525
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,000
♫  I am leaning on your shoulder  ♫

526
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,040
♫  We will not separate  ♫

527
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,060
♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

528
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,600
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

529
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,640
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

530
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:03,000
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

531
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,380
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

532
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,840
♫  True love will take it's course  ♫

533
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,040
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

534
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,640
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

535
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,180
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

536
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,740
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

537
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:37,120
♫  That hot firework  ♫

538
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:47,020
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

539
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,740
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

540
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,700
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

541

♫  The clock keeps ticking without stopping for rest  ♫

544
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,760
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

545
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,080
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

546
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,580
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

547
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:39,080
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫

548
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:43,720
♫  Because I believe I love you  ♫
