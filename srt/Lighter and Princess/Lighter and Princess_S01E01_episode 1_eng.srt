00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:16,030


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,700
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,360
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,900
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,040
   

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,720
   

22
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:59,530
 Li Xun, No. 1 of Applied Technology Class 1, Computer Science Department. 

23
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,600
 Is Li Xun here? 

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
 Zhu Yun. 

25
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,400
 Betrayers shall go to hell. 

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,720
 Just consider me a betrayer. 

27
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,800
 Anyway, it's not binding to me. 

28
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,530
 It doesn't matter if I go to hell. 

29
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,500
 I'm experienced. 

30
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,120
 I've never loved you. 

31
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,450
 Li Xun! 

32
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,840
What's wrong? A nightmare?

33
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,550
Are you all right?

34
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,010
Yes.

35
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,390
Excuse me, young lady.

36
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,120
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard this airline's flight to Shanghai, China. 

37
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,310
 Our flight will take 13 hours. 

38
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,450
 We will arrive in the city in 2 hours. 

39
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,120
We're almost home. Be happy.

40
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,940
Xiuzhu, why did you come back this time?

41
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,060
I have something to do, so I came with Zhu Yun.

42
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,640
By the way, my parents asked me to bring you some gifts.

43
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,270
Thank you very much.

44
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,550
When we get our visas someday, we'll go and visit them.

45
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,170
That's great.

46
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,910
- Okay. No problem. 
 - Okay. Get in the car.

47
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,270
Okay.

48
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,060
At the end of last year,

49
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,300
another highway from Shanghai to Linyang was opened,

50
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,450
so it takes fewer hours to go back.

51
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,100
It takes only about two hours.

52
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,070
It has changed in many ways.

53
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,420
I can't recognize these places after staying abroad all these years.

54
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah.

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,660
Tell me about it.

56
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,420
Yun Yun, look. A playground will be built over there.

57
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,250
Here we are.

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,300
Finally.

59
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,540
This is great.

60
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,590
You're so nice.

61
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,130
Great.

62
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,110
Yun Yun.

63
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
Wash it, or you could get sick

64
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,250
Don't worry about it.

65
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,030
You made so many dishes.

66
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,170
What kind of relationship are you in?

67
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,500
We're friends.

68
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,170
Which kind of friends?

69
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,240
We're just simple friends.

70
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,950
What do you think?

71
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,550
What do you mean?

72
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,540
Xiuzhu often shuttles between different countries.

73
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,350
I handled my work visa all this year.

74
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,270
We seldom met.

75
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,500
You're not a little girl. You're 25 years old.

76
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,970
We have different things to do at different stages in life.

77
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,640
We should study hard in school.

78
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,710
After graduation, we should work hard and build a family.

79
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,210
Now that you have a stable job,

80
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,200
you should change your focus.

81
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,110
I think Xiuzhu has good conditions.

82
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,160
You disliked him for his poor grades.

83
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,040
That was when he was a kid.

84
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,860
I think Xiuzhu has a very gentle and considerate personality.

85
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,710
This kind of gentleness and consideration is not something that anyone can do casually.

86
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,060
   

87
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,480
Take this to the police station to get your documents.

88
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,970
   

89
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,400
♫  Don't know how you've been there  ♫

90
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,910
Keep your possessions.

91
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,290
♫  Don't know how I've been there  ♫

92
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,190
Let's go.

93
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,520
♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

94
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,980
♫  Have you ever changed?  ♫

95
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,640
♫  Don't know how you've been there  ♫

96
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,020
♫  Don't know how I've been there  ♫

97
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,260
♫  It's been so long ago  ♫

98
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,040
♫  I've been walking so long  ♫

99
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,330
This damned kettle can't boil water.

100
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,770
Owner!

101
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,860
   

102
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,550
It's noisy in this old hostel.

103
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,810
Maybe it's older than me.

104
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,970
But it's larger than a cell.

105
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,100
What are you doing?

106
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,340
I visited this company.

107
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,160
It's in a newly-decorated building downtown.

108
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,700
It's luxurious.

109
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,390
When will we go there?

110
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,610
Tomorrow.

111
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,410
What can I do for you?

112
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,120
   
 L&amp;P, a well-known game company in China, is about to go public. 

113
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,750
 We had an interview with Gao Jianhong, chairman of L&amp;P, recently. 

114
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,450
   
 We L&amp;P have been aiming for this. 

115
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,060
   
 To continuously enhance their own innovation competitiveness. 

116
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,370
 The domestic game market pattern will not undergo fundamental changes in the next few years. 

117
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,910
 The top echelon has stood firm. 

118
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,840
 It is difficult for many new teams and new companies to enter the game. 

119
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,070
   

120
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,740
I want to meet Gao Jianhong.

121
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,190
Okay. Please wait.

122
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,340
Okay. Okay.

123
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,120
After two rounds of negotiations with Dark Blue,

124
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,990
we made the highest offer,

125
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,450
but they refused to sell.

126
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,910
Try again.

127
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,700
As to the price...

128
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,380
They can make any offer.

129
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,930
It can't be more expensive than making one ourselves.

130
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,800
Here we are.

131
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,740
Let me walk you in.

132
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,550
- I'll go alone. 
 - Okay.

133
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,220
Ren Di.

134
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,960
Ren Di.

135
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,320
Ren Di.

136
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,380
Ren Di.

137
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,610
Ren Di.

138
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,950
Don't shout so loudly!

139
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,480
The door was unlocked downstairs.

140
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,930
Can you be more cautious?

141
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,710
I can't remember how I came back yesterday.

142
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,740
Don't, dear. Don't pull it.

143
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,920
- What's wrong? 
 - Don't you remember I'm a vampire?

144
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,820
I can't see the light.

145
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,080
Get up and take a bath now. Hurry up.

146
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,460
My mom gave me 3 days to stay here.

147
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,270
You have one day.

148
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,610
I'll wait for you out there.

149
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,230
Okay.

150
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,560
 Of course. Some said that giants can monopolize popularity, 

151
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,190
 but not creativity. 

152
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,580
 I quite agree with that. 

153
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,510
 We never exclude competitions with new companies. 

154
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,810
 Of course, to some extent... 

155
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,790
Did you see the L&amp;P Building on your way here?

156
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,130
It's impressive.

157
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,610
Now L&amp;P is leading the domestic game market.

158
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,440
It monopolizes the industry.

159
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,990
But it has produced several games by copying foreign games.

160
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,130
It copies everything that others release.

161
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,790
And its games have higher sales.

162
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,660
You know nothing about these?

163
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,310
I paid no attention to it after going abroad.

164
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,800
Zhu Yun, L&amp;P means a lot to you.

165
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,060
Forget that man.

166
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,490
But can you forget the company?

167
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,040
It has nothing to do with me.

168
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,060
I want to drink.

169
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay.

170
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,860
Choose as you like.

171
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,870
When were you released?

172
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,470
Were you commuted?

173
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,750
What are your plans for the future?

174
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,080
Now that you're free, lead a good life.

175
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,270
Don't make mistakes again.

176
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,140
The company is doing well,

177
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,760
Mr. Gao.

178
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,090
State your business.

179
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,960
I have something to do later, so I won't talk nonsense with you.

180
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,940
You didn't come to me today to talk about the past, right?

181
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,610
Cut the euphemisms.

182
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,420
Tell me what you want.

183
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,080
If Li Xun hadn't been imprisoned,

184
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,910
L&amp;P wouldn't have been reduced to a copycat.

185
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,750
Reduced?

186
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,430
It's doing well, right?

187
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,310
I remember what you two said back then.

188
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,800
L&amp;P's vision was to increase the cure rate of cancer by one percent.

189
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,130
Listen.

190
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,040
What a great ideal!

191
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,860
However, if you're shameless enough,

192
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,240
you can earn both fame and wealth.

193
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,260
As soon as Li Xun is released, he'll get what he wants.

194
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,590
Perhaps as he said, that is who he is.

195
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,090
Perhaps he had no choices.

196
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,670
Think about it. As he was imprisoned, he could only leave the company to Gao Jianhong.

197
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,540
You three were best friends in college.

198
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,280
Besides you, he trusted Jianhong most. Right?

199
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,590
You'd better take this chance.

200
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,490
After all, we won't meet each other often.

201
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,950
I'll ask you one last time.

202
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,090
What do you want to do?

203
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,340
What you will do is your own business.

204
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,410
We've been friends for so many years.

205
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,660
I'll offer buyouts today

206
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,080
to ensure you a decent life.

207
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,200
Tell me how much you want.

208
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,220
I won't bargain.

209
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,840
Gao Jianhong,

210
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,010
listen.

211
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,080
Betrayers...

212
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,250
have to pay a price.

213
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,860
How are things now?

214
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,060
Okay. Let's dine first.

215
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,750
Actually, even if you don't tell me, I can guess it.

216
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
Don't blame him for this.

217
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,480
This happens all over the world.

218
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,750
You know what? When I was just released, even my parents turned a cold shoulder to me.

219
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,900
You're just his former classmate.

220
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,850
So-called friends are bullshit.

221
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,570
The closer he is to you, the more likely he is to betray you.

222
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,660
Why don't you come with me?

223
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,210
After all, we were in the same cell.

224
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,280
I've been waiting for you for a month since I was released.

225
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,640
I can help you with whatever you want.

226
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,320
I trust you, so I'm willing to work with you.

227
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,760
Now we're free.

228
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,980
With our skills,

229
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,010
we can make a fortune easily using computers and the internet.

230
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,700
That isn't what I want.

231
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,600
What do you want?

232
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,200
Come on. It's not worth perishing together with this guy.

233
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,900
Perishing together?

234
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
Is he worth it?

235
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,200
I don't understand.

236
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,300
Even if we go abroad, you can still get revenge. Right?

237
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,500
The point is, you were out of the industry for a long time.

238
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,700
How hard do you want to try to overthrow such a big company by proper means?

239
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,400
There is a simpler way.

240
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,700
Why don't you try?

241
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,100
Stop eating. Say something.

242
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,200
I don't need to avoid them.

243
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm not used to a simpler way.

244
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,900
I don't care whether it's hard or not.

245
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,100
What matters is to show them what they have to pay.

246
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
♫  Do you feel regret?  ♫

247
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,500
♫  Forget him  ♫

248
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:26,500
♫  Wipe away the tears and send him away  ♫

249
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:38,400
♫  Like two parallel lines we will not be concerned 
 about each other again  ♫

250
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,910
 Li Xun, I'm serious. 

251
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,500
♫  Turn into a one-person lonely island  ♫

252
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,400
 No matter what you want to do 

253
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,700
 and what your goal is in the future, 

254
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,300
 you can count me in. 

255
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I'm not joking. 

256
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
 I mean it. 

257
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,100
 I get it. 

258
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,380
What's wrong? Did you leave anything behind?

259
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,470
♫  How many stories are forgotten in this place  ♫

260
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,370
♫  Ruins created by time  ♫

261
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,700
Here.

262
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,200
When were you released?

263
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,800
Yesterday.

264
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm glad that you were released.

265
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,500
It seems that you did well.

266
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,900
I developed a management system for the jail.

267
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,600
You developed a system to imprison yourself.

268
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Great. Classic you!

269
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,400
Are you used to it now?

270
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
Does Zhu Yun know...

271
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,200
She just left. She may not know.

272
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Aren't you going to meet her?

273
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
No.

274
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Today, I came to see you for something else.

275
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
What is it?

276
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,500
Do you remember what we said at the bar?

277
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,300
 Thanks. 

278
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,700
 Thank you. We're Light Red. 

279
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
 Will you? 

280
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,000
 You'll be our boss if you invest in us. 

281
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,500
 You'll be a shareholder of our band. 

282
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,700
 You'll be paid at the agreed rate when the band has profits. 

283
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
You came for money?

284
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,500
You came to me for money?

285
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
Yes.

286
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Li Xun, your company with Gao Jianhong will go public soon.

287
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,500
You'll appear on the fortune list soon.

288
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
You even have the gall to ask me for a penny.

289
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,600
Everyone wants money.

290
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,600
Okay.

291
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,900
I'll give it to you.

292
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,500
I'll double it to make it a round figure.

293
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,100
Is that enough?

294
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,000
I didn't expect that money was the only connection between us.

295
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,700
Zhu Yun was actually right.

296
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
That's what you are.

297
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
But it's fine to hide it from her.

298
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,200
Don't disturb her happy life.

299
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,100
Do you remember Tian Xiuzhu?

300
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,200
He came back with Zhu Yun this time.

301
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
You don't believe it?

302
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,900
I think they came back to get married this time.

303
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
That's all?

304
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
I don't have cash here. Tell me the figure.

305
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,000
I'll ask someone to transfer it to you tomorrow.

306
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,800
See you.

307
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,900
    
 As a local excellent artist, Mr. Tian Xiuzhu

308
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,900
gave "Rocky," his most representative works, to our gallery.

309
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:03,300
It is the filling and enrichment of our library's collection system and also reflects to a greater extent our museum's

310
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,100
attention and deep participation in various types of Chinese contemporary art phenomena

311
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,300
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

312
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,000
You're young and promising.

313
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,600
Congratulations, Great Painter Tain.

314
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,600
I remember when I returned for the exhibition six years ago,

315
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,300
you were also attracted by this painting.

316
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:56,000
I was wondering what it meant as you looked at

317
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
my painting for a long time instead of giving a glance to "The Tempest" of Giorgione.

318
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,600
- What does it mean? 
 - You have no interest in art.

319
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
That's true.

320
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
 Rocky. 

321
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
 Rocky. 

322
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,700
 Come on. You like looking at it, right? 

323
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,900
 - Come on. Look at it. 
 - No. 

324
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,300
 Go on. 

325
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,500
 Go there. Go. Go on. Go on. 

326
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,700
 Get closer to it. Come on. 

327
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,600
Have you finished?

328
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,100
I can handle it abroad in the future, so I don't have to return.

329
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,000
Your phone kept ringing in your bag just now.

330
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,600
   

331
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,100
It's rare. You got up so early today.

332
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,700
Zhu Yun, after going abroad this time, will you come back later?

333
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,400
I shouldn't be back anytime soon.

334
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,800
Are you busy today?

335
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
No. What's wrong?

336
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,800
Bring your Great Painter Tian and do me a favor.

337
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,100
 I asked a design company to design an album cover for me. 

338
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,300
I'd like Mr. Tian to check it for me.

339
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,740
If there is no problem, pay them for me.

340
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,500
Something this important should be done by yourself.

341
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,380
As a star,

342
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,000
  I can't go out in person for this kind of publicity. 

343
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,300
 Don't talk nonsense. 

344
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,300
I'll write a check and have it sent express to you later.

345
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,900
Can't you transfer it to him directly?

346
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,500
 No. 

347
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,100
I need to ask Xiuzhu.

348
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,600
 I don't care. Anyway, you have to help me today. 

349
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,000
Then Great Painter Tian can you do me a favor?

350
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,400
Zhu Yun, dress nicely.

351
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,700
 Don't bring shame to our band. 

352
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,400
I got it.

353
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,500
♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

354
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,300
♫  And have passed through the dark night  ♫

355
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,200
♫  In the crowd in the dim light  ♫

356
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,090
♫  You're over there with the fireworks  ♫

357
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:46,600
 Li Xun, what kind of person do you think can be called a princess? 

358
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,300
 A princess... 

359
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

360
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,200
 A princess should... 

361
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,500
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

362
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,000
 ...have clear eyes. 

363
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,590
 Second, 

364
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,300
 she should be innocent and fragile. 

365
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,600
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

366
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,000
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

367
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,100
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

368
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,700
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

369
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,430
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

370
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,170
Thank you.

371
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,100
Now stars tend to pay with checks.

372
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,200
I asked her to transfer it, but she said there was a limit.

373
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
♫  That hot firework  ♫

374

♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

375
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,610
Give it a try.

376
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,100
How much does it cost to design an album cover now in China?

377
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,600
It seems to be a lot.

378
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
Maybe we should change careers and come back and do this.

379
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,000
I think it's a good idea.

380
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,900
I'll think about it.

381
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
This is for you.

382
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,000
How much? You want to have a look?

383
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,500
- Have a look. 
 - Have a look.

384
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,800
- Is it delicious? 
 - Yes.

385
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,400
Excuse me.

386
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800

396
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
You want to meet Li Xun?

397
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,400
Who are you? Where is he?

398
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,100
Are you his friend in the band?

399
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,700
Thank you. I came here for money.

400
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,700
This is for Li Xun?

401
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,300
Little boy, tell me.

402
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,700
What's your relation with Li Xun?

403
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,800
I'm not a little boy.

404
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,400
If you don't want to pay, just tell me.

405
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
I found those around Li Xun are hypocrites.

406
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,100
- Where is he? 
 - None of your business.

407
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,600
Li Xun.

408
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,340
Little boy?

409
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,360
   

410

412
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
Let go.

 He ranked first in our province's college entrance examination. 

423
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,300
 He is so... 

424
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,800
 Arrogant. 

425
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
 What's this? 

426
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,200
 Room 312 at the south gate. 

427
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
 He dated you directly. 

428
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,500
 That's indecent. 

429
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,800
 I'll never speak to him again.
