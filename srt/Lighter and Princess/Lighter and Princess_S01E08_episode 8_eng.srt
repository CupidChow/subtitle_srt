1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,659
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,339
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,379
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,219
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,099
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,059
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,779
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,699
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,819
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,139
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,979
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,579
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,979
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,209
Go back to work. It has been delayed for a day.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,160
Li Xun.

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,300
The base is yours.

25
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,820
Blue Crown's project is also yours.

26
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,310
You have the right to give it away.

27
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,150
I also have the right to quit.

28
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,190
Come and get the form.

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,709
- Help me pick it up. 
 - Are you a waste? You'll die if you pick it up?

30
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,620
She is really angry?

31
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,169
I think although Zhang Xiaobei has gone a bit far in this matter,

32
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,669
Li Xun's handling method is not wrong.

33
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,209
Zhang Xiaobei is backed by a large enterprise that cooperates with the school.

34
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,359
What can you do?

35
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,179
Give up Blue Crown's project?

36
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:15,700
Then why should we give up?

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,800
If you don't want to give up, just accept the reality.

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,000
You and Li Xun are really like birds of a feather.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,939
I'm much more realistic than him.

40
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,879
If I met Zhang Xiaobei, I would collude with her.

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,960
I would pretend to cooperate with her first.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,939
After I get what I want, I'll squeeze her out.

43
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,220
In this world, many people give in to money.

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,519
Even if it's a small sum of money, some will struggle for it.

45
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,169
Zhu Yun, you're just too well protected.

46
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,629
That guy is afraid of nothing.

47
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,189
He becomes a coward suddenly.

48
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,780
But he still puts on airs.

49
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,770
Why are you so angry?

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,710
You're not angry for this, right?

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,600
You feel sorry for Li Xun?

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,940
For him?

53
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,069
Since ancient times, infatuated women are always hurt by ruthless men.

54
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,450
Have you ever thought about why Li Xun agreed so simply?

55
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,069
He is afraid of offending Zhang Xiaobei. He's afraid.

56
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,440
Do you think Li Xun is that kind of person?

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,130
He is different from us.

58
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,860
He always knows his goal.

59
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,769
So he never mourns spring or feels sad for autumn.

60
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,859
He will give up things that are not worthwhile.

61
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:46,469
If he did something we didn't understand,

62
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,470
that must be because his way is more efficient and better.

63
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,960
Right?

64
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,180
- Hello. 
 - Hello. Senior, I'll be right there.

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
What's up? Whose call?

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,719
Han Jiakang.

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,509
Zhang Xiaobei is making a fuss and is asking everyone to get to the base.

68
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,070
You're free as you gave up directly.

69
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,160
What are you doing today?

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,629
I have no class. I want to sleep until I wake up naturally.

71
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,109
Are you okay?

72
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,759
You were high-spirited and energetic two days ago.

73
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,409
But you are so bored now? Can you make it?

74
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,989
I'm tired, okay?

75
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,499
I was so stressed out before. I can finally relax a little.

76
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,830
You really want to quit?

77
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,680
Or else?

78
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,079
The base list workload yesterday.

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,839
You're still on the list.

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,800
You have full attendance reported by Group Leader Li.

81
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,200
Really?

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,130
You'll mess it up.

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,420
Why are you so slow?

84
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,580
Thank you so much for all your hard work and dedication.

85
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,910
The project is progressing well.

86
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,760
But whether a project can go on smoothly in the end,

87
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,300
in addition to ability, a lot of other things are required.

88
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,859
In this case, Xichuang will provide us with technical support.

89
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:55,829
Supported by a large platform, I think, everyone can learn more from it.

90
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,159
I know Li Xun was in charge of this project before.

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,309
Li Xun is excellent, but he is young after all.

92
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,880
He has insufficient experience.

93
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,090
I am not modest at this point.

94
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,909
From nothing to taking the position of the head of the project department,

95
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,320
I've also handled hundreds of projects.

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,760
So next I'll be mainly responsible for Blue Crown's project.

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Han Jiakang will serve as the team leader.

98
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,740
Then please give your class schedules to Team Leader Han.

99
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,050
We assign tasks according to your schedules.

100
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,170
Stay at the base when you have no class to attend.

101
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,860
Any question?

102
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,700
Here is a tip.

103
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,230
Attendance is not a bluff.

104
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:49,079
Your attendance will eventually be reflected in your remuneration and the project's signature rights.

105
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,360
I hope everyone can be more conscientious and responsible for the project.

106
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,750
You can't always take yourself as a college student.

107
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,740
Learn to be responsible for yourself.

108
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,989
   

109
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,230
Who is in charge of art design?

110
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,150
Zhu Yun was in charge of that UI part before.

111
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,760
The class rep.

112
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,110
Where is she?

113
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,410
She has classes today.

114
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,359
You two are in the same class.

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,760
She has classes alone?

116
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,809
It's an elective course.

117
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,640
Mr. He Pei's "Introduction to 'The Book of Changes'."

118
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,190
Didn't Mr. He Pei go abroad to study?

119
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,770
That course was taught by another teacher.

120
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,790
Another teacher?

121
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,610
Who is it?

122
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,989
I forgot the name.

123
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:08,710
Then turn on the Academic Affairs Online and show it to me.

124
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,510
I can do nothing about it, either.

125
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,960
Let me connect to the internet.

126
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,370
   

127
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,240
   

128
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,940
Okay, turn it off.

129
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,590
Change this one.

130
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,710
    
 "Introduction to 'the Book of Changes'."

131
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,859
Fang Shumiao, what's wrong with my schedule?

132
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:56,369
Piggy. Piggy. I'm so jealous of you.

133
00:10:56,369 --> 00:10:57,679
What happened to me?

134
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,850
But Li Xun was really brave.

135
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,310
I think Li Xun treats you differently.

136
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,549
I don't think so. He must be afraid of trouble.

137
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:10,849
He's afraid Zhang Xiaobei will find something to torture you again,

138
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,720
thus delaying the project progress.

139
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,179
He shouldn't have hacked the website.

140
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,380
Li Xun is writing an inspection in the department now.

141
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,899
Miss, understand it yourself.

142
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,930
I won't say anything more.

143
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,729
Or I will feel more jealous.

144
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,600
Fang Shumiao.

145
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,589
You know what?

146
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,309
We are now being tortured by Zhang Xiaobei.

147
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,659
But the poorest one is Li Xun.

148
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,399
The project he has worked hard on has been occupied by others.

149
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,799
Now, Zhang Xiaobei is the project leader and Han Jiakang is the team leader.

150
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,470
And Li Xun has no trace left.

151
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,179
Zhang Xiaobei even robs theposition of the project leader?

152
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,299
Yeah.

153
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:55,379
When the project is signed finally, what position will Li Xun be given in the end?

154
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,279
Let me figure it out.

155
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,830
How many people have come from the Graduate School?

156
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,669
Who does Zhang Xiaobei think she is?

157
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,359
She came here to show off her authority.

158
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,880
Yeah. Why should we just listen to her?

159
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,479
Isn't Li Xun very resourceful?

160
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,489
Yeah.

161
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:24,080
Why didn't he respond?

162
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,590
I think Li Xun will have a way.

163
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:38,490
You mean just like the last bidding, he will leave a way out?

164
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,759
The brain circuit of a genius is different from ours.

165
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,019
This kind of enduring hardships and humiliation

166
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,280
and then defeating the enemy sounds very exciting.

167
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,960
I'll have a drumstick.

168
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,659
What's up, senior?

169
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,989
Can you send me a copy of the written project description for bidding?

170
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,589
Senior, you are now the team leader.

171
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,880
It's not difficult to write a project description, right?

172
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,410
Didn't you also participate in the bidding?

173
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,780
Does Zhang Xiaobei want it?

174
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,689
I won't send it unless you tell me.

175
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,490
It's Zhang Xiaobei.

176
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,340
She's going to give an interview about...

177
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,080
about our project.

178
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,700
Does Li Xun know it?

179
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,359
Why?

180
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,189
She doesn't even know what the project is.

181
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,429
She doesn't know the BIOS.

182
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,120
Why does all the credit go to her?

183
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,590
This project is Li Xun's.

184
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,900
Who knows who Li Xun is?

185
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,419
What do you mean?

186
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,519
Zhang Xiaobei is backed by Xinchuang.

187
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,640
She is young, but she can be a project director of one of the top 500 enterprises.

188
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,760
She's worth an interview.

189
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,090
What about Li Xun?

190
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,859
He's just a college student.

191
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,329
Or the kind that no one knows after leaving school.

192
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,909
Who cares how great he is?

193
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,299
Who cares who he is?

194
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,569
Who cares how much he paid for this project and how many nights he spent on this project?

195
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,930
Who cares if this project is robbed by others?

196
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,639
You didn't participate in the bidding of Blue Crown from start to finish, right?

197
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,860
As for Li Xun's matter, I care.

198
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,270
You are back?

199
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,930
You have a week left for the green part.

200
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,450
   

201
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,519
This part hasn't been started yet?

202
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,760
This is your task.

203
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,080
What if I didn't come back?

204
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,920
You were so sure I'd be back?

205
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,690
Did you dare?

206
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,610
Say what you want.

207
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,900
Li Xun, you'll find a way out. Right?

208
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,419
Zhang Xiaobei bullied you like that.

209
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,899
You wouldn't be unresponsive.

210
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,569
You must be up to something like in the last bidding.

211
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:33,040
Are you ready to fight back?

212
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,119
What do you mean?

213
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,090
Just tell me what you're thinking about.

214
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,300
Finish the Blue Crown's project as soon as possible to get rid of trouble.

215
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,040
Is it a good idea?

216
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,710
Zhu Yun, do you know?

217
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,000
At the very beginning,

218
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,280
everything is the way it is.

219
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,310
The more you move towards it, the more it deviates.

220
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,130
But it is still worth our efforts.

221
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,710
We work hard just to keep it from going further.

222
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,040
Am I right?

223
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,480
You're right about everything.

224
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,150
You can complain.

225
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,220
Don't think about a solution.

226
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,020
If you want to quit, never come back again.

227
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,869
The formalities have been completed?

228
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,870
I've given them to the teaching secretary.

229
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,629
I'm free finally.

230
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,919
Base, Blue Crown's project, Zhang Xiaobei, goodbye.

231
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,069
From today on, I'm finally free.

232
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,549
You're in such a hurry?

233
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,279
People should have self-knowledge.

234
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,579
Since the first professional class, I knew I couldn't rely on computers to earn a living.

235
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:49,419
So to say, I work in the base because I want to earn credit

236
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,179
and leave a good impression on the department.

237
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,529
Then you've got your wish.

238
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,239
Li Xun gave you the highest score.

239
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,740
So I actively leave fast to stop holding you back.

240
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,530
   

241
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,810
It's not right again.

242
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,049
    
 I've changed the navigation bar's color five times.

243
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,899
    
 Damned Zhang Xiaobei!

244
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:06,339
Actually, Zhang Xiaobei knows nothing.

245
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,250
You can still muddle through.

246
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,910
She may be too picky about the website's appearance.

247
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,150
Zhu Yun, come here.

248
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,480
She has no public morality.

249
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,919
I thought about it again.

250
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,579
I don't think our fonts look good now.

251
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,549
I would like the one that is popular this year.

252
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,670
The one in metallic quicksand gold.

253
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,519
But our background is white.

254
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,769
The gold and white are too close to be seen clearly.

255
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:37,440
Then change the background.

256
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,789
It's not that simple.

257
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,339
At the early stage, we've made many plug-ins.

258
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,009
To change the background, we need to overwrite the previous plug-ins.

259
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:44,910
Change them.

260
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,689
But it will affect the whole project.

261
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,609
If the previous plug-ins need to be changed, a lot of data will be wrong.

262
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:51,969
Everyone has to follow suit.

263
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,550
These should be what you think about.

264
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,619
Keep improving when doing things.

265
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,969
If you just make ordinarythings from the beginning,

266
00:19:58,969 --> 00:20:01,840
in the end, a slight mistake may cause a big failure.

267
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,180
That's it.

268
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,009
Please draw a picture for me tonight. I would like to have a look first.

269
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:07,009
Today?

270
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,400
Is it difficult to draw a picture?

271
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,940
Okay.

272
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,670
I'm so angry.

273
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,139
Calm down. Remember her license plate number.

274
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:18,850
Stab her tire.

275
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,460
It makes sense.

276
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,610
   

277
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,290
Stick it for me.

278
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,060
Hello, Miss Zhang.

279
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,300
 Zhu Yun, as for the navigation bar... 

280
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,069
This is a good idea.

281
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,349
So annoying.

282
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,510
Within only a few days, I've already drawn five drafts of the design.

283
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,919
I change the font and navigation bar color again and again.

284
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,579
She is so annoying.

285
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,219
Li Xun, why don't you assign me to other projects?

286
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:01,660
As long as you can save me, I can do anything.

287
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,519
There are no other projects.

288
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,360
Stay honestly.

289
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,939
 Zhu Yun? 

290
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:11,640
 Are you listening, Zhu Yun? 

291
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,340
I am here. What else is wrong?

292
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,009
Just tell me and I will change it.

293
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,290
 Well, I think the first draft is better. 

294
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,549
 What's your opinion? 

295
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,069
Just say it's good when I design the first draft!

296
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,689
Now it's the fifth draft. You say the first draft is good!

297
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,590
Why did you ask me to change it again and again?

298
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,479
Turn off the mute mode and curse her if you have the guts.

299
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,649
 Zhu Yun, please finish the design drawing today. 

300
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:32,549
Didn't you say to use the first edition?

301
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,659
 The first version's basic framework can be used. 

302
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,990
 But I want the fonts of the second edition. 

303
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,279
 I think the border of the fourth edition is the best. 

304
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,109
 Well, just mix them together. 

305
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,289
 This shouldn't be difficult, right? 

306
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:46,139
It isn't hard? Do it yourself, if so!

307
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,560
Miss Zhang, Blue Crown called me today.

308
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,790
 Why didn't they call me? 

309
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,670
They intend to come to learn the progress on Monday.

310
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,339
 Zhu Yun, how long will it take to change it? 

311
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,430
At least three days.

312
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,080
 Then, let's do it like this. 

313
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,120
Then I will follow the current one?

314
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,560
 Okay. 

315
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,940
Thanks.

316
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,180
Don't forget to help me.

317
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,730
You are so realistic.

318
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,570
Mr. Chen,

319
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,949
compared with those payment designs and product list designs,

320
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,869
actually our biggest innovation is this one.

321
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,210
You can have a try.

322
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,100
 (Blue Crown Website) 

323
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,489
How is it? Is it interesting?

324
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:50,639
This is called micro interaction or micro-motion effect.

325
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,589
It is hot now on foreign websites.

326
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,719
 My God. 

327
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,719
 She has talked about the micro interaction for so long. 

328
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,149
 She really only knows whether the website looks good or not. 

329
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,209
Even the small mouse, pop-up box, and product drawings

330
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:04,629
are very interesting.

331
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,670
It's simple and easy to use.

332
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,570
I promise every user who enters will like it.

333
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,199
And recently I did some market research.

334
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,069
Our website now is the first large-scale one with the use of this design.

335
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,909
As for some follow-up issues in system updating and maintenance,

336
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:25,180
you can ask your men to contact Han Jiakang directly.

337
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,250
We will be responsible to the end.

338
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,740
Okay. I think it's good.

339
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,199
I have something else to talk about with Mr. Chen.

340
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,519
You go back first.

341
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,310
All right, Miss Zhang.

342
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,040
We can leave now.

343
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,309
Do you have any additional suggestions?

344
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,810
None for the time being.

345
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,750
It's all her credit again.

346
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,199
The project has been completed.

347
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
It's my treat tonight.

348
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,310
Let's go. It's Team Leader Li's treat.

349
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,910
   

350
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,820
What's wrong?

351
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,600
What's wrong?

352
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,820
Senior, are you all right?

353
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,089
Tomorrow, I have to help Zhang Xiaobei move her house tomorrow.

354
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,870
I have new projects.

355
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,180
We can't finish my topic.

356
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,890
She won't let me graduate if I can't finish it.

357
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,290
I see.

358
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,770
I have been a graduate student for three years.

359
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,790
My senior has studied for four years.

360
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,710
Since the first year of graduate school,

361
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,730
we have been working on projects for Zhang Xiaobei.

362
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,249
My senior can't finish his paper at all because Zhang Xiaobei doesn't give him the data.

363
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:29,670
She prevents him deliberately from graduating.

364
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,429
My senior has worked for her for a whole year and earns only 800 yuan.

365
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,830
It was because he asked her for payment.

366
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,689
Well, if you don't want to do it, don't do it.

367
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,140
It's not that easy.

368
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,360
She's from Xinchuang and has a good relationship with the school.

369
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,280
We students don't dare to offend her.

370
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,480
To tell you the truth.

371
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,489
She robbed the Blue Crown project.

372
00:26:10,489 --> 00:26:14,530
We had nothing at all on the day of the public explanation.

373
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,160
It wasn't until that day that we learned about the project.

374
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,369
Even with my eyes closed, I know what she will say to the person in charge of Blue Crown after we left.

375
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:24,710
I can dare to vouch with my head on the line,

376
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,730
none of your names will appear.

377
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,620
In this project,

378
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,110
whether from inside or outside,

379
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,670
it's all her own credit.

380
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,850
I'm sorry that I held you back.

381
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,480
Every day, I even helped her get data and results from you.

382
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,110
I have no face to meet you.

383
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,220

♫  Who controls the marionette? ♫

401
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,300
 At the very beginning, everything is the way it is. 

402
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,939
The more you move towards it, the more it deviates.

403
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:28,769
 But it is still worth our efforts. 

404
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,000
 We work hard just to keep it from going further. 

405
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,339
It's-It's really okay?

406
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:45,549
It is okay. Leave us alone.

407
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:47,419
- Don't worry. 
 - Sounds good.

408
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,190
Amazing.

409
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,560
 Be careful. 

410
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,420
Brother Wang, well, can I borrow your car?

411
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,170
My car?

412
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,159
Because I won't allow you to sing here, you're not going to do something shady with my car, are you?

413
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,379
Not at all.

414
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:11,309
I'll send the goods away,

415
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,859
then I'll send the car back to you later.

416
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:13,719
Goods?

417
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,190
What goods?

418
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,669
Ren Di, you sing well.

419
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,340
You're going to strangle me.

420
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,939
Why are you drunk like this?

421
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,519
You ordered Long Island Iced Tea.

422
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,620
I just ordered one glass.

423
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,760
She had five glasses.

424
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,449
Let's go back to the dorm.

425
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,050
But it's 2:00 a.m. now.

426
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,149
Or go to my place.

427
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:49,239
You lead the way.

428
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Okay, I'll push it.

429
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,069
I pull the cart, you hold her.

430
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,840
Okay.

431
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,540
Li Xun, what are you doing?

432
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,610
Pulling the cart.

433
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,000
Are you a cow? Why do you pull a cart?

434
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,530
Shut up.

435
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,180
What a strong wind. What a strong wind!

436
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,769
Are you sober?

437
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,810

490
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,829
Yeah. Usually, he stays at the base.

491
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,239
Sometimes he comes here if it's late.

492
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,279
He-He's still sleeping at the base?

493
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,150
No, he sleeps here.

494
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,339
I forgot to tell you. He's my investor.

495
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,760
You were curious about our relationship, right?

496
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,999
That's what it means.

497
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,600
He's the investor I brought in.

498
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,699
You know what?

499
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,229
In my place, Li Xun has a suite.

500
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,049
I have only one bed here.

501
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:21,950
So later, if you need to go to the bathroom, go out...

502
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,380
Go out of this door and turn right to the end.

503
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,940
Okay?

504
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,630
Then I'm going to bed.

505
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,420
Here. Here's your water.

506
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,070
Get some sleep.

507
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,600
So heavy.

508
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,690
Put your legs down.

509
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,970
   

510
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,370
Get up.

511
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,480
Let go. Let go.

512
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,190
This way, this way.

513
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,030
Wipe yourself with it and throw it away.

514
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,090
This is not Ren Di's room?

515
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,430
Get out.

516
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,720
What are you doing?

517
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,869
- Can I help you? 
 - No.

518
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:06,780
Let me have a look.

519
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,190
It's none of your business.

520
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,870
Go to sleep.

521
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,309
Okay. I'll shut up. I'm leaving.

522
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,220
It's weird.

523
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,020
The project is completed.

524
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,800
What is he writing?

525
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,899
Blue. Blue Crown.

526
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:35,199
What project are you working on?

527
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,819
- You want to hide it from us? Tell us. 
 - Lower your voice.

528
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:37,600
-  Tell me. 
 - Shut up.

529
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,340
- What are you doing? 
 - Shut up.

530
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,780
Blue Crown, right?

531
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,650
Shut up. Shut up!

532
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,890
Shut up!

533
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,170
Tell me! Tell me!

534
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,229
Shut up. Shut up!

535
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,150
Shut up. You shut up first.

536
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,650
Why do you look like a maniac after drinking a little wine?

537
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,639
Don't change the subject. What is it?

538
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,640
Why do you talk all day long?

539
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,170
You are inquiring from morning till night.

540
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,430
What on earth is it?

541
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,610
Are you sober now?

542
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,529
I'm so sober that I can immediately make a set of college entrance examination paper.

543
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,140
Okay. Check it yourself.

544
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,279
- The main functions of this system... 
 - Keep quite.

545
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:39,170
I can watch it myself.

546
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,650
I can understand your codes now.

547
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,720
I won't be confused by them.

548
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,559
Just tell me. What are you doing this for?

549
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,430
For sale.

550
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,440
For sale?

551
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,220
Blue Crown's website is out of date.

552
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,610
We can't make money from it.

553
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,740
Why didn't you tell them if that was so?

554
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,540
If I told them, what would I earn?

555
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,250
There are so many shopping websites

556
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,470
and many large platforms now.

557
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,069
Blue Crown produces and sell products by itself.

558
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,600
Their website has no characteristics.

559
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,840
Why would customers access their website and buy goods?

560
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,469
They don't even know their advantages but just follows the trend.

561
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,720
Is money so easy to earn?

562
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,750
What are you writing now?

563
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,910
Mobile Health App.

564
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,770
With the rise of smart phones, applications are the trend.

565
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,840
So you lied to us?

566
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,600
Didn't you always say I had two strings to my bow?

567
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,950
But you guessed it right.

568
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,120
There are only a few good projects.

569
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,610
If you don't fight for them, they'll be taken over by others.

570
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,810
She wanted me to give in to her?

571
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,500
Impossible.

572
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,440
What we did before was futile?

573
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,499
Then you could have told us. We could have made this app together.

574
00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:12,960
There are many ways to solve things.

575
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,040
Now that I can do better,

576
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,150
and you can also use that project to sort out the process and increase experience,

577
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,380
there is no need to waste time.

578
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,890
When Zhang Xiaobei finds out that she has been fooled by me,

579
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,470
she will never let me go easily.

580
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,580
Don't you care about our lives?

581
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,320
Of course I'm not worried.

582
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,500
But you're too annoying.

583
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,540
And you're meddlesome and have wishful thinking,

584
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,550
which affects me.

585
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,520
When did I affect you?

586
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,240
Zhu Yun,

587
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,100
I'll explain this only once.

588
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,330
If you get angry again, I...

589
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,550
I don't lie to people.

590
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000


591
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,310
   

592
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,490
 Li Xun. 

593
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,839
 You played a dirty move? 

594
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,080
 You were expelled from Linyang No. 8 Middle School. 

595
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,620
 There are punishments on your disciplinary record. 

596
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,260
 If you apologize to me now, there is still time. 

597
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,160
 There is no point in fighting against me. 

598
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,630
 I don't understand what you mean. 

599
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,980
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

600
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,700
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫
