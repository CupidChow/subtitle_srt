2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,900
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,460
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,680
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,030
   

21
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,620
   

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,300
In short, we want to make a better and more playable game based on the source code of "Blind Box of Love,"

23
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,790
but the premise is to avoid all possible legal risks to enable our company to go public.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,740
The code of "Blind Box of Love" is very complicated.

25
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,860
If we change the most critical part, the specific function will be affected.

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,700
We spent a week proposing an alternative solution,

27
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,460
but we failed.

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,760
You can't give up.

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,100
Even if the game will lack some functions,

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,800
we can't give Flying Company any chance to sue us.

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,960
Do you have any other solution?

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,860
Don't change the code.

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,420
This is a trap.

34
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,110
Li Xun wrote such a complicated code because he wanted us to give up changing it.

35
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,380
Even if we change the code, the situation is still under his control.

36
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,710
Mr. Gao, then our "Perfect Girlfriend"...

37
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,370
Copy the code.

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,540
The only way of launching the "Perfect Girlfriend" in the shortest time

39
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,510
is to directly copy the source code of "Blind Box of Love".

40
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,000
I disagree.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,260
I disagree.

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,990
You go out.

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,630
Gao Jianhong,

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
are you crazy?

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,100
I was tolerant of you stealing and hacking codes before.

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,260
I know you're angry.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,170
We used to imitate the styles and core playing methods,

48
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,950
but you can't directly copy his source code.

49
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,340
Calm down.

50
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,100
There are many more open game source codes online.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,280
More?

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,270
Tell me where the excess is.

53
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,760
Do you think it's the "Gluttonous Snake" or "Link Game"?

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,900
Actually, Li Xun wrote the code independently.

55
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,020
We can't find any similar one at all.

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,140
Gao Jianhong, after our company goes public, you can suit yourself,

57
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,110
but it's a sensitive period, we'll be imprisoned if you do so.

58
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,890
Now that I have decided to copy his source code, I've thought about how to deal with the lawsuit.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,590
I'm not worried about this.

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,900
Infringement litigation costs are high, compensation is low and proof is difficult.

61
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,050
A small company can't beat us.

62
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,400
Believe me. Within a week, he'll drop the case.

63
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,600
Do you believe it?

64
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,760
How will you fight against them?

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,200
You should know that Li Xun's capital source is not just Flying Company.

66
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,520
Now many investors want to invest in his game, and he has a brother and Light Red Band.

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,220
They all can provide him with strong financial support.

68
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,950
They can help him at a crucial time.

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:09,650
It reminds me of Ren Di, the woman of Light Red Band.

70
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,410
Wasn't she your classmate?

71
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,000
Why does she help him but not you?

72
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,000
Gao Jianhong,

73
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,480
I've never seen Li Xun giving up anything.

74
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,850
As for you,

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,550
I'm looking forward to the day you can defeat him.

76
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,040
Then you have to take good care of yourself.

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,100
So anxious to launch the "Perfect Girlfriend,"  and rush to hell?

78
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,970
Fang Zhijing! Who do you think you are?

79
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,510
How dare you criticize me!

80
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,640
Only when I treat you as a partner can you be my partner,

81
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,110
or else you're just an employee.

82
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,710
You're nothing.

83
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,040
Okay. Okay.

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,170
Remember your words.

85
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,080
Okay.

86
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,840
I don't want to be imprisoned.

87
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,670
I'll redeem my shares today.

88
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,560
I won't play with you anymore.

89
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,810
Don't worry.

90
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,320
I'll help with your resignation procedures, Mr. Fang.

91
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,370
Gao Jianhong,

92
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,750
take a good look at the computer screen, you're acting like a dead man.

93
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,980
Do you know that the company would have collapsed without me?

94
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,040
These years, I solicited business, investment and resources for this company!

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,560
Do you really think the company's development depends on you?

96
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,840
Well, just see how many employees will stay

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,960
and whether the company will collapse after I quit.

98
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,420
Go public?

99
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,270
No way.

100
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,950
Fang Zhijing, listen up.

101
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,830
What I care about has never been whether the company can go public.

102
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,330
What time is it?

103
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,600
It's 4:00 a.m.

104
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,610
Let me do it. You go to get some rest.

105
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,700
No need.

106
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,960
From they getting the source code to changing the art resources and technical functions,

107
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,340
we haven't had much time for preparations.

108
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,450
Are you sure?

109
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,170
Once Gao Jianhong copies the "Blind Box of Love,"

110
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,320
given the level of L &amp; P's platform, he'll launch another similar game.

111
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,950
By then Flying will definitely not be able to fight back,

112
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,270
and we will lose our only current source of income.

113
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,630
This is betting.

114
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Do you still believe me?

115
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,210
But, Li Xun, you can't do technical updates

116
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,260
and prepare such a complicated intellectual property lawsuit at the same time.

117
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,550
Fang Shumiao can help us with it.

118
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,570
You don't need to do so much work alone.

119
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,900
You've stayed up late for a week.

120
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,460
After this war comes to an end, I'll have enough time to rest.

121
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,750
   

122
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,390
   

123
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,750
 Look. It looks good. 

124
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,970
 Yeah. 

125
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
 She looks like the idol you're chasing. 

126
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,300
This is the hottest girls' group.

127
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,850
Gao Jianhong is really generous.

128
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,890
L &amp; P always spends a lot of money on publicity.

129
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,860
60% of their investment is spent on publicity.

130
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,370
He has vigorously advertised it at the beginning of the internal test.

131
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,140
I've finished its decomposition.

132
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,720
The left code belongs to the "Perfect Girlfriend," and the right one is the "Love Blind Box."

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,040
They're the same.

134
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,930
They were not changed at all.

135
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,840
Congratulations. Your Trojan Horse has successfully entered L &amp; P.

136
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,490
It's impossible. Gao Jianhong provides us with evidence on his own?

137
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,590
It's not important. As long as he copies our source code, we can sue him.

138
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,920
I agree.

139
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,470
Maybe he is eager to make an achievement to make L &amp; P go public,

140
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,970
so he copied the source code.

141
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,810
Anyway, he may think he can force you to drop the case.

142
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,240
Li Xun.

143
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,020
Get ready to sue him.

144
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,570
I've prepared all the materials.

145
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,430
Ask Hou Ning if you have any questions.

146
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,900
- When should we sue him? 
 - It's not urgent.

147
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,840
Wait until their game goes online and makes a big profit.

148
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,190
These days, you contact other companies.

149
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,420
Contact all the companies that had trouble with L &amp; P in copyright.

150
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,810
If they want us to sue L&amp;P on their behalf, it's better.

151
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,040
We can bear all the expenses.

152
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,420
If they don't want, it doesn't matter.

153
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,930
Gather as much evidence as possible.

154
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,120
Don't think too much.

155
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
Counter every move.

156
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,350
The codes are indeed the same.

157
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,750
- Li Xun. 
 - Li Xun.

158
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,610
- Li Xun. 
 - What's wrong with Li Xun?

159
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,890
Li Xun.

160
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,430
You'll get better.

161
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,450
   

162
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,130
You can't go in.

163
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,530
Li Xun, let me go.

164
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,600
You'll be out soon.

165
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,740
It's all right. It's just a CT scan, it's not life or death.

166
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,490
Be good. Let me go.

167
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,690
What's wrong with him?

168
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,160
I'm all right.

169
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,130
   

170
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,100
He has been here before, right?

171
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,590
Yes. But he came for his lumbar vertebra a few years ago.

172
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,050
What does he do?

173
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,270
IT, the computer industry.

174
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,260
I see.

175
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,150
Don't worry. His disease is not serious.

176
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,340
But it's still a problem with the spine.

177
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,090
Osteoarthritis of the spine is caused by the lumbar vertebra.

178
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,450
The symptoms are quite obvious.

179
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,190
Well, it is really a high-risk industry

180
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,710
with several sudden deaths every year.

181
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,850
But how could you faint from a spinal problem?

182
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,270
His back was stiff. The blood could only flow to his shoulders,

183
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,040
but his brain has been working at a high intensity for a long time, requiring large amounts of oxygen and blood gas.

184
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,860
It's no wonder he doesn't get dizzy after such a conflict.

185
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,150
What should he do?

186
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,200
Rest and exercise.

187
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,770
Brother Xiuzhu.

188
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,990
Zhu Yun.

189
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,610
How is he?

190
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,490
He is all right.

191
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,230
I didn't know he was in the hospital until Guo Shijie told me.

192
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,630
You haven't contacted me these days.

193
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,270
What you said was right.

194
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,450
He is indeed in poor health, but he just endured it.

195
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,670
No one has endless energy.

196
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,210
It's lucky for a man to live a safe and healthy life.

197
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,420
This seems to be the first time you have kept my words in mind.

198
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,340
Are you sure?

199
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,030
You won't leave?

200
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,740
I won't.

201
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:44,270
I've never seen a girl who can drive herself into a corner and never regret it.

202
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,340
Zhu Yun,

203
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,740
I came here this time just to say goodbye to you in person.

204
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,410
I've decided to give up.

205
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,990
After hearing it, don't you feel more relaxed?

206
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,200
There are so many infatuated women in this world,

207
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,900
but they can combine fate, work and life with their ideals.

208
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,600
There are too few women who can hold them all together.

209
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,920
You can't bear it all.

210
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,530
You are merely trying to.

211
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,080
Okay, I will remind you one last thing.

212
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,600
You and Li Xun already have a lot of regrets.

213
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,450
Stop wasting your time so recklessly.

214
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,050
Ask your heart and summon your courage to face them.

215
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,800
You're thinner.

216
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,010
Fighting for love is good,

217
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,670
but it's not romantic to faint at work.

218
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,310
I know.

219
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,250
I'm leaving.

220
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,090
Who is it?

221
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,190
Morning. Where's Li Xun?

222
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,760
He is inside.

223
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,340
How do you feel today?

224
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,070
I'm better.

225
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,340
I brought you some congee. Heat and eat it later.

226
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,440
What's wrong?

227
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,360
What?

228
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,060
Give it to me.

229
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,700
What's wrong?

230
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,010
- Anything else? 
 - Nothing more.

231
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,430
- Give it to me. 
 - There is really nothing.

232
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,940
Give it to me.

233
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,000
- How do you know everything? 
 - Hurry up.

234
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,020
They're confiscated.

235
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,500
Rest and recuperate. I'll keep them for you.

236
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,430
You're annoying.

237
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,500
- Who is annoying? 
 - You.

238
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,060
What's wrong?

239
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,120
My arm aches.

240
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,090
Here?

241
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,460
♫  I forgot time unconsciously  ♫

242
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,340
- Ouch. 
 - Ouch.

243
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,870
- It aches or itches? 
 - Aches.

244
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,490
No wonder it aches in this posture.

245
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,780
Do you want to go back to the hospital?

246
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,240
I've asked Dong Siyang for leave.

247
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,390
You can't go to work this week but can only rest and recuperate.

248
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,650
You can really make up your own mind.

249
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,040
Princess, you are quite courageous now.

250
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,100
I can get more courageous.

251
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,930
Really?

252
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,680
Just wait and see.

253
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,900
I want to see now.

254
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,510
You can get even with me after getting better.

255
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,260
Okay.

256
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,040
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

257
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,290
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

258
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,050
♫  By my side or on my pillow, you say every good night  ♫

259
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,350
♫  Happiness has never changed  ♫

260
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,030
Hey, guys. Let's have a meeting, have a meeting.

261
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,680
Here.

262
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,820
Our Flying is now in a special period.

263
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,230
We'll directly fight against L &amp; P soon.

264
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,980
You have to make full preparations.

265
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,590
I have only one request out of all of you.

266
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,510
Just do it.

267
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,820
Hou Ning, tell them the follow-up work about the "Blind Box of Love".

268
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,070
The next update is mainly to optimize the process.

269
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,650
I've added two-factor authentication,

270
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,560
and the function of brushing instance zones with friends, namely the multiplayer mode.

271
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,930
Players can also form teams in this game?

272
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,320
Political Commissar Zhu, aren't you not participating in all the activities of our "Blind Box of Love"?

273
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,340
Am I the one who wants to participate? With you guys having a meeting around me, how can I not hear?

274
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,390
Okay, stand up. Stand up. Move your limbs.

275
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,420
Listen to the political commissar. Come on.

276
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,410
Let's do eye exercises next time.

277
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,370
You can. Think of Li Xun.

278
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,820
- March. 
  - 1, 2, 3, 4. 

279
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,210
 5, 6, 7, 8. 

280
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,650
 2, 2, 3, 4. 

281
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,240
 5, 6, 7. Stop. 

282
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,800
 Body turning motion. 

283
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,870
 Ready, go. 

284
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,210
 1, 2, 3, 4. 

285
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,540
What are you doing?

286
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,130
Check if it has any problems.

287
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,680
I've confirmed it with Li Xun.

288
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,380
It can be submitted to the court anytime.

289
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,410
What did he say?

290
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,840
Nothing special. He said it's the right time.

291
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,340
The turnover of Gao Jianhong's "Perfect Girlfriend" has reached a peak now,

292
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,440
just in time for the review period by the CSRC for the listing of L &amp; P.

293
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,500
If we act at this time, we will really catch the sheep when they are the fattest.

294
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,700
He's really ruthless.

295
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,780
L &amp; P should pay back what it owes.

296
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,410
There are too many companies that have copyright disputes with them.

297
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,800
Those small companies in the past either swallowed their anger or couldn't make a splash.

298
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,500
But we have concrete and enough evidence this time

299
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,810
so the top scorer Li is going to eliminate harm for the people.

300
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,010
When will it be submitted?

301
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,030
There are only 10-odd days left before the holiday,

302
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,230
and the lawyer of L &amp; P must have booked a ticket for the holiday.

303
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,080
You're really vicious.

304
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,490
Thank you.

305
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,370
I'm off duty.

306
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,910
Wait for me. I'll be back soon.

307
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,250
- Come in. 
 - Lawyer Wang, this is a court summons.

308
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,370
- Put it here. 
 - Won't you check it?

309
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,010
No, I won't.

310
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,490
Our company has received too many letters from lawyers.

311
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,590
I'll check it after coming back from holiday.

312
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,030
Shanshan, which company is going to sue our company this time?

313
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,030
Let me see.

314
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,030
It's a class action.

315
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,450
My Heart Flying Network is the main suitor,

316
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,910
and 10-odd companies are also involved in it.

317
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,690
Well, let me see.

318
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,420
   

319
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,180
   

320
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,900
Return my plane ticket. Call the others back.

321
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay.

322
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,400
The lawsuit itself is not difficult to fight,

323
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
but our company is now at the critical moment of going public.

324
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,900
Others will be prone to make an issue of this class action,

325
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,400
and the shareholders will also distrust our company.

326
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,900
Forget it.

327
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,400
But we're in a passive position. Once it becomes serious...

328
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,000
Why does everyone want me to say it over and over?

329
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,300
Since I dared do this, I have my own way to deal with him.

330
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,100
Do you understand?

331
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
Okay.

332
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,000
Why are you here?

333
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,700
Gao Jianhong is not here. He doesn't live here now.

334
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm here to see you.

335
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Old Gao is ill.

336
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,300
Ill?

337
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,800
Brain glioma.

338
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,100
It's malignant.

339
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,500
The doctor said it can be cured if he undergoes surgery in time.

340
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,400
How can it be malignant?

341
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,600
He didn't even mention it to me.

342
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,000
He didn't tell anyone.

343
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,100
It was one time I went to the hospital and saw him go to neurosurgery,

344
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,100
I found out after investigating.

345
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,000
The doctor said...

346
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,600
Old Gao doesn't want to undergo surgery.

347
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,300
Why are you telling me?

348
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,200
What do you think?

349
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,300
L &amp; P is being sued.

350
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,900
Li Xun is doing it?

351
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,600
Finally.

352
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,600
It's very troublesome.

353
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,500
If he can't find a solution,

354
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,200
L &amp; P won't go public but will give compensation.

355
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,500
A lot of compensation.

356
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,200
What's worse, after Flying Network succeeds,

357
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
other companies will also sue L &amp; P one after another.

358
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,400
By then, L &amp; P will really collapse soon.

359
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,500
Aren't you about to resign?

360
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,100
How is it your business?

361
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,900
I don't want to interfere in it,

362
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,300
but I haven't sold my shares yet.

363
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,400
Think about it. Who would dare to take over once this has happened?

364
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,600
It's fine if I can't sell them by then,

365
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll just lose all my money and go to jail.

366
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,800
What should I do?

367
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
That's what you deserve.

368
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
Yes,

369
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,800
I really deserve it.

370
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,900
What about Old Gao?

371
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,300
Have you ever thought about Old Gao?

372
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,400
He did this, so he should be mentally prepared for it.

373
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
Xu Lina,

374
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,400
ask your heart whether Gao Jianhong treats you well.

375
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,800
He helped you when your family needed help most.

376
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Even if he does wrong, he has always been sincere to you.

377
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
You don't need to tell me these things.

378
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
He's in poor health,

379
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,700
but he doesn't want you to know this.

380
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,900
Only after this matter is completely settled can Old Gao undergo surgery in time.

381
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,300
You're his wife.

382
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,600
Do you want him to die?

383
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,000
What can I do?

384
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Go to see Zhu Yun and Li Xun.

385
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,600
They'll listen to me?

386
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Anyway, Old Gao used to be their old classmate.

387
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,000
You can go with Old Gao's medical record.

388
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,200
Tell them about Old Gao's disease and shift the blame onto Old Gao.

389
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,300
At most,

390
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,000
it would be best if we could persuade Li Xun to come and see him once.

391
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
That would be best.

392
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
You know little about Li Xun.

393
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,500
He won't listen to me.

394
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,000
I know little about Li Xun?

395
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,400
Do you think you know him well?

396
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
Li Xun's sister breathed her last in front of him,

397
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,600
so he must be traumatized by the death of people around him.

398
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
He usually looks cold

399
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
but is actually emotional.

400
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,200
This time,

401
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,800
I believe he'll show mercy.

402
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,800
Thank you.

403
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,100
Have a seat.

404
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
You don't need to avoid us.

405
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,300
Go ahead.

406
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,700
Under what conditions will you agree to withdraw the lawsuit?

407
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,800
Why should we withdraw the lawsuit?

408
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,600
Old Gao doesn't know that I'm here.

409
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,600
This is Gao's medical record.

410
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,500
This is his CT.

411
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,000
I didn't want to tell you,

412
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
but I couldn't think of any other way.

413
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,400
Brain glioma.

414
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,100
Malignant.

415
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,300
If you don't withdraw the lawsuit, Gao won't undergo surgery.

416
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,000
I hope...

417
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,200
you can show mercy to him.

418
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
He won't tell anyone.

419
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,900
If he knew I was here,

420
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,900
he probably wouldn't like it.

421
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,400
Fang Zhijing asked you to see us?

422
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,300
No.

423
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,300
He told me,

424
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,000
but it was my decision to come today.

425
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
He has kept a photo of all three of you together.

426
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,800
I have no choice.

427
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,000
Old Gao must undergo surgery immediately,

428
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,200
but this lawsuit won't let him go.

429
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,800
I decided to come myself.

430
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
Old Gao really doesn't know.

431
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,000
He has always wanted to compete with you.

432
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,400
Actually, I've never done anything for him these years.

433
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,100
He doesn't have many days left.

434
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't want to have any regret.

435
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,800
Zhu Yun,

436
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,200
persuade Li Xun.

437
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Living with hatred is very tiring.

438
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,800
He's wasted four years.

439
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
Don't waste time on anyone else.

440
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,600
Throw it away.

441
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,800
Li Xun.

442
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,200
Zhu Yun,

443
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
do you think we are easy to bully?

444
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,100
Why does Fang Zhijing think we will cooperate with him?

445
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
You are so sure that Fang Zhijing sent her here?

446
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,400
Gao Jianhong will never bow his head to us, nor will he die!

447
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,200
It's malignant.

448
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,700
So?

449
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,300
Fang Shumiao called me.

450
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,900
She said that the legal affairs of L &amp; P hoped that we could sit down and talk.

451
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,400
As long as we reconcile with L &amp; P, price doesn't matter.

452
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,600
It must be Fang Zhijing's doing.

453
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,200
He is working with the shareholders to put pressure on us.

454
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,700
- Is it possible... 
 - No.

455
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay.

456
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,700
Then I will call and tell Fang Shumiao to give them a reply.

457
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,200
Fang Shumiao also said that the CSRC has asked L &amp; Pto provide additional materials.

458
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,000
The reason is that there is sufficient uncertainty in the future operating capacity of the target company's reorganization.

459
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,400
So we can refuse to meet them.

460
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Let's meet them.

461
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,100
Why can't we see them?

462
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,790
   

463
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,510
What are you doing?

464
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,990
They're waiting for you.

465
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,700
According to the 4th stratagem of the "Art of War,"

466
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,180
we should wait at ease and conserve strength

467
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,860
wear down the enemy, and wait for the enemy to be exhausted before giving a head-on blow.

468
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,320
What have you learned every day?

469
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,070
I learned it from you.

470
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,820
Why haven't you learned my strengths?

471
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,340
Hurry up. Don't occupy the reception room.

472
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,570
Settle the matter as soon as possible.

473
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:55,130
Lawyer He's client will come later.

474
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,200
I'll follow your orders.

475
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,930
Long time no see, Monitor Fang.

476
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,970
Long time no see.

477
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,530
Mr. Gao,

478
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,850
you are becoming less and less gentlemanly.

479
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,950
Lawyer Fang, where's your client?

480
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,750
Mr. Li has no time and entrusted me with carte blanche to talk about the lawsuit.

481
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,450
Actually, many investors want to invest in Flying these days.

482
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,700
Today some investors have gone to see Mr. Li.

483
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,300
If you want to see him, you have to take a number.

484
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,620
I see.

485
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,090
Let's get straight to the point.

486
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,670
As a leading enterprise in the game industry,

487
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,420
L &amp; P has always been devoted to supporting small game companies in the industry.

488
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,030
In order to create a good industry environment,

489
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:23,490
we can spend 30 million yuan in supporting the small game companies represented by you.

490
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,780
What's your requirement?

491
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,210
You withdraw the trumped-up charges against L &amp; P.

492
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,010
A trumped-up accusation against L &amp; PCompany willing to spend 30 million?

493
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,720
Aren't you worried that you'll be always blackmailed?

494
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:44,790
Lawyer Fang, a rumor will become a fact after it's spread many times.

495
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,310
Besides, too many companies are jealous of L &amp; P.

496
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,100
People are always interested in ridiculous stunts.

497
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,870
Ah, right.

498
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:01,500
Well, for your accusation, we also reserve the right to counter sue you for defamation

499
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,450
Of course, as I said,

500
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:09,340
as a big brother, L &amp; P always hopes to lead everyone forward together.

501
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,960
We are also more generous.

502
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,180
We can spend 30 million yuan in solving a problem,

503
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,480
but for you, it's different.

504
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
We...

505
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:29,700
As lawyers, we need to give priority to the interests of our clients.

506
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,160
You're entrusted with a class action.

507
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,500
Shouldn't you ask the other party's opinion first?

508
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,720
Is Lawyer Wang teaching me how to do things?

509
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,900
Miss Fang, to tell you the truth,

510
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,020
actually, our opening conditions are already very generous.

511
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,300
You can persuade your clients.

512
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,010
Whether it's an excellent deal isn't up to you.

513
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,080
What's more, you should have paid it in compensation long before.

514
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,240
You haven't been a lawyer for long, have you?

515
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,750
I investigated you.

516
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,430
You're not a trained lawyer.

517
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,560
You switched to the profession of a lawyer after passing

518
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
the National Unified Legal Professional Qualification Examination and didn't receive higher education.

519
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,000
No wonder you don't know the rules.

520
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,490
Your greediness may break down our negotiation,

521
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,220
and you'll harm your clients' interests.

522
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,450
I can't compare to you, Lawyer Wang.

523
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:35,050
After studying law for seven years, you're only good at doing evil for tyrants.

524
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,790
Lawyer Wang, go out.

525
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,440
I want to talk with my old classmate alone.

526
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,510
Okay.

527
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:13,040
Why did Li Xun suddenly ask you to see me?

528
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,010
Xu Lina went to see Li Xun and Zhu Yun.

529
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,340
They know you're ill.

530
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,700
No wonder you're here.

531
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,580
Li Xun never wastes time on something meaningless.

532
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,280
If he decides to put it off until the last minute,

533
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,160
he won't give anyone a chance to speak.

534
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,180
He asked you to come because he has been swayed.

535
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,630
But I don't need it.

536
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,350
I don't want his pity.

537
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,840
Do you know why I dared copy the "Blind Box of Love" directly?

538
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,950
Because you had no choice.

539
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:08,070
Have you ever wondered why I dared to copy it directly?

540
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,340
Hello, Miaomiao.

541
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,660
 Zhu Yun, Li Xun has decided to drop the lawsuit. 

542
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,390
When?

543
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,600
 Just now. 

544
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,700
So suddenly.

545
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,460
You've reached an agreement?

546
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,670
 Zhu Yun, be strong. 

547
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,800
 I sent you a video. 

548
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,090


549
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,910
   

550
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,780
 Does he want Zhu Yun to be discredited? 

551
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,230
 Does he really care about someone? 

552
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,460
 Before I die, I must defeat him once! 

553
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,130
 Tell me whether you regret or not! 

554
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,630
 I'll go on fighting against him! 

555
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,800
 Do you also stand by him? 

556
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,130
 Zhu Yun, why did we become like this? 

557
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,620
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

558
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,540
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫
