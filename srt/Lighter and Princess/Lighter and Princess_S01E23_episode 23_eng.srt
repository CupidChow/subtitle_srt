00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,516
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,570
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,560
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,340
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,339
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:04,240
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,720
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,984
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,530
   

21
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,980
   

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,000
   

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,636
   

24
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,040
- Li Xun. 
 - Here.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,830
Someone is visiting you.

26
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,646
I contacted several lawyers.

27
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:23,328
They said if you make an appeal in the second trial, the prison term may be shortened.

28
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you come here for?

29
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,322
I want to help you.

30
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:32,900
No need.

31
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,966
So this is your plan, the thing you hid from me. Right?

32
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,248
Everything you did,

33
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,372
and all your abnormal acts

34
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,384
were to push me away

35
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:51,606
and avenge Fang Zhijing alone. Right?

36
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,990
Princess... you're very smart.

37
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,024
When did you start this plan?

38
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:16,900
From the very beginning.

39
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,770
To be exact,

40
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,904
from the night when I stood at your family's door six years ago.

41
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,210
You didn't expect it?

42
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,550
Or you can't understand it?

43
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,336
You just can't understand some things,

44
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,630
because you have never met with any misfortune.

45
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,600
Without money for medical expenses, my mom was transferred from ICU to a general ward

46
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,270
and she died.

47
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,670
To save money, Li Lan stayed in a hotel in remote suburbs

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,680
and she also died.

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
In your eyes, I am just a person begging and waiting for mercy

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,960
at the door of your family.

51
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,832
Do you still remember what I said?

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,260
You're so hypocritical.

53
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,710
You started a relationship with me

54
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,220
only to meet

55
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,900
your compassion that you think is noble.

56
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,930
Right?

57
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,670
You hate Fang Zhijing so much,

58
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,470
but you and he are the same kinds of people.

59
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,502
You're taking revenge on me.

60
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,380
I first saw you in front of your villa.

61
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
I thought we wouldn't meet again.

62
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,832
Unexpectedly,

63
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,110
we were admitted to the same university and studied the same major.

64
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,340
I didn't plan to provoke you,

65
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,046
but you pestered me.

66
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,284
I pestered you?

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,240
Okay.

68
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,832
Why did you let me pester you?

69
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,810
Because of Blue Crown.

70
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,840
Zhang Xiaobei could steal a project as she wanted,

71
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,150
but your parents could get it back easily.

72
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,108
At that time, I found that

73
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,130
your family was quite influential.

74
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,110
I found out that your father engages in medical devices.

75
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,828
This is a profitable industry.

76
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,170
Do you know?

77
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,160
Increase the cancer cure rate by 1%.

78
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,160
L&amp;P's dream

79
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,760
was also customized for me.

80
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,450
♫  And returning it to time with your bare hands  ♫

81

♫  There is nowhere to hide  ♫

84
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,220
have nothing to do with you.

♫  Looking back  ♫

86
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,390
Yeah.

87
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,780
Why am I so silly?

88
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,844
♫  I admit the way I look in your eyes  ♫

89

Leave.

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,390
Don't come here again.

91
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,260
Li Xun,

92
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,270
you said

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,400

Just consider me a betrayer.

97
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,294
Anyway, it's not

98
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,490
binding on me.

99
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,470
It doesn't matter if I go to hell.

100
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,522
I am experienced.

101
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,510
After all, I've visited it many times since childhood.

102

♫  And pretending to forget  ♫

Almost.

129
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,128
After you graduate, it'll be hard to gather so many people.

130
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:40,618
This may be the last time you meet in this life.

131
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:44,788
No one thought it would be impossible for us to all gather together now.

132
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,742
Did you make that, monitor?

133
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:55,420
She needs to appear in the graduation photo.

134
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,400
Or how would we prove that she studied with us for four years?

135
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,880
Come on.

136

 Three years later, Ren Di must be popular. 

167
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,030
 By then, songs of Light Red will be spread everywhere. 

168
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,510
 Three years later, I'll graduate as a postgraduate. 

169
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,110
 I'll be nothing. 

170
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,200
 Zhu Yun, your company may not surpass Google 

171
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,260
 but at least it will match the BAT three years later. 

172
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:20,050
 As for Wu Mengxing, I hope you can have a happy marriage. 

173
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,900
 I must see your name on the Forbes China Celebrity List by then. 

174
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,530
 - Okay? 
 - Okay, just wait and see. 

175
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,840
 Okay.

 The further you go, the more you deviate. 

183
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,930
♫  ...our separate ways  ♫

184
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,800
I know that the main business of our company is medical treatment due to various reasons.

185
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,758
You are the seniors of L&amp;P.

186
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,780
However, the company's future development direction needs to be adjusted.

187
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,680
After all, we're not a charitable company.

188
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,970
So we decide to remove this business segment.

189
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,050
Thank you for your understanding.

190
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,810
Mr. Gao... just tell us directly.

191
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,670
Did you sell our medical software?

192
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,180
Yes. I did sell it.

193
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,530
It's not a secret.

194
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,440
The medical industry requires heavy investment and a high professional technology threshold.

195
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,690
And it doesn't generate yield in a short time.

196
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:14,190
A small company like us can't support it.

197
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,550
We're a small horse.

198
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,490
We can't pull such a big carriage.

199
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,400
It depends on the horse's strength.

200
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,500
You're right.

201
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,520
I can tell you honestly that

202
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,940
the source of funds for the company's development in the next step is the payment for this software.

203
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,810
Of course, it also includes your severance pay.

204
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,320
- Financial executive. 
 - I got it, Mr. Gao.

205
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,260
About the compensation, the financial executive will talk about it with you.

206
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't worry. I won't treat you unfairly.

207
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,890
- Please. 
 - This way, please.

208
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,420
Mr. Gao.

209
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,880
- Everyone. 
 - Mr. Gao.

210
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,001
This is not the first time we meet,

211
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:10,860
but I still want to introduce myself.

212
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,780
My name is Gao Jianhong. I am the company's new shareholder, legal person and general manager.

213
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,180
There's a question that's been bothering me lately.

214
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,770
I was thinking what the goal of L&amp;P is.

215
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:33,639
Today, I can tell you clearly our goal is to make a profit.

216
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,460
What is most profitable?

217
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,840
Online education or shared commerce?

218
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,910
You can air your opinions.

219
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,190
Let's decide on the company's new direction together.

220
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,190
After working with me for some time, you will know that I am very open-minded.

221
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,280
I want to make money together with you.

222
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,150
Let's work together towards the new dream of L&amp;P.

223
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,126
 Good! Good! Good! 

224
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,670
I've made an appointment with several investors.

225
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,940
Go on with your work.

226
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,840
Okay. Okay, Mr. Gao.

227
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,850
   

228
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,630
   

229
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,860
   

230
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,280
Old Gao.

231
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,050
I heard that you refused to appeal.

232
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,138
- Zhu Yun has gone abroad. 
 - It has nothing to do with me.

233
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:15,308
Do you have to do this?

234
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:18,640
Will Zhu Yun know everything you did for her?

235
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,840
Have you completed the change of business registration?

236
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,930
It was completed yesterday.

237
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,570
Old Gao,

238
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,080
we will talk about work only, let's not talk about the past.

239
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,462
Do you want me to come to this kind of place to report to you in the future?

240
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:49,926
I have to warn you that

241
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:53,180
we can only talk about the past.

242
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,840
Do you think you will have a future?

243
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,140
Li Xun... don't blame me.

244
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,616
I used to give up everything.

245
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,620
Going abroad, postgraduate studies,

246
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,840
everything that our school recommended.

247
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,759
I put down my pride and self-esteem and even gave up my love.

248
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,360
I just wanted to stay far away from you.

249
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,250
But you didn't even give me the chance.

250
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,556
Think about what you have done these years.

251
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,380
Did you ever consider others' feelings when you made a decision?

252
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,888
Who did you really care about?

253
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,430
I really hate you sometimes.

254
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,498
How could you be so selfish and so arrogant?

255
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,740
You wanted to say these words long ago, right?

256
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,660
Does it feel good to endure humiliation?

257
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,270
No,

258
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,338
to submit to humiliation and ask for insults.

259
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,330
It's not important.

260
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,400
What's important is that I succeeded.

261
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,030
Do you see it clearly?

262
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,592
I'm telling you, your system has been sold.

263
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:38,106
I don't want an online medical system.

264
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:42,728
Just take everything you did as an initial step for my startup.

265
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,232
Li Xun, now L&amp;P has nothing to do with you.

266
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:51,118
Let your 1% go to hell.

267
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,004
You have lost.

268
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,180
Don't judge too soon.

269
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,450
There's a long way ahead.

270
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,458
I can take back...

271
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,298
what I gave to you.

272
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,790
Li Xun, that's the way you are.

273
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,364
You think you're superior even when you're in prison.

274
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,722
You have such an end not because of anyone.

275
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,770
Don't blame Fang Zhijing or me.

276
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,240
It is because you asked for it. You deserved it.

277
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,950
By the way,

278
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,454
do you know how Fang Zhijing found your sister?

279
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,700
I told him.

280
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,002
What did you say?

281
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,990
What did you say?

282
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,610
Li Xun.

283
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,580
Gao Jianhong!

284
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,230
- I'm waiting for you. 
 - Calm down.

285
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,140
There is a library and computers in the prison.

286
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,128
Enjoy your time.

287
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,670
The new hairstyle suits you very well.

288
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,058
I will kill you!

289
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,220
Calm down.

290
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,128
Go. Take him back.

I know you want to beat that person severely

The key is, do you have to ruin your life for such a person?

309

 Of course, as some said, at most, you can monopolize traffic, 

322
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,020

00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:44,260
I came for Gao Jianhong.

325
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:49,100
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

326
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,020
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

327
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,580
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

328
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,180
♫  With the same stubbornness, dreaming the same dream  ♫

329
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,860
♫  Wherever I go, I just want to wander with you  ♫

330
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,860
♫  My princess will never be sad again  ♫

331
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,380
♫  If I am the king  ♫

332
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,220
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

333
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,940
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

334
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,480
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

335
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,270
- When did he get out? 
 - A few days ago.

336
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,580
A few days ago?

337
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,114
How could he get out so soon?

338
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,648
Reduced sentence.

339
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,930
How could he get such a reduced sentence? How long has it been?

340
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,470
More than three years.

341
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,440
He was in prison only after blinding me.

342
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,366
Fang Zhijing, do you have to be so scared?

343
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,880
Well. Aren't you afraid?

344
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,014
Why should I be afraid?

345
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,290
How could he get out at this time?

346
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,710
Our company is going to be listed.

347
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,830
No mistake can occur at this crucial moment.

348
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,252
Li Xun seeks revenge for the smallest grievance.

349
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:21,510
He came to our company today.

350
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,670
I am afraid he can make a comeback.

351
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,840
- What does he have? 
 - What does he have?

352
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,828
I think you know it better than me.

353
00:29:29,828 --> 00:29:34,006
No matter how capable he is, he can't turn the table.

354
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:37,350
Three years. This industry is changing fast.

355
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,400
In three years, a generation of people engaged in the internet can be replaced

356
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,800
and everything he learned can all be washed away.

357
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,952
Even so, he can still learn.

358
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,860
I didn't expect for you to have so much confidence in your old enemy.

359
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,236
I'm not kidding.

360
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,720
Then let him come at us.

361
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,420
Fang Zhijing, look at this place.

362
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,730
Look at this building. Look at how many people and resources you have.

363
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,710
And look at him. What does he have?

364
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,190
We spent three years making these achievements.

365
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,500
Don't tell me that with such achievements made, you still don't have the courage to fight him.

366
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,188
You don't have to be sneering at me.

367
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,722
After all,

368
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,270
it's you who did it

369
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,400
and you have to pay for it.

370
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,460
But no matter what happens, we're on the same boat now.

371
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,796
I hope you can win.

372
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,390
Let's drink a toast to us, three rich girls.

373
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,918
Cheers. Cheers.

374
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,560
Zhu Yun, we three gathered because you've come back home.

375
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,060
Though Ren Di and I are in the same city, I couldn't meet her as often as her fans.

376
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,590
What a bad friend.

377
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,400
It's not true. You are a busy lawyer.

378
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,220
You don't have time to meet us. Right?

379
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,840
But, Fang Shumiao, it's pretty wicked of you to cross boundaries.

380
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,796
You majored in computer science and now you have become a lawyer.

381
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:31,100
She did not major in computer science in university.

382
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,020
- She majored in the student union. 
 - That's right.

383
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,010
People have to keep correcting their trajectory.

384
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,682
I think the lawyer profession suits me very well.

385
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:44,420
What's the name of your law firm?

386
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,100
My law firm is very famous in Shanghai.

387
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,490
Its name consists of the family names of the three founders.

388
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,970
My boss's family name is He, and my master's family name is Yuan.

389
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:57,434
You know what? Our boss, Lawyer He, is really handsome.

390
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,240
It's a pity that he is married.

391
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,070
He married his first love who he met in university.

392
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,830
Like you, his wife is a talent returning home.

393
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,080
What is that? It's blinking.

394
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,010
Then you don't understand what she means.

395
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:21,822
She's trying to tell you that being a lawyer is a very profitable profession.

396
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:25,670
Don't talk nonsense. We don't buy diamond rings for ourselves.

397
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,258
Which boss bought it for you?

398
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:32,648
This one has to be returned after wearing it for two days.

399
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:36,190
The gift of such a large amount of property, it must be notarized to be effective.

400
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,950
I don't plan to marry him. I need to return it if we break up.

401
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,830
I'm really a bit reluctant to return it.

402
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,340
Look, it's blinking. So beautiful.

403
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,820
Do not show it off. I'm going to be jealous. Enough, enough.

404
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,630
When you break up, I'll introduce a good man to you.

405
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,870
Fang Shumiao, your life is so varied.

406
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,146
It's colorful.

407
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:59,830
Come on. Stop showing it off. I will be jealous.

408
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,450
We have a boy classmate named... Wu Mengxing.

409
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,680
Wu Mengxing.

410
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,340
I heard that he cried sadly hugging you when we graduated.

411
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,580
Are you still in touch?

412
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,290
He's now working at the Municipal College Youth League Committee.

413
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,620
He has a bright future.

414
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,920
I have a case stuck there.

415
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,690
So you have made up your mind and plan to lure him?

416
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,380
Don't talk nonsense. He's going to have a child. Okay?

417
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,114
So we can't hear the suona solo again.

418
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,068
Well, this party, tell us about you.

419
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:35,688
How did you feel when you saw your old lover?

420
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:38,660
You went back to the university to try your luck to meet him. Right?

421
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,820
Of course not. I went back to the university as I am about to leave.

422
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,840
I didn't expect that...

423
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,520
Why are you staring at me? Are you interrogating me?

424
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,590
Is that an occupational disease of lawyers?

425
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,450
It's not an occupational disease, but curiosity and gossip about an incredible story.

426
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,120
I don't have any gossip. I'll leave tomorrow.

427
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,450
I'm leaving the country in two days, I can't act in these bloody dramas.

428
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,010
Is Li Xun still handsome now?

429
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,150
He's not as handsome as Wu Mengxing.

430
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,830
What are you whispering?

431
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,170
- What did you say? 
 - A toast to Wu Mengxing.

432
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,450
A toast to Wu Mengxing.

433
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,260
Why drink a toast to Wu Mengxing?

434
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,621
Just drink a toast to him. Just drink a toast to him. Toast. Toast.

435
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:25,510
A toast to him for his wealth.

436
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,364
A toast. A toast. A toast to Fang Shumiao.

437
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,270
Your coffee.

438
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,870
Thanks.

439
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,110
Thanks.

440
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,230
Didn't you sleep well last night?

441
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,738
Not bad.

442
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,000
You've gotten your purse back. Why are you still unhappy?

443
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,638
I'm not.

444
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:30,530
Do you know why Li Xun took away the key and then returned it?

445
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,130
Why?

446
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,312
He took away the important object because he cares;

447
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:42,508
he returned it because he has put it down.

448
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,490
A man revisited an old place to recall the past, grasp the present,

449
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,690
and look into the future.

450
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,764
At last, he decided to resolutely move on alone.

451
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,010
That's quite sentimental.

452
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,660
I'm driving.

453
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,700
- Hello, Mom. 
 - Hello, Yun.

454
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,204
Are you with Xiuzhu?

455
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:39,912
He's beside me.

456
00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:41,700
That's good.

457
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,940
Your dad wanted me to call to ask when you will arrive.

458
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,476
We'll arrive soon.

459
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:52,900
Okay. Okay, okay. I'll make more delicious dishes for you.

460
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,740
She's is rushing us.

461
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,640
 The 14th Internet Conference will have a grand opening in the next few days. 

462
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,470
 The conference is organized by L&amp;P. 

463
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,920
 As the city's leading internet enterprise, 

464
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,750
 L&amp;P takes the lead among other game companies as usual. 

465
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,350
 It has become a benchmarking enterprise of self-developed games in China. 

466
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,070
 Your two old classmates are doing really well. 

467
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,550
 L&amp;P will speed up its efforts to upgrade the new version 

468
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,390
 and overseas distribution of its current games. 

469
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,290
 It is committed to bringing Chinese games to the world. 

470
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,060
 Thank you. I'm here to take the money. 

471
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,042
 This is for Li Xun? 

472
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,000
Li Xun was not supposed to ask Ren Di for money.

473
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,840
 It is positioned to empower various lines and industries through the internet. 

474
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,050
 This will contribute to China's Internet Industry. 

475
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,030
Li Xun is L&amp;P's major shareholder.

476
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,260
He should not be short of money by reason.

477
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,100
Why did he ask Ren Di for money after he was released from prison?

478
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,230
It is indeed a bit strange.

479
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,300
 It has built a bridge of efficient communication 

480
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,550
 for whole-chain enterprises and related institutions and professionals, 

481
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,220
 creating a high-end communication platform 

482
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,240
 that has sustainable and healthy development ability and wide industry influence. 

483
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,820
What's wrong?

484
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,260
Li Xun is not on the list of shareholders.

485
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,970
Did he entrust someone to hold shares on behalf of him?

486
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,990
If the media knew that L&amp;P's biggest shareholder

487
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,794
served a sentence in prison, it would be bad for L&amp;P's development.

488
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:27,610
It is possible. But Fang Zhijing is on the list of shareholders.

489
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,740
Fang Zhijing?

490
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,660
The person who was blinded by Li Xun?

491
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,000
No matter what happens, Li Xun will not forgive Fang Zhijing,

492
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,420
nor will he cooperate with him.

493
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,716
I need to go back.

494
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,540
How about I go in with you?

495
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,200
No need.

496
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,000
In fact,

497
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,230
you have nothing to do with them now.

498
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,370
I'm not doing this for anyone. I also invested efforts in L&amp;P before.

499
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,700
I need to figure out what's going on.

500
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,820
Mr. Gao.

501
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,032
It's been a long time, old classmate.

502
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,450
It's been a long time.

503
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,850
Let's go. I'll show you around.

504
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,450
Zhu Yun, you must know that I'm working on games now.

505
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,500
This is the Project Department. Look at the hardware.

506
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,010
I require them to update the hardware to the highest configuration every six months.

507
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,520
A handy tool makes a handy man.

508
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,940
When we were frogs in a well in the base back then, we felt proud.

509
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,150
Now, I finally know "behind an able man there are always other able men."

510
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,590
This is the Planning Department. They quarrel in the conference room every day.

511
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,650
After they quarrel in the conference room, they quarrel in the office.

512
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,450
Even a dozen conference rooms aren't enough for them.

513
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,030
I'm going to change the two upper floors into an open space.

514
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,790
There should be at least two brainstorming sessions behind closed doors every month.

515
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,910
The Legal Department is downstairs.

516
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,880
I didn't realize it would be too expensive to keep a lawyer until I started a company.

517
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,190
It costs several million a year, but my tree attracts the wind and I have to keep one.

518
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,760
I'll show you around downstairs.

519
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,360
Old Gao.

520
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,180
Let's have a talk in a private room.

521
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,660
Okay.

522
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,280
Zhu Yun, what do you think of my company?

523
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,560
I know you graduated from a famous university, and you're knowledgeable.

524
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,490
But I won't treat you as an employee if you work in my company.

525
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,450
I'll share some options with you.

526
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,450
Why does Fang Zhijing's name appear in the list of shareholders of L&amp;P?

527
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,392
So you're here to question me.

528
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,270
Why does Fang Zhijing's name appear in the list of shareholders of L&amp;P?

529
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,900
Why can't his name appear on the list?

530
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
Fang Zhijing is not only L&amp;P's shareholder,

531
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,901
but also L&amp;P's vice president, chief technology officer, and my partner.

532
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,004
Old Gao, what happened?

533
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:14,130
Three years ago, Li Xun excluded me and entrusted the company to you.

534
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,260
You know every well everything that happened between us and Fang Zhijing.

535
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,070
What you did is like putting a knife to him.

536
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,626
I just want to put a knife to him.

537
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,610
What?

538
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,006
Old Gao, whatever happened between you and Li Xun,

539
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:34,900
Fang Zhijing can't stay in L&amp;P.

540
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,990
This is Li Xun's company.

541
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,766
This is my company!

542
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,260
You checked L&amp;P's equity structure, so you should clearly see that

543
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,570
Li Xun does not hold any shares in L&amp;P.

544
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,320
When he was put in prison, he transferred all your shares to me.

545
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,172
And I sold your online medical system.

546
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,669
So from then on, Li Xun no longer had anything to do with L&amp;P.

547
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:02,300
You occupied L&amp;P by making use of Li Xun's trust in you.

548
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,940
I should have known that this was not his company.

549
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,200
Li Xun wouldn't destroy L&amp;P's future and reputation in order to make money.

550
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,396
Whatever you say.

551
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,746
Anyway, I have the final say in L&amp;P now.

552
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,460
He will not let you go.

553
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,260
To be honest, since we were in university,

554
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,600
I've been looking forward to a life-and-death contest with Li Xun.

555
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,334
The result of the contest is going to be unbearable.

556
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:40,940
Even if Li Xun did something wrong, he was sincere to you.

557
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,110
You're still the same as before, not giving anyone any chance.

558
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:49,450
You always stand at Li Xun's side without conditions.

559
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,250
Compared with the pain and suffering he has caused me since university,

560
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,000
this cut in him is far from enough.

561
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,066
You can't beat him.

562
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:17,094
I admit he's a genius, but we can have a lot of geniuses in this era.

563
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,700
Things are different from they were in our university time.

564
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,288
L&amp;P has many geniuses like him.

565
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:24,230
I can have many geniuses as I want.

566
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,130
What can he rely on to beat me?

567
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,812
But you forget one thing.

568
00:43:29,812 --> 00:43:32,360
There are many geniuses in this era,

569
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,844
but there's only one Li Xun.

570
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:38,566
And there's only one Gao Jianhong.

571
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:51,000


572
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,010
   

573
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,120
 If you say you regret it now, 

574
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,700
 I'll consider letting you go. 

575
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,600
 From today on, 

576
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,900
 I will take L&amp;P back. 

577
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,230
 What? 

578
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,750
 You've been in prison? 

579
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,090
 Who do you attract to the company every day? 

580
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,910
 Miss Zhu. 

581
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,520
 What a coincidence. I haven't seen you for a long time. 

582
