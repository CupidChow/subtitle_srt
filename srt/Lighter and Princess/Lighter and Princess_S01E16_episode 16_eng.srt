1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,820
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,380
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,630
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,720
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,100
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,010
Oh, thank you so much.

23
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,720
It's nothing.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,740
I've added lots of WeChat accounts.

25
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,830
Come on. I specially booked crisp pastries.

26
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,100
They taste so good. They're quite famous in Shanghai.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,350
Come and have a taste. Everyone can have a taste.

28
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,740
Come on. Let me give you this.

29
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,000
Let others taste it. Let the others taste it.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
Well, come here. Come here.

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,730
Is it tasty? How does it taste?

32
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,100
It tastes good. Let me give you this.

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,310
I think this restaurant is good.

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,090
There is also one portion. This one.

35
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,690
Take it.

36
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,050
Thank you.

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,000
Have a taste.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,640
It tastes good.

39
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,200
It tastes very good.

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
I entered the final, Li Xun.

41
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,570
Thank you very much this time.

42
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,630
Thank you.

43
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,280
Not at all.

44
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,110
Thank you for giving me advice. Thank you so much.

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,800
It doesn't matter.

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,390
Are you Zhu Yun?

47
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,970
I heard from Old Gao that you're also the main member of the Nanhu University Base.

48
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,440
May I have your WeChat account?

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,360
Let me scan your QR code.

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,540
Old Gao showed me the source codes of your Blue Crown app a few days ago.

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,530
The source codes were concise and accurate.

52
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,210
It's a pity that you aren't participating in this competition.

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,210
But participating in this competition is also a stomach full of anger.

54
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,530
What do you mean?

55
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,990
Some players who dig doors and steal holes for a competition are really knowledgeable.

56
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,260
Do you mean our senior?

57
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,950
He's simply the shame of the School of Information Technology of our university.

58
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,040
It was rumored that his mentor had cooperated with a sponsor.

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,590
Knowing they set up a new studio recently,

60
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,740
his mentor and sponsor got several topics in advance.

61
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,880
When they almost finished them, they invited some students to do it.

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,050
To sell patents and earn rankings.

63
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,410
I can't even admire them.

64
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,320
 Fang Zhijing, 

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,970
 who won the Special Attention Award in this competition, come to the state and press the crystal ball with us. 

66
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,670
Is he that student we saw on stage?

67
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,360
Yes. It's him. Fang Zhijing.

68
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,000
Who are you talking about?

69
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,110
Junior Sister.

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,490
Why didn't you invite me to dinner?

71
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,670
You were too busy to have dinner with us.

72
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,470
Zhu Yun!

73
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,810
It's really you.

74
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,430
I remember you were at Nanhu University.

75
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,210
Well, you should have told me you would come to our university,

76
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,260
so that I could do the honors.

77
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,160
Can't you recognize me?

78
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,570
I'm Fang Zhijing.

79
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,360
Long time no see, Fang Zhijing.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,780
You're also here for the competition?

81
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,240
I didn't see your name on the list.

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,230
Were you eliminated?

83
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,570
It's funny.

84
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,420
Everyone can make the Blue Crown app but can not participate in the final?

85
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,060
You must be Li Xun.

86
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,890
Hello. Nice to meet you.

87
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,910
I'm Fang Zhijing.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Your Blue Crown app turns out to be a success,

89
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,540
but it's buggy every now and then.

90
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,810
It would be better if it could run smoothly.

91
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,290
It doesn't matter.

92
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,260
You're freshmen, so it's normal for you to have some weaknesses.

93
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,960
Yes, it's normal.

94
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,610
Its DAUs are ten times more than the expected ones.

95
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,670
So we still need to upgrade the server.

96
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,870
It's a pity that we can't fight it out in the competition this time.

97
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,200
Well, enjoy yourselves.

98
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
By the way, Zhu Yun.

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,170
Please tell me in advance before coming to our university next time.

100
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,770
Such a supercilious guy will invite his destruction sooner or later.

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,010
Yeah, I'm here. Go upstairs directly.

102
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,470
Okay, bye.

103
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,230
Well, Zhu Yun, do you have something else to talk with me?

104
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,770
If there's nothing, I'll leave first. See you another day.

105
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,690
Do you still remember Xiaoyan?

106
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,670
Of course. I went to her gravesite during the Chinese New Year.

107
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,510
It's been so long.

108
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,160
I hope she is doing well in Heaven.

109
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,560
Honey, I'm coming.

110
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,410
Let me introduce to you.

111
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,400
This is my old classmate. Zhu Yun.

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,770
This is my girlfriend. Wu Yuxin.

113
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,270
Hello, Zhu Yun.

114
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,220
Let's go to dinner. Your teacher is still waiting for you.

115
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,460
Fine.

116
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,160
The competition is a mere formality, let alone the forum.

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,690
What do you mean by that?

118
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,230
I'm not interested in the forum,

119
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,850
but our project team has cooperated with the sponsor of this competition.

120
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,370
So they invited me to the launch ceremony.

121
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,980
I'm leaving.

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,430
I'm the first prize winner in this competition.

123
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,300
All right, just be quiet.

124
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,450
See you, Zhu Yun.

125
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,140
 You told her too much. 

126
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,870
 Don't worry. She can't do anything to me. 

127
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,080
 What would you like to eat today? 

128
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,550
Zhu Yun.

129
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,440
Where did you go?

130
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,130
What's the matter?

131
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,280
Let's go.

132
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,300
 Zhu Yun, we're leaving. 

133
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,550
Speak.

134
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,690
Let's join the competition.

135
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,050
It's a piece of cake for you.

136
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,140
As long as you take it a little seriously, you can win as easily as winking.

137
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,910
Why would I waste my time doing such an unimportant thing?

138
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,310
Li Xun, let's join the competition.

139
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,630
Why did you change your mind?

140
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,460
I just want to participate in it.

141
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,490
Tell me why.

142
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,780
Tell me why.

143
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,410
Won't you join?

144
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,660
No, I won't.

145
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,360
   

146
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,340
You're also fed up with him?

147
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,110
Don't laugh at me.

148
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,890
No, no.

149
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,750
It's normal. Ordinary girls can't stay with him for long.

150
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,600
Let me tell you that it's normal.

151
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,180
How is it normal?

152
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,050
Li Xun has his own plans for everything.

153
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,610
Let me tell you. I asked him to help me design music synthesis software.

154
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,530
He was not available for a month.

155
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,040
Later, I paid him and he did it for me like a business.

156
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,200
He's definitely going to start his own company.

157
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,080
What about him? It's not easy to trust others, and it's certainly not easy to accept investment.

158
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,780
So he needs to save money to start his company himself.

159
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,700
Well, why must you participate in the competition?

160
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,940
I just don't want that bastard to win.

161
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,900
I can't let him win first prize.

162
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,270
Who?

163
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,130
Fang Zhijing.

164
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,780
My best friend in high school was Liu Xiaoyan.

165
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,980
Xiaoyan was very close to a senior in Grade Two.

166
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,940
She had just told me about it.

167
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
   

168
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,110
 It's melting. Why don't you put it in the freezer and take it out later? 

169
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,740
 - No one will take it away. 
 - No. 

170
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,260
 What if someone else takes it? 

171
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,850
 He loves vanilla ice cream best. 

172
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,590
 You keep talking about him. 

173
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,590
 Who is he? 

174
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,850
 I'm here. 

175
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,980
 This is for you. 

176
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,610
 Vanilla ice cream. Thank you. 

177
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,990
 I haven't finished my homework. I'll leave first. 

178
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,240
 - Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye. 

179
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,300
 This was the last one. It was hard for me to get it. 

180
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,180
 I told you we should stay together secretly. 

181
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,800
It was also on that day that Liu Xiaoyan and Fang Zhijing's secret relationship

182
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,250
    
 was exposed on the school forum.

183
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,090
   

184
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,740
 What's up? 

185
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,710
 Someone posted it to the school forum. 

186
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,240
 I got it. 

187
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,130
 The IP address turns out to be our school computer room. 

188
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,700
 Someone in our school did it. 

189
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,670
 What a busybody. 

190
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,190
 Well, we can say we happened to go home together. 

191
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,430
 - My bike was broken, so... 
 - Our teachers won't believe it. 

192
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,390
 It's the critical moment for the selection of "Provincial Merit Student." 

193
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,990
 If it weren't for you, there wouldn't have been such a mess. 

194
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,120
Fang Zhijing was elected as the "Provincial Merit Student" for two consecutive years.

195
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,730
If he was elected thrice, he could be recommended to the Information Technology University directly.

196
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,290
But Fang Zhijing was criticized at school because of the photo.

197
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,680
Unexpectedly,

198
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,240
    
 Fang Zhijing released his chat information with Xiaoyan out of context

199
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,110
    
 in order to get the recommendation certificate

200
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,400
and shifted all the responsibilities onto Xiaoyan,

201
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,590
making her the target of public criticism.

202
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,520
   

203
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,480
 - She's so shameless! 
 - It's just her. 

204
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,040
   
 As good as she looks, she's such a nuisance. Stop pretending. 

205
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,850
 Xiaoyan. 

206
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,310
 Why did you post some of your QQ chat information with Xiaoyan and deliberately nip off the information unfavorable to you? 

207
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,810
 Did you see me do it? 

208
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,390
 And it's none of your business. 

209
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,170
 But it's not the truth. 

210
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,720
 It's you who plagued Xiaoyan. 

211
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,280
 Plague? 

212
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,920
 Do I plague her? 

213
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,960
 Xiaoyan is so kind to you, but you hurt her ruthlessly. 

214
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,690
 If so, why can't she sacrifice for me? 

215
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,490
 Xiaoyan is very sad now. Go and see her. 

216
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,740
 It's really inappropriate for us to meet now. 

217
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,850
 If others find out we are still together, I really won't be able to make it clear. 

218
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,800
 Then her sacrifice will become meaningless. 

219
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,780
 Then at least comfort her. 

220
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,940
 I said I have no relationship with her. Don't bother me again. 

221
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,770
 Fang Zhijing. 

222
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,250
 Fang Zhijing actually made a statement. 

223
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,250
 Fang Zhijing refuses her, but she still plagues him shamelessly. 

224
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,890
Xiaoyan seemed to live in darkness since that day.

225
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,660
Fang Zhijing was still a good student in everyone's eyes.

226
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,430
Xiaoyan became silent until one day...

227
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,030
 Zhu Yun, there is something wrong. 

228
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,240
 Liu Xiaoyan took sleeping pills. 

229
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,750
 - How is she? 
 - I don't know. She is still in the emergency room. 

230
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,480
 Liu Xiaoyan's family member? 

231
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,890
 I-I'm her mom. 

232
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,940
 The patient's central nervous system has been inhibited by a large number of sleeping pills. 

233
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,340
 Because of a long time of brain hypoxia, she has brain death. 

234
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,390
 It's of no use to rescue her again. 

235
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,820
 How could this happen? 

236
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,510
 Aunt. Aunt. Aunt. 

237
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,240
 - Aunt. 
 - Xiaoyan. 

238
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,280
 Xiaoyan! Xiaoyan... 

239
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,480
 My girl. 

240
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,250
 Fang Zhijing! 

241
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,980
 My girl. 

242
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,890
 What do you want to do? 

243
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,950
 You are so shameless. 

244
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,120
 You know Xiaoyan is shy. 

245
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,870
 When she was laughed at by other students, she still cared about your feelings. 

246
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,320
 But you confused right and wrong and caused her to be slandered by others for a recommendation certificate. 

247
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,660
 Do you have a conscience? 

248
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,370
 I didn't ask her to take the sleeping pills. 

249
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,130
 It's because she had psychological problems. 

250
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,960
 Am I to blame? 

251
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,770
 As soon as I heard about her accident, I rushed here. 

252
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,100
 I've done my utmost. 

253
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,590
 She killed herself because of you. 

254
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,430
 - It's you who killed her— 
  - Zhu Yun! 

255
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,970
 Does it all have anything to do with me? 

256
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,530
 You can't talk nonsense like this. 

257
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,160
The bad guys in the fairytale world would never come to a good end.

258
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,750
But we don't live in the fairytale world.

259
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,240
The bad guy enjoys a good life, with excellent studies and sweet love.

260
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,960
He feels as if nothing happened.

261
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,440
He has no sense of guilt.

262
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,890
Why?

263
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,040
Good people don't live long. The scourge of the millennium.

264
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,520
The results are everything.

265
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,210
I can't let him stand on the podium.

266
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,940
Never.

267
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,490
Why do you come to me suddenly? You look serious.

268
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,680
Old Gao, I want to participate in the Information Security Competition with you.

269
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,120
Okay. You said...

270
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,040
I changed my mind.

271
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,130
Okay. There are many groups in the competition.

272
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,300
To be honest, I'm a little unsure about it.

273
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,430
I thought to find helpers.

274
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,150
Do I need to register?

275
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,360
No. I can add your name directly.

276
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,210
I'll send you the project progress later.

277
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,670
Okay.

278
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,980
Zhu Yun, why do you want to join in the competition suddenly?

279
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,770
I want to win first place.

280
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,020
Good.

281
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,200
I'll go to meet Mr. Lin. Let's go together.

282
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,580
Let's go.

283
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,000
Look! You've done a good job.

284
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,480
Why are you panicking?

285
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,020
Do you think my project is good?

286
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,120
Yes, it's good.

287
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,100
This is the printed list of the finalists from various universities.

288
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,270
Have a look.

289
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,950
Mr. Lin, you already read it. So please help us analyze the opponent.

290
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,940
What are you analyzing?

291
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,720
There are only a few colleges and universities with strength in computer science.

292
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,000
There are also a few national defense schools.

293
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,480
There's nothing to analyze.

294
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,570
Remember, it depends on your real strength.

295
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,460
Read it yourself.

296
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,780
There's a strong group at the Information Technology University.

297
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,640
They made a practical.

298
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,510
It's estimated they can win a prize and profit from patent sales.

299
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,170
Is their group leader named Fang Zhijing? What's their competition topic?

300
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,300
Mr. Lin, it's time to have a meeting.

301
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,370
Okay.

302
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,180
Don't forget to close the door when you leave.

303
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,280
   

304
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,210
    
 USB Intelligent Encryption Interface.

305
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,970
Is his competition topic "USB Intelligent Encryption Interface"?

306
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,200
They made a practical.

307
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,790
If he wins this project and applies for a patent, I guess lots of enterprises will compete to buy it.

308
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,840
What's the matter?

309
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,210
Don't worry. Our project is not bad.

310
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,910
If we do it carefully, it's also competitive.

311
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,290
Old Gao, let's go and invite Li Xun to join us. Okay?

312
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,290
Why do you mention him suddenly?

313
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,680
He isn't interested in the competition.

314
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,970
I'll go and talk with him again.

315
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,440
We two can also make it.

316
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,660
You also want to win the first prize. Right?

317
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,180
With him, we can win it for sure.

318
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,530
Are you so unsure of yourself?

319
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,350
- No, but the final is drawing near. 
 - Or are you unsure of me?

320
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,420
That's not what I meant.

321
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,220
Whatever.

322
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,480
Go and ask him yourself.

323
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,150
But you should also consider another aspect of defending against ARP spoofing attacks.

324
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:44,290
Such an attack is always disguised as a gateway or a host in the network.

325
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,670
So you need to deploy some monitoring points in the network

326
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,480
to monitor the false ARP data packets,

327
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,840
find out the ARP attack source according to the false MAC

328
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,490
in the false ARP data and finally deal with the attack source.

329
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,570
   

330
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,730
   

331
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,870
   

332
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,850
   

333
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,390
We can't resist the flooding attacks at all.

334
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,420
As long as the attack source is slightly disguised, it can bypass our defense system.

335
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,740
I'll try again.

336
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,150
I'll go out to get some air.

337
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,330
Can you design the encryption interface of the USB device?

338
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,610
- What? 
 - Can you design the encryption interface of the USB device?

339
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,110
We work together every day.

340
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,510
What are you thinking about?

341
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,770
I'm serious. Can you design it?

342
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,840
If the encryption interface is only made for functions,

343
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,960
we can find a single-chip computer as the main processor

344
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,090
and equip it with some interface chips.

345
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,650
I'm not familiar with hardware,

346
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,400
so it may take some time to design it.

347
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,030
It's easy to design the software

348
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,370
as I just need to deal with the interface firmware and key management.

349
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,880
- Is it of high difficulty? 
 - Why do you ask me this?

350
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,180
Princess, do you want to receive an outsourced project for us?

351
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,270
You've improved.

352
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,570
You know how to find work for yourself.

353
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,970
I have to remind you.

354
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,690
Don't serve them at a low price. Charge high for it.

355
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,050
How long will it take you to finish it?

356
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,550
It depends on the offer.

357
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,960
- What if you are very, very satisfied with the offer? 
 -  Then it depends on the requirements.

358
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,490
I have very, very high requirements.

359
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,390
There're various kinds and degrees of encryption methods in the world.

360
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,740
Advanced encryption is a process of continuous improvements.

361
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,810
But it won't take long if it is only to realize the functions of the encryption interface.

362
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
What's up?

363
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,980
These are common sense questions.

364
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,940
Why do you ask me?

365
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,900
100,000 yuan.

366
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,980
Not enough.

367
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,880
This is just the deposit.

368
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,230
 He's bursting with joy. I know how much money you have. 

369
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,240
Princess, I guess there's no one-tenth of the deposit on your card.

370
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,150
How can you pay me?

371
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,560
So I said it's the deposit.

372
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,550
Let me calculate.

373
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,330
I try to transfer 2,000 yuan to the bank account every month to repay you the rest of the money.

374
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:47,220
So I can pay you 10,000 yuan in five months and 100,000 yuan in fifty months.

375
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,140
You can just wait to collect the money later.

376
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,720
What do you think?

377
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,960
Fifty months?

378
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,140
You want me to wait until the next life.

379
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,300
You're going to pay me a 100,000 yuan to make you a universal serial bus encryption?

380
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,670
No.

381
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,600
This is another's competition project.

382
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,040
All the people think he will win.

383
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,350
I want you to join me in the competition and defeat this project.

384
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,610
As long as you sign, we can make a deal.

385
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,100
After I repay you the deposit, you can still keep my salary card.

386
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,780
I will work for you for free, okay?

387
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,980
Are you serious?

388
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,470
Yes.

389
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,530
   

390
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,400
♫  If love remains warm  ♫

391
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,160
♫  This dream will automatically abort  ♫

392
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,460
♫  When you wake up, please stay  ♫

393
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,180
♫  Don't go, fate is not a journey  ♫

394
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,140
♫  Hold onto me, don't get lost  ♫

395
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,060
♫  It's the depth of one's soul  ♫

396
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,580
♫  You're my everything  ♫

397
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,780
♫  Take one step back and try to understand  ♫

398
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,640
♫  I care so much about you  ♫

399
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,530
   

400
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,070
I made it!

401
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,630
I made it!

402
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,720
I made it, I made it!

403
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,960
Everyone, I made it!

404
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,550
Zhu Yun, come here. Come now.

405
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,880
I made it. I've done a lot of tests.

406
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,830
Both flooding attacks and spoofing attacks can be detected by the system in real-time 
    

407
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,480
and the ARP attack source can be automatically isolated, 
    

408
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,740
which doesn't affect the normal communication between hosts.

409
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,460
Well done, Old Gao.

410
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,650
Barring accidents, I think we can at least win a prize this time.

411
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,520
We may also win the first prize.

412
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,340
Really?

413
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,700
Old Gao, let me in.

414
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,670
I'll copy the codes for you.

415
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,750
Why?

416
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,460
I didn't invite you.

417
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,380
This is my project.

418
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,450
Old Gao, I told you I would invite him.

419
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,490
We didn't make any progress back then. Now our project is almost completed.

420
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,050
Zhu Yun, why didn't you discuss with me before making a decision?

421
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,550
Let's talk outside.

422
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,290
He's a strong and excellent programmer, but I don't need him.

423
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,790
   

424
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,850
What's going on? Who launched the attack? 
    

425
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,290
Let me check.

426
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,980
No need.

427
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,080
Flooding attacks generate a large number of false MAC addresses in the network,

428
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,720
so you defend against them by the strategy of configuring switch ports.

429
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,050
Spoofing attacks will disguise themselves as gateways or hosts in the network.

430
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,400
You chose to deploy some monitoring points in the network

431
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,550
to detect false ARP data packets,

432
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,370
find out the ARP attack source according to the false MAC in the false ARP data

433
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,600
and finally deal with the attack source.

434
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,790
The idea is kind of feasible,

435
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,810
but you lack the necessary ability.

436
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:40,260
So, this system is full of loopholes from architecture design to the code level.

437
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,800
I broke through your defense system with only less than 20 lines of codes.

438
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,790
I passed the preliminary.

439
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:55,140
The preliminary stresses understanding of concepts, while the final stresses real strength.

440
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,760
Working night and day this month, you designed such a shabby project.

441
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,830
You still have the wild wish of winning the first prize.

442
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,150
The judges will teach you a bitter lesson.

443
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,480
- What do you actually want to do? 
 - Help you win the first prize.

444
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,420
I don't need you.

445
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,900
You can win...

446
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,050
only if you follow me.

447
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,710
Old Gao.

448
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,550
He is so arrogant and a show-off.

449
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,140
Mr. Lin, if I participate in the final myself, can I win?

450
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:06,390
Any contestant may win or fail in a competition.

451
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,480
I mean you'd better not put too much pressure on yourself.

452
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,140
You're a freshman.

453
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,610
You have lots of chances in the future.

454
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,710
There're all sorts of activities you can participate in

455
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,320
every semester and every school year.

456
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:37,250
There're regional, provincial, and city-level activities.

457
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,150
You have many chances to train yourself.

458
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:46,910
So, Mr. Lin, I can't win without his help. Right?

459
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,320
Jianhong, you...

460
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,230
Let me tell you about my own experience.

461
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,860
I'm one of the first students to learn this major in our country.

462
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,100
I remember the first time I got a computer,

463
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,720
I was so excited that I couldn't fall asleep all night.

464
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,730
I came out top in the academic performance in my class.

465
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,380
I retained to work at our university after graduation.

466
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,120
My classmates envied me

467
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,380
and thought I got the best chance.

468
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:41,220
Some of my classmates who weren't given satisfactory jobs went to Zhongguancun. 
  (Zhongguancun neighborhood of Beijing, containing Peking University, famous for electronics shops and bookstores) 

469
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,460
After a few years,

470
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,350
they became IT leaders.

471
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,120
If I'm compared with them now, whose chances are better?

472
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,330
Who wins?

473
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,830
Who seizes the better resources?

474
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:29,500
 Jianhong, you have a long life road. 

475
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:35,690
 Don't let yourself be trapped by temporary wins and losses. 

476
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,090
   

477
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,390
 One day, I will let you know 

478
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,530
 I can be better without his help. 

479
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,570
   

480
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,940
Let's lose no time.

481
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,500
Tell me how to amend the project.

482
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,540
What's your opinion?

483
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,740
If I say, I think we should rewrite all the codes.

484
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,940
We don't need to rewrite all of them.

485
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,550
Just reconstruct the codes with problems. Okay?

486
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,220
We must rewrite all of them.

487
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,610
We're pressed for time.

488
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,940
Your program is like a swimmer in cotton-padded clothes.

489
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,320
We can't find its bugs in the beginning,

490
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,290
but more bugs will occur with time going.

491
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,210
By then, we can do nothing to improve it.

492
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,710
I deleted the previous program,

493
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,630
so let's rewrite it.

494
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,620
Okay.

495
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,030
Old Gao, are you all right?

496
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,070
Yes.

497
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,820
Both of us want to win.

498
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,370
It's good that he can help us to win, isn't that so?

499
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,900
I've stayed up late for several days, so I'm a bit tired.

500
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,400
I'd like to have a rest in the dormitory.

501
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,810
Go back to rest early.

502
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,260
Go to sleep in the dormitory.

503
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,510
I have no time to sleep.

504
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,690
Li Xun, be kind to Old Gao later.

505
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,450
Am I unkind to him?

506
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,200
He is still the project leader.

507
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,250
It's still he who will introduce the project in the competition.

508
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,210
Am I kind enough to him?

509
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,230
What are you doing?

510
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,300
I'm putting up a bed for you.

511
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,550
Sleep on such a bed?

512
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,450
It's a bit like a farewell ceremony.

513
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,610
You may die from overwork if you keep staying up late.

514
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,760
You stay up late more often than me.

515
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,920
Don't compare with me.

516
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,550
Come here.

517
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,330
Come here.

518
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,580
Sleep.

519
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,970
Why are you staring at me?

520
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,860
Close your eyes and sleep.

521
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,870
All the lights are on. How can I fall asleep?

522
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,830
Haven't you slept?

523
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,990
I making a plan.

524
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,870
Don't worry about me.

525
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,170
As we're more and more pressed for time, I should make a detailed plan,

526
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,320
so that we can arrange every hour and every day effectively.

527
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,490
Li Xun,

528
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,300
be sure to win.

529
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,320
You must win.

530
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,550
Don't worry.

531
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,340
You paid me, so I'll help you win.

532
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,870
You can ask me to do whatever you want

533
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,520
after the competition.

534
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,840
Write it down.

535
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,950
What?

536
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,380
You said I could ask you to do anything I like.

537
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,940
Words alone are no proof.

538
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,000
Just put it down carefully.

539
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,940
But what you said is ambiguous.

540
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,990
You said it yourself.

541
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,820
"After the competition, Li Xun can ask me to do anything he likes.

542
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,030
Zhu Yun."

543
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,100
What does this mean?

544
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,300
God knows how long

545
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,800
I can get your pay.

546
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,500
I just want this.

547
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,140
♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

548
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,960
♫  And have passed through the dark night  ♫

549
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,060
♫  In the crowd in the dim light  ♫

550
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,620
♫  You're over there with the fireworks  ♫

551
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,200
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

552
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,420
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

553
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,840
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

554
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,830
Li Xun,

555
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,760
what I'll say is serious.

556
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,050
No matter what you want to do

557
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,970
and what goals you want to complete in the future,

558
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,090
you can count me in.

559
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,170
♫  We will not separate  ♫

560
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,150
I'm not kidding.

561
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,900
I'll keep my word.

562
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,280
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

563
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,320
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

564
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,880
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

565
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,390
I know.

566
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,060
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

567
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,620
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

568
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,820
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

569
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,400
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

570
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,860
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

571
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,420
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

572
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,880
♫  That hot firework  ♫

573
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:17,900
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

574
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:29,720


575
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,060
   

576
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,300
 It's an insult to the fairness of the competition 

577
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,810
 that you can win the special prize for this shabby project. 

578
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,950
 It's all cut and dried 

579
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,790
 You're using such unscrupulous means. 

580
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,270
 You should be responsible for your remarks. 

581
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,110
 Student, why are you doing this? 

582
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,040
 Because of love. 

583
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,480
♫  I also want to stand by your side  ♫

584
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,700
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

585
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,300
♫  Every dream that I have  ♫

586
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,880
♫  Will not, will not, will not lose to time anymore  ♫
