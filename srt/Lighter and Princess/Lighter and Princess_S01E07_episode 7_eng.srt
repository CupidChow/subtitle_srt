1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:15,960


2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,000
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,380
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,460
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,240
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,720
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,500
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,980
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,820
   

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,850
After that, I realized something.

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,910
I was too blind to like someone as cold and arrogant as Li Xun.

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,700
From now on, I solemnly declare that I do not like him anymore.

25
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,010
If you like him, you can go after him.

26
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,020
I don't like him.

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,990
Really?

28
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,920
Anyone who likes him is out of their sick in the head.

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,340
Yes, sick in the head.

30
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,630
Are you not going to the base?

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,100
Of course, I'm going.

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,330
I didn't scold him before because I went easy on him.

33
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,510
If he dares scold me again, I'll teach him how to behave.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,270
Please check this again.

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,050
How's the web?

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
Did you make up?

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,920
- None of your business. 
 - None of your business.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,620
I really can't understand the friendship of you girls at all.

39
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,030
I don't think Liu Sisi will ever come again.

40
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,170
Are you really not taking action?

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,890
Whoever likes him is a dog.

42
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,410
How is it? Is the UI okay? 
  (User Interface) 

43
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,830
We added a revolving LED banner here in this place, a video window here to broadcast some promotional videos,

44
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,770
and there is also a pop-up window here to hang some external links to shopping websites.

45
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,090
And this one. We've changed the mouse to look like their logo.

46
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,650
Isn't that quite impressive?

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,590
Isn't it quite gimmicky? Don't you think it is a bit fancy and there are too many widgets?

48
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,670
If you take it to the bidding, it still seems that the design is not mature enough.

49
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,860
I don't think so. All websites are like this now.

50
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,200
If it is too plain, it looks like we didn't put in any effort.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,500
Fine. Just use yours.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,540
Really?

53
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,250
That's it.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,670
I told you it was okay.

55
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,230
One revision is enough.

56
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,580
I don't think we're that good.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,220
You're just not confident.

58
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,230
Li Xun didn't say anything. There must be no problem!

59
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,470
- But... 
 -  Enough.

60
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,120
We're going to have to stand up for ourselves and fight like we did this time.

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,970
We are not here to work for him. We are all a team.

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,450
He also needs to learn to cooperate and listen to us.

63
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,370
If he keeps acting like that, he'll get into trouble sooner or later.

64
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,080
If something goes wrong, there must be a reason unknown behind it.

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,320
I still find it weird.

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,060
You do look weird to me.

67
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,690
Hurry.

68
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,840
Old Gao.

69
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,700
You're pretty decent.

70
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,540
I have to. We can't bring shame on the base.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,970
Besides, I borrowed it from my senior last night.

72
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,060
It took me a long time to learn how to tie a tie from a video this morning.

73
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,270
I almost strangled myself to death.

74
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,140
I also pondered over my dress for a while, too.

75
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,390
Where is Li Xun?

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,650
Oh, he told me this morning that he might not be able to come.

77
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,120
What is he up to?

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,350
Anyway, we're the ones doing the presentation. It doesn't matter if he's there or not.

79
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,210
Are you sure you and I are okay?

80
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,210
Maybe we should just go find him.

81
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,830
Why can't we? We're on the shortlist anyway.

82
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,970
Class rep, you need to have faith in us.

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,260
Let's go.

84
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,710
It'll take more than an hour on the road.

85
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,600
Come in, Your Highness.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,050
Take a break. We've tested it so many times. It can't be faulty.

87
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,740
Don't get carsick later.

88
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,880
The presentation is the most important thing.

89
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,150
Relax, relax.

90
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,810
Don't worry, I've never been carsick since I was a kid.

91
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,810
Are you okay? You threw up like that.

92
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,360
Old Gao, neither of us is experienced at this.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,860
Why don't we call Li Xun?

94
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,110
Why are you so nervous?

95
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,260
It's fine. We can win this bid for sure.

96
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,110
Besides, there's a first time for everything.

97
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,400
Li Xun has never made a bid either.

98
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,590
I need you to hand me that little packet of mouthwash.

99
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,210
How about this?

100
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,320
I'm going to speak later, and you can fill in.

101
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,490
Okay, I'll do as you say.

102
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,020
Hello, we're here for the bidding.

103
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,010
You're here to bid? What's taking you so long?

104
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,380
The others are already here. What company are you from?

105
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,100
We are from the School-Enterprise Cooperation Center of the Computer Science Department at Nanhu University.

106
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,860
Well, we were stuck in traffic.

107
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,300
Okay, you guys sign in first.

108
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,690
   

109
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,550
Isn't your bidder Li Xun?

110
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,090
This time I will be the speaker.

111
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,700
Then you have to sign his name; otherwise, I won't be able to match your number.

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,690
   

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,050
   

114
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,070
Hello, leaders, I am from Demu Tech Co. Ltd.

115
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,310
This time, we chose the parallax design for our web design.

116
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,480
Demu Tech came, too.

117
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,110
Indeed. I didn't think there would be any big companies involved.

118
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,200
It can reflect the youthfulness of our brand,

119
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,310
so as to attract more young customers.

120
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,980
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to make a phone call.

121
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,700
Scroll at different speeds to create a 3D movement.

122
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,900
   

123
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,220
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

124
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,780
   

125
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,050
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,290
So our idea is to highlight a new word.

127
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,250
So our company's design concept is contrary to everyone else.

128
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,440
We only pursue one word; that is earth.

129
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,690
- You called Li Xun, huh? 
 - He turned his cell phone off.

130
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,130
We are here to bid. What is he thinking?

131
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,960
We are supposed to do the presentation today.

132
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,040
So we should design web pages as sparingly as possible.

133
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,340
How about this one?

134
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,680
This one is even better than the last one.

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,970
Their minimalist style looks easy, only when you get started will you know how difficult it is.

136
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,840
Especially that tab.

137
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,610
I've seen the master write it on the design exchange site before.

138
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,320
That may take us half a year to learn it.

139
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,140
For example, one of our creative designs is to change the mouse to look like your company's logo,

140
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,100
so as to impress the customers.

141
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm going to make one more phone call.

142
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,570
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

143
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,840
What is he doing?

144
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,790
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,900
   
   
   
   

146
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,820
What's wrong?

147
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,900
I just accidentally deleted the wrong line of code.

148
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,380
I was going to add a dynamic plug-in to the navigation bar,

149
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,720
so that it could be at least more attractive at first glance.

150
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,090
It's okay. Copy mine. I have a backup on my computer.

151
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,680
I changed the navigation bar when I last put it together.

152
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,990
You don't have it.

153
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,320
The design that best fits the user's habits is good design.

154
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,250
That's it for my presentation. Thank you all.

155
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,680
 The fourth speaker is from the School-Enterprise Cooperation Center of the Computer Science Department at Nanhu University. 

156
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,760
Is Nanhu University here?

157
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,090
Let's go.

158
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,720
The School-Enterprise Cooperation Center of the Computer Science Department at Nanhu University.

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,220
Bidder is Li Xun.

160
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,300
Is Li Xun here?

161
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,710
Yes.

162
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,630
Old Gao.

163
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,660
   

164
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,170
Hello, everyone.

165
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,330
I am Gao Jianhong

166
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,540
from the School-Enterprise Cooperation Center of the Computer Science Department at Nanhu University.

167
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,490
Our website design concept this time is youthfulness and lifestyle.

168
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,920
Youthfulness means that we want to attract more young people

169
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,710
to pat-patronize Blue Crown's website.

170
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:39,000
Lifestyle means that we want to be more in line with the user's habits.

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,550
We also changed the mouse to look like Blue Crown's logo,

172
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,270
- and we... 
 - Hold on.

173
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,080
What's wrong with that navigation bar?

174
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,290
Well, it was originally a dynamic component.

175
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,940
There seems to be something wrong with the code.

176
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,170
Didn't you test it before coming?

177
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,500
We did. We tested it many times.

178
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,640
But I tried to make a change just now,

179
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,080
and it seemed too late.

180
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
Young man,

181
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,450
you're a student,

182
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,140
so we can understand that you're not as accomplished as the rest,

183
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,900
but you can't just come up here with something like that.

184
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,480
We are very serious about this tender.

185
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,450
Do you have any respect for us and for your competitors?

186
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,530
Your bid is well written.

187
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,440
How come your presentation is different

188
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,400
and you came up here with a work in progress?

189
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,320
   

190
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,390
 Why is it different from the bid we submitted? 

191
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,750
This is really a work in progress.

192
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,350
   
   

193
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,820
Sorry.

194
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,460
What we just showed you is the first draft we made.

195
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,650
We had a lot of arguments about what a navigation bar would look like,

196
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,650
but then we realized that consumers don't care about navigation bars at all.

197
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,310
They only care about how to buy products more easily.

198
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,940
The first draft we just showed you was only to prove to you

199
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,600
how scary it can be if you go in the wrong direction.

200
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,240
So in the second draft, we completely left the website design concept behind

201
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,040
and focused more on how to make it easier

202
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,850
and faster for users to buy your products.

203
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,490
Blue Crown's main business is snacks and health products,

204
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,180
but these are not necessities for most consumers.

205
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,750
We have analyzed the consumption behaviors on major shopping websites

206
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,820
and conducted a questionnaire survey.

207
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,210
It's found that the purchase of such products is usually completed on impulse.

208
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,010
So we need to make the process from selection to payment as short as possible,

209
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,600
without any hindrance or hassle for the consumers.

210
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,810
In the purchase process on a traditional shopping site,

211
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,460
consumers need to register, login,

212
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,810
fill in the address, bind your bank card,

213
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,520
and enter the password to pay.

214
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,790
But these five steps are too complicated and cumbersome

215
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,720
for buying a non-essential item.

216
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,250
Consumers are likely to stop at any step.

217
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,840
So our suggestion is

218
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,980
not to build a new payment system on your own,

219
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,720
but to rely on a mature payment application with universal user information.

220
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,080
I dare to predict that a payment application like that will be a big trend.

221
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,940
Thank you.

222
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,060
 He's been coding all day. 

223
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,680
 When did he study this? 

224
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,200
Old Gao.

225
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,480
What's wrong with you?

226
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,510
Are you mad?

227
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,670
Li Xun went too far.

228
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm sure he wasn't targeting you.

229
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,320
- He had his own plans. 
 - What plans?

230
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,690
Was he planning to tease us,

231
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,340
or was he planning to make me look like a fool on stage and embarrass myself?

232
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,910
Old Gao.

233
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,740
I see. You're a talented young man.

234
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,860
It's normal that you don't want to work for others.

235
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,810
Here is my business card.

236
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,390
If you need any financial and technical support next, feel free to contact me.

237
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,120
Our company would love to support young people with talent and ideas.

238
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,650
I hope we can cooperate.

239
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,350
Thank you.

240
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,310
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you.

241
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,810
Are you convinced?

242
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,940
   

243
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,950
What do you mean?

244
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,310
If you thought we couldn't do it from the beginning and didn't intend to use our program,

245
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,780
why didn't you make it clear?

246
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,470
You made us waste so much time and energy and pull so many all-nighters for nothing!

247
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,600
I made four or five versions of a 40-odd-page bid.

248
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,620
You played me!

249
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,490
Didn't I make it clear?

250
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,570
If you did not go on stage today to see for yourself the difference between you and others,

251
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,170
you would always be so childish and so stubborn.

252
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,720
We are a team.

253
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,680
I treat you like a brother and a comrade.

254
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,490
You left me out on stage today to teach me a lesson and let everyone laugh at me.

255
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,580
What do you take me for?

256
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,800
Li Xun, if there was anything you wanted to tell us, just tell us.  We can change it.

257
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,620
Is the website we made really that bad?

258
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,720
What do you think?

259
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,140
If I hadn't changed the bid, you wouldn't even have had a chance of being shortlisted.

260
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,240
You're right.

261
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,220
We are a team.

262
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,820
So all you have to do is listen to me and follow me.

263
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,470
I will lead you to success.

264
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,050
 Pass the ball. Pass the ball. 

265
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,090
 This way. Pass it. 

266
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,710
 - Again. Again. 
 -Yes. Yes. 

267
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,280
 Surround him! 

268
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,050
 - Come again. 
 - I'll keep an eye on him. 

269
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,800
 Keep an eye on him. 

270
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,000
 Bring it on! 

271
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,490
 Who do you think you are? 

272
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,090
 Stop him! 

273
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,990
Okay, okay. I quit, I quit, I quit.

274
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,530
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

275
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,150
 Go. Go. 

276
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,640
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

277
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,030
I'm going. Let's play another time.

278
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,440
- I'm not playing. Bye. 
 - Bye.

279
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,880
You were aggressive.

280
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,700
Thanks.

281
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,760
Did Li Xun ask you to come?

282
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,730
Yeah, how could he let you come?

283
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,870
He doesn't care about anyone.

284
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,650
You know what kind of person he is.

285
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,480
It's not your first day knowing him.

286
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,360
But if it wasn't for Li Xun,

287
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,970
we would have been even more humiliated this time.

288
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,250
Zhu Yun, you changed your mind pretty quick.

289
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,350
Did you become his fan?

290
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,400
I'm just being realistic.

291
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,150
Li Xun did nothing wrong.

292
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,840
He just did it his way.

293
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,290
Out of Blue Crown, no one knows who we are.

294
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,760
Let me say something.

295
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,050
We won the bid for Blue Crown's project.

296
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,940
What do you mean? Did we apprehend and take them down?

297
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,760
Really?

298
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,800
 We won the bid in our first year. 

299
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,700
It's great that we can win such a big project in our first year.

300
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,300
I'll treat you to milk tea in the afternoon.

301
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,080
Next, our base will focus on this project.

302
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,060
Most of you will follow me to code,

303
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,270
and the rest will be responsible for looking up the information and building the database.

304
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,320
I will assign some tasks to each of you.

305
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,000
Although most of the proceeds from this project will end up going to the school,

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
you will all get paid.

307
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
We can even make money.

308
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Sure, and we get extra marks when we finish the project.

309
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,300
When our class is awarded as an outstanding class,

310
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,100
we can get a 3,000 yuan bonus.

311
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,300
Great!

312
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,800
Old Gao, you guys did a great job.

313
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Old Gao, you're promising. Thanks to the three of you.

314
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,900
Old Gao, you have to buy us dinner.

315
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,600
 Yes. 

316
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,100
Why don't you tell them?

317
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,000
Tell them that I had nothing to do with the winning bid.

318
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,700
That day you went on stage and hit me in the face,

319
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,600
but today you save my face.

320
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,000
Li Xun, do you think you're quite great?

321
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,880
It's just a project.

322
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,800
Do you have to do that?

323
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,300
I came to the base to do the project properly.

324
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,200
I don't want to be fooled around.

325
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,700
Old Gao.

326
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,100
Okay.

327
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,000
Time is tight and the task is heavy.

328
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's get to work!

329
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,000
I quit.

330
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
- Old Gao.
 - Old Gao. Old Gao.

331
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,800
Wu Mengxing. Fang Shumiao.

332
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,100
You are responsible for collecting some online reviews about Blue Crown's food and health products.

333
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I'll take both good and bad reviews.

334
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,950
What's wrong now?

335
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,520
Can't you stop hurting people with your words?

336
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,870
Li Xun.

337
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,460
When I was young, I especially liked to play with fire on the gas stove,

338
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,850
and always played with it when my mom and sister were not around.

339
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,270
My mom always scolded me, but I just didn't listen,

340
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,120
until one time...

341
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,980
Then I learned my lesson and never played again.

342
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,050
You can tell me fables here.

343
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,930
Why can't you say something nice to Gao?

344
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,390
I have no obligation to coax you.

345
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,420
What do you take us for?

346
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,120
Do I treat you guys badly?

347
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,080
You should persuade Old Gao not to quit, okay?

348
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,690
Old Gao can distinguish between right and wrong.

349
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,170
Do not worry, he is not as delicate as you.

350
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,940
 Let me have a look. Let me have a look. 

351
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,010
 Nothing. Let me have a look. 

352
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,490
 Return it to me. 

353
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,320
What do you want from me?

354
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,010
Gao Jianhong,

355
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,820
do you want to make something...

356
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,760
that is really your own?

357
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,660
 How's it going? Are you having a good time without me? 

358
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,320
Old Gao, you're back.

359
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,480
 We really need you so much. 

360
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,840
 - You're not here...  
 - Really?

361
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,620
Old Gao, here you are.

362
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,150
- Yeah. 
 -  Morning.

363
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,670
Morning.

364
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,800
Did you make up?

365
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,470
None of your business.

366
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,350
That's quite a bromance.

367
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,240
What did he say to you?

368
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,970
Couldn't I have figured it out and come back on my own?

369
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,190
Li Xun is right.

370
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,340
I'll be stronger with him.

371
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,590
- Go. 
 - Old Gao.

372
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,590
- Morning. 
 -  Morning.

373
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,180
Slow down. Slow down.

374
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,960
Have you checked them?

375
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,290
Yes. Rest assured.

376
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,550
 - Cookies. 
 -  Cookies. 

377
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,370
 Here. Here. Here. 

378
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,450
This one should be eaten after a meal. This one can be chewed directly.

379
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,460
Come here.

380
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,420
Where are we going?

381
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,990
I'm done with the search bar. Just give me a day off.

382
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,850
I haven't agreed yet.

383
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,380
I haven't been back since yesterday.

384
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,200
I went back three days out of seven last week, and all in the latter part of the night.

385
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,960
Look! I have pimples on my chin.

386
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,560
And I'm so hungry now.

387
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,600
I have enough snacks and health products.

388
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,630
I stink.

389
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,040
I don't smell anything.

390
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,930
Why have you learned to behave like a capitalist before you become a boss?

391
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,190
I don't care. I have to go back today.

392
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,900
You have half an hour to shower and change before getting back to work.

393
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,530
It takes me ten minutes to walk back.

394
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,110
On my bike.

395
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,950
29 minutes to go.

396
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,820
Can you slow down a little bit?

397
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,740
Aren't you in a hurry?

398
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,600
♫  Slowly missing you during the long night  ♫

399
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,080
♫  A moment of a fast beating heart  ♫

400
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,540
♫  As long as you're by my side  ♫

401
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,700
♫  I forget time unconsciously  ♫

402
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,780
♫  Slowly understanding you on the long road  ♫

403
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,240
♫  Without you, even joy feels lonely  ♫

404
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,640
♫  Looking at your white shirt  ♫

405
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,820
♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

406
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,760
♫  The secret I've been hiding  ♫

407
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,160
♫  I really want to be with you  ♫

408
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,360
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

409
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,500
♫  The knight and princess are destined to meet  ♫

410
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,400
♫  Let me feel and guard your simple wis  ♫

411
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,700
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days, 
 I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

412
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,500
♫  By my side or on my pillow, you say every good night  ♫

413
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,720
♫  Happiness has never changed  ♫

414
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,400
In the last few days, many students have come to me for help and asked me questions.

415
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,880
I understand very well.

416
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,250
Our course has just entered the practical stage,

417
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,520
- and it is normal that you will encounter... 
  - Where is he? 

418
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,220
...some confusion.

419
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,240
But I want to tell you.

420
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,420
Don't think of the C language as too complicated.

421
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,980
I'll talk to Mr. Lin.

422
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,340
Okay.

423
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,280
Mr. Lin, here comes Zhang Xiaobei.

424
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,350
- Where? 
 - There.

425
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,370
- Wait a minute. 
 - Okay.

426
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,420
Share these copies with your classmates later.

427
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,030
The woman who just came to Old Lin is called Zhang Xiaobei.

428
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,880
She was previously engaged in automation.

429
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,340
I wonder whose coattails she's on.

430
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,410
She has now joined Xinchuang as a project director.

431
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,600
The Enterprise Cooperation Center for our school's graduate program cooperates with Xinchuang, right?

432
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,470
She's in charge of it.

433
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,700
What is she doing here?

434
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,120
Do you know how much money we can get for our project?

435
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,810
How much?

436
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,130
600,000 yuan.

437
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,350
That much?

438
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,000
Old Gao, I have a bad feeling about this.

439
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,480
I think Zhang Xiaobei is here for our project.

440
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,320
No need to doubt. She is here for that project.

441
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,110
I'm starving.

442
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,620
Add some pepper.

443
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,530
Don't forget to eat.

444
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,020
Old Gao, the day we went to bid, we saw a tall, thin boy.

445
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,810
Do you remember?

446
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,860
I just remembered now.

447
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,780
He's Han Jiakang from the Enterprise Cooperation Center of our school's graduate program.

448
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,220
So he works for Zhang Xiaobei, doesn't he?

449
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,780
It doesn't seem like a coincidence that we went to bid

450
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,690
and met our own school's competitor, does it?

451
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,160
It's weird.

452
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,930
I can't help but think it's weird.

453
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,050
Unless they've been planning to take away the project for a long time.

454
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,270
You are responsible for the green part.

455
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,360
Time must be strictly controlled.

456
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,990
Li Xun, someone wants to take away Blue Crown's project.

457
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,410
Is Gao Jianhong here?

458
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,840
Here I am.

459
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,090
What's going on? Shall we have a meeting?

460
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,570
Just a minute.

461
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,080
   

462
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,410
You're all here!

463
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,500
Miss Zhang.

464
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,950
I'll start with a brief introduction.

465
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,240
This is Zhang Xiaobei.

466
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,380
Miss Zhang is the project manager of Xinchuang.

467
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,920
Xinchuang also set up an Enterprise Cooperation Center for our school's graduate program.

468
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,630
These are your seniors.

469
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,190
Han Jiakang, Zhou Jinyang, Yu Feng, and Lin Jiajia.

470
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,470
Today, I've called both sides together

471
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,730
because I want to tell you something.

472
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,250
Didn't our base win a software outsourcing project?

473
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:25,600
Coincidentally, Xiaobei and Jiakang's cooperation center also applied for this project.

474
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,820
You two collided.

475
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,840
What should we do?

476
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,990
I think you both can have a win-win co-operation.

477
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:41,850
It's a good opportunity for you to learn from your seniors.

478
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,940
As for the name, I think we should use Xiaobei's name.

479
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,710
After all, the graduate labs are more professional.

480
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,260
So he is your favorite student. Right?

481
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,140
I've heard about him for a long time.

482
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,420
Your student is extraordinary at first glance.

483
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,270
Don't flatter me.

484
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,620
I'm afraid of what he makes.

485
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,450
If you have any problems in the future, you can call Zhu Yun, my class rep.

486
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,140
She's reliable.

487
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,300
Xiaobei, I have class in the afternoon.

488
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,280
I have to go. It's better if all of you communicate.

489
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,400
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lin.

490
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,270
Goodbye.

491
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,950
Goodbye, sir. Bye.

492
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,800
Although you are both undergraduates, Mr. Lin and Mr. Zhang told me that you are all excellent.

493
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:43,730
This time is just right, and he also wants to use a real opportunity to practice exercises for yourselves.

494
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,940
If you have any problems or questions, please feel free to ask me.

495
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,320
Of course, you can also contact your senior.

496
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,440
Okay.

497
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,810
Why don't we just leave it at that?

498
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,250
Han Jiakang, I need you to stay and talk with them. Okay?

499
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,060
You guys can get back to work.

500
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,350
Zhu Yun, keep your senior's number.

501
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:18,060
- 138... 
 - Senior, when did you sign up?

502
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,060
You weren't among the companies that applied before, were you?

503
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,020
Had I known that graduate students would lead the team, we would not have worked so hard.

504
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,350
How hard it was for us to pull so many all-nighters.

505
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,460
Although we didn't go on stage on the day of the presentation, we actually prepared the materials.

506
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:40,000
What Miss Zhang means is that we should not consume and waste resources internally.

507
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,260
Yeah, that's all we got.

508
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,710
Zhu Yun, this cooperation was agreed by the school.

509
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,920
You should cooperate.

510
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,340
But it's our stuff.

511
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,280
From start to finish, we wrote all the codes.

512
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,030
But we were never asked if we agreed.

513
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,680
I told you we were working for nothing.

514
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,890
The reliable class rep has finished listening to instructions.

515
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,510
Come out for a moment.

516
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
Get to work.

517
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,640
And you just said yes?

518
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,410
Didn't Mr. Lin just say it?

519
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,350
Win-win cooperation.

520
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,790
So what's next?

521
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,940
I sent you the schedule.

522
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,680
Just follow it.

523
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,610
Why don't you stop acting like you don't care?

524
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,920
Do you really want to say yes?

525
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,030
So what do you want me to do,

526
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,070
and what can you do?

527
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,690
Are you willing to do that?

528
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,450
What does it mean?

529
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,680
Mr. Lin is dedicated to academic research and never thinks about dishonest practices.

530
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,360
But even if he doesn't know, you should know what Zhang Xiaobei is here for.

531
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,400
If we work in her name, then we are working for nothing.

532
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,220
I grew up seeing a lot of people like her who relied on big companies to exploit students for cheap labor.

533
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,000
We can't just say yes.

534
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
There must be another way.

535
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:51,580
Besides, even without her, we can finish the website based on our strengths.

536
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,930
Your Highness, you are full of confidence!

537
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,570
Aren't you mad at all?

538
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,740
Why should I be mad?

539
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,860
You usually look down on this and that.

540
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,740
Why don't you dare to fight when you meet a tougher guy?

541
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,550
Is it useful to be mad?

542
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,800
Who gave the most to this project?

543
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,640
Who stayed up late every night?

544
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,480
Who did the planning?

545
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,900
Who built the framework?

546
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,360
How can you not be mad at all and make such a joke?

547
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,740
Do you feel sorry for me?

548
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,460
I'm talking to you seriously.

549
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,620
Our whole base has been working on this project for so long.

550
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,490
Even if you're not mad at it for yourself, you should be mad at it for us.

551
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,070
Your Highness,

552
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,330
you really are too well protected.

553
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:07,420
There are a lot of things people like you will never understand.

554
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,200
Don't say something grandiose but impractical to me like you've been here before.

555
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,080
Zhu Yun, have you ever seen a bad person?

556
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,330
What do you mean?

557
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,630
Zhang Xiaobei is nothing.

558
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,200
There are many people who are much worse than Zhang Xiaobei.

559
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,110
There are always people in this society who will push you to your limits.

560
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,400
As I said, there are some things you will never understand.

561
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,080
If I had to hold a grudge...

562
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,370
for every single thing I've experienced,

563
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:49,170
I'd only be doing revenge for the rest of my life.

564
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,420
Don't you care at all?

565
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,390
I don't have time to care.

566
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,940
Kill one thousand enemies and self-damage eight hundred.

567
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,510
She's not worth my self-destruction.

568
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:20,920
Li Xun, is anyone worth it to you?

569
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,950
I thought you saw us as friends.

570
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,220
Your Highness,

571
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,770
you really think highly of yourself.

572
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,980
The company Zhang Xiaobei works for has a partnership with the school.

573
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:57,830
She has a reason for the school-enterprise cooperation, so it's useless for us to fight hard.

574
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,970
Go back to work. It has been delayed for a day.

575
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,420
Li Xun.

576
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,580
The base is yours.

577
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,040
Blue Crown's project is also yours.

578
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,080
You have the right to give it away,

579
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,430
I also have the right to quit.

580
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:47,030


581
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,680
   

582
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,930
 Who does Zhang Xiaobei think she is? She came here to show off her authority. 

583
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,270
 Then, why should we give up? 

584
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,680
 Li Xun, you'll find a way out. Right? 

585
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,800
 Blue Crown's website is out of date. 

586
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,200
 When Zhang Xiaobei finds out that she has been fooled by me, she will never let me go easily.
