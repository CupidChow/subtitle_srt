00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,216
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,700
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,700
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

♫  The knight and the king  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,400
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11

14
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15

♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,800
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

21
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,800
   

22
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Your eyelashes are really long.

23
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,000
- Are, are you all right? 
 - It hurts.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
Where? Where?

25
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,800
- Here? 
 - My waist.

26
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
- Here? 
 - Don't touch me.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
I won't touch you.

28
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Then let me help you stand up.

29
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,200
- Wait. Wait. 
 - Come on.

30
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't move me.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Slowly.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
What did you have for breakfast?

33
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
Steamed stuffed buns.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Why didn't you bring me some?

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,500
The door is open.

36
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
 - Drag it down. 
 - Don't move me. Don't move me. 

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
 Let me help you stand up. 

38
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
 Leave me alone first. 

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
 - I can stand up myself. 
 - Okay, okay, try yourself. 

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can you do it yourself?

41
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,000
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

42
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,000
Go on.

43
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
Help me.

44
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,700
Did you sleep here last night?

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,400
Don't fill your head with nonsense.

46
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I had to stay here for some special reasons yesterday.

47
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,700
So you slept here.

48
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,600
It's not what you think. We just passed the night together.

49
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,400
They slept here.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,600
I also want to sleep here.

51
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,300
Sleep yourself.

52
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,300
Why don't you explain to them?

53
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,400
They're right.

54
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,700
We did sleep here.

55
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,100
♫  Slowly missing you during the long night  ♫

56
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,600
♫  A moment of a fast beating heart  ♫

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
♫  As long as you're by my side  ♫

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000

♫  Looking at your white shirt  ♫

62

♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

63
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,800
♫  The secret I've been hiding  ♫

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
 I still have your shirt. 

65
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,800
 When can I give it back to you? 

66
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,330
 Otherwise, don't worry. I'll wash it and return it to you.

Hello, sir.

83
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,800
Okay, I'll be right at the door.

84
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,600
   
 Quickly. Quickly. Here. 

85
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,200
   
 Quickly. 

86
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 Be careful not to hurt others. 

87
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
 - Come on. Be careful. 
 - Here. 

88
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,700
 Let me tell you. 

89
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,200
 Here. Yes. Move it to the platform. 

90
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
 This way. Yes. Good 

91
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,900
 Follow this line. Just put it here. 

92
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Sir, this poster was just put here. Why are you moving it away?

93
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,200
I don't know. Our superior asked us to move it away.

94
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,500
We have to obey orders.

95
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,900
Could-Could you keep away from here? I'm afraid they may hurt you.

96
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,000
 Move the small poster away, too. 

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
 Come on. 

98
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
 Lift it. 

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Be careful. 

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,400
   
 Put it down properly, put it down properly. 

101
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
   
 Come on. 

102
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,700
 Make it straight. 

103
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
 Give it to me. 

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,400
 Move it inside first. 

105
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,800
   

106
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,700
Zhu Yun.

107
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,600
It's really you.

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,200
What's up?

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,500
Well, have you played our game "Rivalry Among Seven Powers"?

110
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,000
"Rivalry Among Seven Powers"?

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,500
If you didn't tell me it, I thought it was our game "Invincible General".

112
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,500
Any developers can work out games of the same type,

113
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,400
but whether they can succeed all depends on luck.

114
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, does your game still sell well?

115
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Do you know how much we have invested in the publicity of this game?

116
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Do you know how many marketing KOLs we have?

117
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Do you and Li Xun still naively think that it's the same as it was in university

118
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,330
and you can stand out only by your competency?

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,800
Do you know the biggest difference between the two games?

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,700
Your game is only designed to meet the needs of a small number of players.

121
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,150
Once you lose them, your game will have no value.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
But we can make money with our game.

123
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,000
If we spend a little bit of time,

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,800
we can overwhelm you.

125
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,100
We can thoroughly defeat you.

126
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,900
I know you must think I'm a mean and shameless man.

127
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Many people think so.

128
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,200
They think we L &amp; P  like to resort to plagiarism and hype

129
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
and have no bottom line.

130
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,700
We don't care.

131
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,900
Anyhow, people in this world only stress the results.

132
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,000
They just worship the strong.

133
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,100
Zhu Yun,

134
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,900
do you think this scene is very familiar?

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,940
   

136
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Have you finished?

137
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll leave.

138
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,300
Your car has run more than 50,000 kilometers in half a year.

139
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
It's a little too much.

140
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,900
What are they doing?

141
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,400
He's checking the air intake of the car.

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 - Does Mr. Dong want to sell his car?

143
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
 And this one. 

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,500
Maybe.

145
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,000
50,000 yuan less than the price we mentioned.

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,200
Well, you're such a profiteer.

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,300
The car cover cost me 48,000 yuan.

148
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Why does he sell his car?

149
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Why, indeed?

150
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,700
Our company is having economic difficulties. He wants to subsidize the company.

151
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,000
Our company is having such difficulties?

152
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,400
What do you think?

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,000
Cherish your working days now.

154
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,800
It is estimated that our company will go bankrupt soon.

155
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,700
 - Rivalry Among Seven Powers."  
  - L &amp; P is hyping this game regardless of the cost.

156
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,900
Whenever I open a website, I can see this internet-famous face.

157
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,000
They really want to eliminate us.

158
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
I played it carefully.

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Their game has exactly the same content as ours,

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,400
but their system is not as ingenious as ours.

161
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,200
Yes.

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,700
But I don't think...

163
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,800
L &amp; P wanted to make its game "Rivalry Among Seven Powers" go far.

164
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,400
They just wanted to earn as much as they could by launching a new game.

165
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
They often do such mean things.

166
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
Practice makes perfect. And they can also eliminate us at the same time.

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,600
The key is that their games have a strong linkage.

168
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,400
L &amp; P is one of the top Chinese game companies in the number of players.

169
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
So they have universal coins.

170
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,100
Players can use their coins in other games besides "Rivalry Among Seven Powers".

171
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,200
We have no such advantage.

172
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,500
We can't compete with them at this point at all.

173
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,500
I don't think...

174
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,700
our company can overcome this difficulty this time.

175
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,100
Look!  Those three didn't come to work.

176
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,600
Zhang Fang really has something to drink.

177
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,300
There are two cans of beer. Each of us can have one.

178
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,400
Here you are.

179
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,700
Zhao Teng, the Dark Iron Divine Sword has low-quality patches and codes.

180
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,900
You'd better improve them again.

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
Well, group leader.

182
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
In fact, I've known you were not an ordinary girl

183
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
since the first day you came here.

184
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,500
So although I'm a few years older than you,

185
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,200
I always call you group leader.

186
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
It's because I admire you.

187
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,100
It can't be helped.

188
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,000
So it's unnecessary to improve those patches and solve those bugs.

189
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,200
Well, pretty little sister, let's face it.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
Come on. Cheers.

191
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,400
To ourselves.

192
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,300
"Invincible General" wasn't that popular.

193
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,100
You've created a miracle by making it sort of popular among the players.

194
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,400
So I think we've really done our best.

195
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
We have a clear conscience.

196
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,100
But anyway, we should guarantee the update the day after tomorrow.

197
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm going to find Li Xun.

198
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
Do you usually play games?

199
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
- Yes, I play games. 
 - I seldom play games.

200
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
- What games do you play? 
 - I don't play games.

201
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
 - Yes. I seldom play them. 
 - There has been a very popular game recently. 

202
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
 I didn't hear of it. 

203
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,700
 It's about animation. 

204
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,300
 - Many game developers like watching animations. 
 - But I think it's actually a fun game. 

205
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,400
- Is it? 
 - Yes.

206
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,200
The design in the game is full of animation color. That's pretty good.

207
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
What's the game mainly about?

208
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,000
It's about the adventures of an animated character and...

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Really?

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Your friend?

211
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,300
Okay, you may talk first.

212
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,100
- Let's talk next time. 
 - See you next time.

213
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Bye-bye.

214
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,400
Dong Siyang sold his car.

215
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Our company will become bankrupt. What are you doing here?

216
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,400
The websites are full of publicity ads for "Rivalry Among Seven Powers."

217
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
What can I do?

218
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,500
What should we do now?

219
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,300
We can't change the direction of a flying bullet.

220
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,600
Just let it be.

221
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
What do you mean by it?

222
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,700
We have no money to invest in ads.

223
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
Anyhow, we can't resist the internet ghostwriters L &amp; P hired.

224
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
We'd better stop our losses in time.

225
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
Can we just sit watching?

226
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Of course not.

227
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,200
You and Zhao Teng continue to improve the game to ensure the normal update the day after tomorrow.

228
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,300
And what about you?

229
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,400
Keep drinking coffee here?

230
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,200
This is my personal privacy, Group Leader Zhu.

231
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Anything else?

232
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,700
Didn't you wash it for me?

233
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Since you're so free, wash it yourself.

234
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,600
What are you doing? Our company hasn't closed down.

235
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
What are you doing?

236
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,900
What are you doing?

237
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,710
Don't move the company items.

238
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
No, Mr. Dong. You know us well.

239
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,900
We aren't money lovers.

240
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,400
Our company is going to close.

241
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,800
Everyone can find something to cash in as severance pay.

242
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
It's fate that brought us together.

243
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,600
At last, we have to carry this through to the end.

244
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,700
What severance pay?

245
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,900
What "carrying this through to the end"?

246
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,000
What are you talking about?

247
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,400
Our company won't close.

248
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,300
And we'll begin to do something bigger.

249
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,900
Open it.

250
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,910
Where did you get so much money?

251
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,600
Where's Li Xun?

252
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Get him back.

253
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,700
I see, Mr. Dong.

254
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,300
You'll receive a bigger project.

255
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,000
Tell us what we should first do.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,100
Go for team building.

257
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,700
If we don't pick up an order, we'll go for team building today.

258
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
It's in the suburbs.

259
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,700
Will Mr. Dong take us to go camping?

260
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,520
If we go camping in such weather, we will suffer.

261
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
This is our first team building activity.

262
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,100
What a rare chance. Don't be so picky.

263
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,700
It's strange to hold a team building activity now.

264
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,200
You know what, we should rally our morale at this critical moment.

265
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Yes.

266
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Zhang Fang should be criticized.

267
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,500
As the HR Director, he first said we would be dismissed

268
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,200
and shook our morale.

269
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
It's-It's my management strategy. Do you know?

270
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
By this way, I can find out who will leave first.

271
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Well, it's simply entrapment.

272
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,900
Anyway, I'll live and die together with our company.

273
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,800
Right, Mr. Dong?

274
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,600
Li-Li Xun didn't sleep last night.

275
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,200
He didn't sleep in the coffee shop the whole night.

276
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
No, he worked overtime in the company.

277
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,100
How long will it take to arrive at the destination?

278
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,600
Soon.

279
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,900
Where are we going?

280
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,200
You'll know when we get there.

281
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,300
Hello, Mr. Dong.

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Welcome. Mr. Dong, the rooms you booked are ready.

283
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,300
Please tell me if you have any needs. I'll go to work first.

284
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,000
- Okay, go ahead. 
 - Okay.

285
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,700
Well, let's stay here tonight.

286
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Don't think to work today.

287
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Just enjoy your hot baths. Don't waste my money.

288
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
It's expensive.

289
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
Each of you has a room.

290
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,800
You should have told us we would stay here tonight. I didn't bring anything.

291
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,000
What do you want to bring?

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,700
There're wash supplies in the hotel.

293
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,000
Haven't you stayed in any hotels?

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,900
She's a girl.

295
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,200
Do you mean cosmetics?

296
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,400
You're such a pretty girl, so you don't need any cosmetics.

297
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, let's not go back to our rooms now. Let's go for a meal first.

298
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,100
Let's go for a meal.

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,900
We're here for team building today.

300
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,000
Let me say something.

301
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,500
Our company will win for sure. Cheers.

302
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
Good.

303
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, don't forget me.

304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,100
Just have one drink.

305
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,400
Can you drink?

306
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,600
She can't drink.

307
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,600
If so, don't try to drink with us. Have a soda.

308
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,300
Come on.

309
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,900
Nice! A heroine.

310
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,200
Awesome, awesome.

311
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,200
I see.

312
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,000
She's waiting for Li Xun to save her.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,400
Come on. Pour wine for me.

314
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Well, let's have another drink.

315
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
No, I can't drink anymore.

316
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
He can't drink. I'll drink with you, Mr. Dong.

317
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,400
Um... Good, good, good.

318
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,100
- Come on. 
 - Come on. Drink.

319
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,400
Let me tell you. Some girls can drink a lot.

320
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,100
Well.

321
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,900
Awesome.

322
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,500
Some girls can drink more than us.

323
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,400
They can drink a lot.

324
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,620
Whoever faces the fish head must drink three cups.

325
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,600
Come on, pour it for me.

326
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,254
Er... Mr. Dong, I respect you...

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,200
You don't have to toast me...

328
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,700
Mr. Dong,

329
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,300
is this the first company you've established?

330
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,900
My third uncle brought me up.

331
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,000
He was a worker in a machinery factory.

332
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,600
They made the first wheeled tractor in China.

333
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,200
They were indeed admired by people back then.

334
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,100
My third uncle told me that after I retire from the wrestling team,

335
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,200
he would let me work in the factory as a worker.

336
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,300
I thought about it.

337
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,600
The plan didn't change quickly.

338
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,000
I hadn't retired yet, but the machinery factory went bankrupt and closed.

339
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,500
Then I became a taxi driver.

340
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,800
Later, I was put into prison for some years as I helped my friend in a fight.

341
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,200
After I was released, I didn't want to drive the taxi again.

342
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,700
I thought about what I could do.

343
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,400
I walked on the street one day.

344
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,200
I remember it was in the summer.

345
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
The land was roasting under the sun.

346
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,900
I felt so hot.

347
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
When passing by the gate of an IT company,

348
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,700
I, 10 meters away, was greeted with a gust of cool air

349
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,400
coming out of the opened electric glass door.

350
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
It cooled me off suddenly.

351
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,600
So I began to rest at the door.

352
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Guess what happened then.

353
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,600
A security guard came and drove me away.

354
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,800
It was at that moment that I knew what I should do.

355
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,200
I wanted to open an IT company,

356
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,410
so no one could drive me away when I stayed in the air-conditioned room.

357
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,400
Come on.

358
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
To what you said.

359
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,600
Come on. Cheers.

360
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,500
Cheers. Cheers.

361
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
To tell you the truth,

362
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,700
I've-I've been in this line for less than 10 years.

363
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,400
I actually want to develop some good games.

364
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Well, I've served in four or five companies.

365
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm eager to develop good games.

366
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,000
- I thought "Invincible General"could... 
 - "Invincible General".

367
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,300
Yes, yes. "Invincible General".

368
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,600
I thought it could make a hit.

369
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
It's a pity...

370
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,900
I feel so aggrieved.

371
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,300
It's hard for us to make some money with such a small game.

372
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,500
For them to come out with the same thing...

373
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,800
Why do you think the L &amp; P keeps holding us back?

374
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,100
Enjoy yourselves. I'll go back first.

375
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,800
Mr. Dong is still here.

376
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,900
Stay a bit longer.

377
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,400
He's afraid.

378
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
He can't drink anymore. He can't drink much.

379
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,200
- Still a green hand. 
 - He's a nice guy.

380
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
Let us drink.

381
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,852
It's because of us.

382
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,190
Because Li Xun and I have personal grudge with that company.

383
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,720
Which company?

384
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,110
L &amp; P Company.

385
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,070
One of the bosses of L &amp; P Company is our university classmate.

386
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,130
We started L &amp; P Company together back then.

387
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,510
Li Xun was the leader at that time.

388
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,994
But something happened to him when the company was just established.

389
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:41,590
You all know he was once put into prison.

390
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:46,360
He was put into prison because he hit and blinded the other boss.

391
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,044
You all wonder why I came here.

392
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,468
After Li Xun was released, he chose to work here for some reason.

393
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:02,950
I've always supported his decision.

394
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,978
That's all.

395
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,690
Wait. Wait a moment. Wait a moment.

396
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,602
It-It confuses me.

397
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:17,150
Li Xun hit and blinded the other boss.

398
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,894
Why-Why did he hit him?

399
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,200
It involves his privacy, so I can't tell you about it.

400
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,820
You can think it's because of hatred.

401
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,068
Do you mean Li Xun took the lead in the establishment of L &amp; P?

402
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:33,660
Yes.

403
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,720
I've sensed that for a long time.

404
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,730
I've long thought there must be something wrong.

405
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:46,802
I thought he must have something hidden.

406
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,014
I told you this to rebuild your courage.

407
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:56,700
L &amp; P Company may discredit or suppress us, causing us to lose a project.

408
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,500
We can find another project.

409
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,880
We won't give up until we succeed.

410
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,742
So we've kept fighting against the strong L &amp; P Company.

411
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,140
Just fight against them.

412
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,398
This is our only way out.

413
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:24,291
We are a team now, so we should live or die together.

414
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:28,382
- Yes. 
 - If they weren't in our company...

415
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:30,640
Mr. Dong, please pardon my saying so.

416
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,900
...we can survive for another year or two at most, right?

417
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,100
We know it well.

418
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,729
There's no other good choice for us, right?

419
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:41,301
Yes. We don't blame you.

420
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,300
- It sounds pleasant. 
 - Yes.

421
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Just fight against them. Don't be afraid of them.

422
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,350
Right?

423
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:52,862
We should unite to fight against the rubbish L &amp; P.

424
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,400
Fight against them. Fuck them.

425
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,100
Yes. Fuck them.

426
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,820
Mr. Dong, I'm sorry for hiding all of this from you.

427
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,400
We thought they wouldn't target us within at least one year.

428
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,680
Unexpectedly, they acted so fast.

429
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,384
Do you think I can't find out your stories?

430
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,064
When did you know?

431
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:31,230
Since Li Xun entered my company.

432
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,110
Did he talk with you?

433
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,290
It's obvious.

434
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,128
Did you think I'd let a guy who just got out of jail for a few years

435
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:47,220
and can't even produce a resume to come into my company?

436
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,428
What did he tell you?

437
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,708
Do you want to know his description of you or himself?

438
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,960
Uh? Dong Siyang gave me this room card.

439
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,740
I didn't go wrong.

440
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,412
Yes.

441
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:45,110
There are two rooms. There is another room inside.

442
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,860
You can choose which one you want to stay in.

443
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,060
Where are you going?

444
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,670
Or I'll book another room.

445
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,490
Suit yourself.

446
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,480
Did you tell our past to Dong Siyang?

447
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,510
He's such a sensible person that he could guess it.

448
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,370
I didn't need to tell him.

449
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,204
 He has kept this photo. 

450
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,278
 He told me you were thoughtful 

451
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,549
 but sometimes naive and silly. 

452
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,610
 And you're absolutely capable, 

453
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,710
 loyal, and persistent. 

454
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,510
 You don't have to tell us about the two of you, we can see it clearly. 

455
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:53,690
 - You're still pretending not to care about each other. 
 - Yes. 

456
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:58,750
 Life and love are like games. 

457
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,610
 Both of them are intertwined with various dangers and intimacy and hatred. 

458
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,800
 That's why all of us are addicted to them. Right? 

459
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,502
 Why don't you just express your love to each other? 

460
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,060
Don't stare at me.

461
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,168
Aren't you cold?

462
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,120
Yes, I'm.

463
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,730
Come down.

464
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,250
Why did you drink for me?

465
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,710
Pretentious.

466
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,810
But when Dong Siyang asked you to drink, you refused.

467
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,152
If I got drunk,

468
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,076
could you still leave?

469
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:54,350
If you don't go, I won't go.

470
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,740
Why do you keep my photo?

471
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,940
You glued it back together.

472
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,730
- It belongs to me. 
 - Why is it yours?

473
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,041
- Or is it yours? 
 - Of course.

474
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,410
Okay.

475
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,390
Take it away after going back.

476
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,332
Silly girl.

477
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,300
Seeing you like this reminds me.

478
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,732
I went to look for my homework from you at the university.

479
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:46,460
You're lying on that broken deck chair on that rooftop.

480
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,750
When you looked up at me,

481
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,952
you also wore such a look.

482
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,210
Li Xun,

483
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,480
have you ever thought about me?

484
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,040
What if I say no?

485
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,604
I don't believe you.

486
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,044
I won't believe it.

487
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,612
Is it impossible for us?

488
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,590
You've devoted yourself to the development of the company.

489
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,610
If you don't mention it, I won't mention it.

490
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:10,270
Are we mutually agreeing to disregard our past?

491
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,380
I told you before.

492
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,164
We can't...

493
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,876
We can't act so honestly;

494
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:00,016
otherwise, we'll suffer.

495
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,430
It's all old stuff...

496
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,980
I've long since forgotten.

497
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,350
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

498

♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

499

♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

500

♫  Have you ever changed?  ♫

501
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,800
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

502
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,450
Don't spend too much time taking a hot bath after drinking.

503
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,490
If you drown, there will be no one to take care of you.

504
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,960
♫  It's been so long ago  ♫

505
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,610
It's just nonsense.

506
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,190
It's no big deal.

507
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,582
Sausage or jam?

508
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,130
Are there any with pickles?

509
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,160
I'll just have buttered bread.

510
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,880
I find you and Dong Siyang have something in common.

511
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,590
Both of you don't act according to common sense.

512
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,000
Our company is badly in need of money,

513
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,670
but he brought us to have fun here.

514
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,842
It's called going off the beaten track.

515
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,040
Li Xun, do you have a backup plan to deal with L &amp; P Company?

516
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,404
I met Fang Zhijing that day.

517
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:06,110
He said he was coming after us.

518
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,280
He said that our game only had word-of-mouth popularity and was profitless.

519
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,072
He could defeat us as long as he moved his hands and feet.

520
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,650
I really hate him.

521
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,552
I left without scolding him.

522
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,270
Are you afraid of him?

523
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,380
Yes.

524
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,560
I'm afraid of him, and I also hate him.

525
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,070
I've hated him for so many years, but I've done nothing to get back at him.

526
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,370
I can only be helplessly angry.

527
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:41,166
When he bullied Xiaoyan, I could only watch.

528
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:45,460
Later, when he hurt you, I could only watch.

529
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,830
You're not afraid of Fang Zhijing.

530
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,830
You're just afraid that we can't defeat them this time.

531
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,160
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be feuding with him.

532
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,180
If I hadn't dragged you to the competition, your sister Li Lan would have been fine.

533
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,680
Zhu Yun,

534
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,320
you've thought too much.

535
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,580
Worrying about everything will only lead to failure in the end.

536
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,750
Take it easy.

537
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,836
Their fear of me is much more than your fear of him.

538
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:23,180
You're afraid of him, so you've been watching him all these years.

539
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,690
They are afraid of me, so they watched me as soon as I came out.

540
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,600
You don't have to worry about them copying our stuff.

541
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,410
If they really developed their own games honestly,

542
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,450
maybe I wouldn't strike back at them in the short term.

543
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,314
However, they target me deliberately and want to eliminate me,

544
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:46,700
so I have the chance to get back at them.

545
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,042
It's fair.

546
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:51,550
You're afraid of him.

547
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,410
They're afraid of me.

548
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,520
Who are you afraid of?

549
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,350
I'm not afraid of anyone.

550
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,080
Silly girl.

551
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,770
You haven't changed.

 If I can't prevent his company from being listed, 

567
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,970
 I'll change my surname and admit my defeat before him.
