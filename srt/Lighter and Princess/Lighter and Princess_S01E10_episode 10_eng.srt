00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:15,940


2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,900
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,380
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,560
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be 
 meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,500
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,940
   

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,120
   

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,440
Students now are quite arrogant.

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,420
You made trouble at such a young age!

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,060
Zhu Yun, you think you are quite great?

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,710
I'm asking you.

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,350
I don't understand what you mean.

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,260
You don't understand?

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,320
You don't understand what I mean?

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,350
I've been responsible for cooperation with universities for so many years,

30
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,700
but for the first time, I met such a bad student like you.

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,670
Only you are great? Only you know everything?

32
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,980
You treat me like a fool.

33
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,520
I really didn't know that students now are so vicious.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,570
You wrote nonsense to embarrass me.

35
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,740
Don't you have the face to be a student?

36
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,820
You insulted your senior deliberately.

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,740
You dare to do that as a student. You'll be more terrible in the workplace.

38
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,110
Zhu Yun, listen.

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,260
What you did is such bad conduct!

40
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,940
You destroyed the school-enterprise cooperation on purpose.

41
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,790
You'll be punished.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,840
Dean Jia, she is young,

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,010
but she did such a terrible thing.

44
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,250
She must take responsibility.

45
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,200
Dean Jia, as her teacher,

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,070
she would never do such a thing.

47
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,700
She wouldn't do it on purpose.

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,330
There is evidence.

49
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,500
She did it on purpose.

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,900
Go back first.

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,030
Xiaobei, I'll figure it out

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,970
and give Xinchuang an explanation.

53
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,220
Thank you, Dean Jia.

54
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,420
Please check it carefully.

55
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,150
I can deal with Xinchuang.

56
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,380
I'll just accept the punishment, because I'm the person in charge after all.

57
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,870
But such behavior has destroyed our school-enterprise cooperation

58
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,770
and brings shame to Nanhu University.

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,470
It'll cause a bad influence on our future cooperation.

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,710
You must punish her severely.

61
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,260
Zhang Xiaobei, you're going too far.

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,080
Zhu Yun is a freshman.

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
You want her to be punished now.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,090
Are you going to ruin her whole life?

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,770
She has to be responsible for her evil deeds. Did I plant her?

66
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,020
Obviously, you robbed their project first.

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,040
Miss Zhang, watch your mouth.

68
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,110
I gave them opportunities, resources, and media exposure.

69
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,900
You said I robbed their project.

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,150
Do you have any evidence? You're blackening my name.

71
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,010
Are you going to destroy the school-enterprise cooperation?

72
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,370
You'd better mind your own business.

73
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,570
It isn't worth sacrificing yourself to protect your student.

74
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,570
Hello.

75
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,980
Go ahead.

76
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,710
What's going on?

77
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,310
Zhang Xiaobei reported to our college

78
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,090
that Zhu Yun programmed like that on purpose to destroy the school-enterprise cooperation.

79
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,260
- How did she convince them? 
 - She prepared for it.

80
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,280
She asked Han Jiakang to copy every version Zhu Yun wrote.

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,130
Han Jiakang even wrote a certificate and signed his name to testify to it.

82
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,410
I have to go.

83
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,280
What are you going to do?

84
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,620
How is Zhu Yun?

85
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,690
What did Zhang Xiaobei promise you?

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,000
Money, project, paper, or doctoral qualification.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
Which one?

88
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,300
She promised to make me a regular worker.

89
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,160
Much cheaper than I thought.

90
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,340
Why do you criticize me?

91
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,650
Why do you blame me?

92
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,250
Obviously, Zhu Yun did wrong.

93
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,440
Why should I protect her regardless of my future?

94
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,230
Who is she?

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,840
Apologize to Zhu Yun.

96
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,840
Are you waiting for me?

97
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,100
The app for Blue Crown.

98
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,100
You gave it to me without hesitation?

99
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,840
Aren't you going to sell it?

100
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,900
Okay.

101
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
I'll overlook what Zhu Yun did.

102
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,220
I would save much effort if I knew I could control you through her.

103
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,840
She caused trouble for me because of you, right?

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,460
Look.

105
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,040
You, students, tried to sacrifice yourselves one after another.

106
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,700
Do you think you're heroes?

107
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,230
Who can protect others?

108
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,100
What's wrong?

109
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,660
You'll regret one day.

110
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,730
 Zhu Yun, Li Xun went to Zhang Xiaobei. 

111
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,280
Li Xun. Li Xun?

112
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,510
 Turn round. 

113
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,180
Why are you sitting here?

114
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,000
Taking a break.

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,540
You gave Zhang Xiaobei the app?

116
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,490
You were there that day, right?

117
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,020
You heard everything when she came to me that day.

118
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,790
In fact, I had guessed what you wanted to do when you went to her.

119
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,270
I just didn't want you to realize that

120
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,340
what you said and did was heard and seen by others.

121
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,450
Princess,

122
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm not that fragile.

123
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,630
What's wrong?

124
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,790
You fool.

125
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,120
You wasted so much time on her.

126
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,390
Never mind. You're the fool.

127
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,120
How much did you earn by selling the app to Zhang Xiaobei?

128
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,110
I can write more apps like that easily.

129
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,790
Get over yourself.

130
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,910
- Well... 
 - No need to say.

131
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:17,420
Li Xun, I'm not a princess or a fool.

132
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,450
Let's wait and see.

133
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,610
Old Gao, why are you sitting here?

134
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,100
Li Xun.

135
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,120
What's wrong?

136
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,660
Can you ask me before making a decision?

137
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,580
Would you have disagreed?

138
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,190
Can't you try another way?

139
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,350
Did you find another way?

140
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,030
Now that the results are the same,

141
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,260
does it make a difference to ask you?

142
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,240
Li Xun, you didn't design the app alone.

143
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,590
I also spent a lot of effort on it.

144
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,510
I just want respect from you.

145
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,490
- Is it hard for you? 
 - I see.

146
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,760
But it was too urgent to ask you.

147
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,180
Old Gao, we were dealing with Zhang Xiaobei.

148
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,140
You know it.

149
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,520
If we hadn't acted quickly, we would have been at a disadvantage.

150
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,140
Instead, we don't need to take offense at her.

151
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,690
Do you agree?

152
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,660
The last time, for the sake of helping Zhu Yun.

153
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,950
You've been staring at it for half an hour.

154
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,900
Will any magic happen?

155
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,930
Hello.

156
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,260
 Mom. 

157
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,690
Yun Yun, it's late. What's up?

158
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
What are you doing, Mom?

159
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,880
Me?

160
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm reading a document.

161
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,080
 What's wrong? 

162
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,340
Nothing's wrong. I just miss you.

163
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,620
I miss you, too.

164
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,810
 How have you been doing recently? 

165
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,590
Yun Yun, is something wrong with you?

166
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,730
No.

167
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,410
 As an experienced educator, I can tell that something is wrong with you. 

168
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,230
Tell me what happened.

169
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,140
Mom, our project manager is too strict with us.

170
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,700
That's normal.

171
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,460
Your base is doing projects.

172
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,170
Certainly you are treated as professionals.

173
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,030
They won't be patient with you like your teachers.

174
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,380
 But that's great. 

175
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,240
 You'll be more capable. 

176
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,620
If they are not strict with you, you won't make progress.

177
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,320
Mom, there is a great decline in my grades.

178
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,320
I was in fourth place at the beginning of this term but in ninth last time.

179
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,360
Why?

180
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,290
- The courses are difficult? 
  - No. 

181
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,050
What's the reason?

182
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,220
An external project director of the Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation

183
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,160
of our Graduate School asked me to help with a project.

184
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,580
Working to a tight schedule, I failed to do it well, so she was mad at me.

185
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,810
It's nonsense.

186
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,890
The Center for School-Enterprise Cooperation of the Graduate School has nothing to do with you undergraduates.

187
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,490
 They even use you freshmen as cheap labor. 

188
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,950
They're going too far.

189
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,210
No. She meant well.

190
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,130
She wanted us to practice more.

191
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,250
Okay. I see.

192
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,070
Forget it.

193
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,110
 I'll ask your dad to deal with it. 

194
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,300
Tell me the name of your manager.

195
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,610
Zhang Xiaobei.

196
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,540
This way, please.

197
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,630
Zhu Yun is a university student.

198
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,370
When I worked with your dad, I held you.

199
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,420
Yes.

200
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,830
You were a little girl.

201
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,530
- How time flies! 
 - This way, please.

202
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,680
- Where is your son? 
 - He is in Britain.

203
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,420
Mr. Qian!

204
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,250
- It's been a long time since we last met. 
 - Come here.

205
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm late. Sorry.

206
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,190
I'll drink later to apologize.

207
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,100
Don't stand there. Come in.

208
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,570
Mr. Wang, do you remember Zhu?

209
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,250
Of course.

210
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,790
Our company asked him for help last year.

211
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

212
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,070
Don't mention that.

213
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,820
Zhu and I are old friends.

214
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,380
We haven't met each other for 2 to 3 years.

215
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,150
Yes.

216
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,250
Now that we have time, let's get together and communicate.

217
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,670
By the way, clear up misunderstandings.

218
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,150
Fine. Let's eat and talk.

219
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
Mr. Qian, Mr. Wang,

220
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,410
Mr. Zhu, Ms. Liu.

221
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,430
I'd like to say something, or I won't be able to eat.

222
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,360
In this case, speak plainly.

223
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,040
First, I admit my mistake.

224
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,640
Being immature and impatient,

225
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,680
I was so eager to make my mark that I made a mistake.

226
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,450
But please trust me.

227
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,840
I meant no harm.

228
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,040
I meant well.

229
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,450
Zhu Yun's ability was recognized when she took part in the Blue Crown Project.

230
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,890
Due to my impatience and bad temper,

231
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,440
I didn't communicate with her well.

232
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,860
Zhu Yun, I apologize to you sincerely.

233
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,210
I went too far before.

234
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,810
I'm really sorry.

235
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,160
Engaging in education,

236
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,140
I know many universities like to cooperate with enterprises.

237
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,580
This is great,

238
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,410
as it can provide students with social practice opportunities.

239
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,190
However,

240
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,940
some employees of enterprises have a weak level of professional competence

241
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,440
and very low moral integrity.

242
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,750
They treat students as cheap labor.

243
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,300
They gain power using all kinds of tricks to bully students.

244
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,550
They resort to desperate means for benefits, affecting students' futures.

245
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,450
Some people even insult students in their work.

246
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,000
That's too much.

247
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,840
I know now some schools and enterprises are under great pressures.

248
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,630
But, Mr. Wang, reputation means a lot to your big company.

249
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:54,370
If it brings disgrace to your company, you'll suffer losses. Right?

250
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,620
Yes.

251
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,560
I'll ask them to check it carefully later.

252
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,620
You must check carefully.

253
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,500
Zhang.

254
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,670
Miss Zhang, in any case, it's rude of you to splash Zhu Yun with water

255
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:21,190
on her face in public.

256
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,950
Yes.

257
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,640
Well, I'll state clearly my stand.

258
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,300
It was caused by my insufficient supervision.

259
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm directly responsible for it.

260
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,780
I'll drink this cup of wine to punish myself.

261
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,780
Okay.

262
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,680
Zhu Yun,

263
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,420
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,810
   

265
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,660
It's gross.

266
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,720
Did anyone bully you again?

267
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,510
What if I bully others?

268
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,350
Do you feel guilty?

269
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,410
No, but I would have felt better if I had defeated her in my own right.

270
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,600
We all have our own family, origin, and contacts.

271
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,030
These are the abilities you just mentioned.

272
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,340
Zhang Xiaobei even bullied you using her company.

273
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,110
But I don't want to be like her.

274
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,000
Do you look down on yourself sometimes?

275
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,070
Never.

276
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,060
You set a high moral threshold.

277
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,580
A wicked person will be harassed by another of like ilk.

278
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,020
Han Jiakang was badly bullied by her.

279
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,240
Just think that you punished her for him.

280
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
 I printed it. 

281
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,740
 Okay. 

282
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,420
 I'm coming. 

283
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,420
You're really a princess.

284
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,000
Don't you work?

285
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,770
Yes.

286
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,180
Tell me if anything happens.

287
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't try to deal with it by yourself.

288
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,720
Same to you.

289
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,450
Tell me if anything happens.

290
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,490
Don't try to deal with it by yourself.

291
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,620
I see,

292
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,150
Your Highness.

293
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,140
Why do you call me like that?

294
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,730
What should I call you?

295
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,280
OId Gao, this search bar doesn't work.

296
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,080
Rewrite it this afternoon.

297
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,720
Okay.

298
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,760
We haven't sold the app?

299
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,000
We will sell it.

300
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
We got it back.

301
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,620
What-What do you mean?

302
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,430
Ask Princess.

303
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,090
You're out of your mind. Send me the progress as soon as possible.

304
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,210
I've fallen behind a lot. I need to speed up.

305
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,070
If I were Old Gao, I would get angry, too.

306
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,840
He spent a long time on developing the app

307
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,090
and paid for installing the motion capture system.

308
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,450
However, you two used it as a flirting tool.

309
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,410
Don't be so harsh.

310
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,490
Li Xun sold it and you took it back at will.

311
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,200
Neither of you asked Gao about that.

312
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,140
I know that. I apologized to him.

313
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,260
He said he was angry for a short while.

314
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,860
But he doesn't seem to be so interested in the project now at the base.

315
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,760
He did whatever Li Xun asked him to do, but he said nothing.

316
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,190
To be honest, I quit because of that.

317
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,120
Li Xun is capable.

318
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,340
But when we stay with him, we have to let go of all our self-esteem and be as humble as possible.

319
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,940
Is it worthwhile?

320
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,010
He is not that ruthless.

321
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,240
You are an exception.

322
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,210
Let me put it this way.

323
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:28,440
He is like anti-virus software, killing every worm except you.

324
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,940
You're his bug.

325
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,190
   

326
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,240
What are you doing?

327
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,140
Princess even walks to class?

328
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,180
By the way, our school just sent a notice that the wall outside the dance room was broken and needed an overhaul.

329
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,870
We can't have aerobics classes, physical education, and dance classes there.

330
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,090
- What do you want to learn? 
 - I don't care.

331
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,240
I'll choose one for you.

332
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,760
Zhu Yun.

333
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,460
I came to say sorry.

334
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,030
You're still thinking about that?

335
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,440
I told you it doesn't matter.

336
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,640
I wasn't going to hide it from Zhang Xiaobei.

337
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,390
They're two different things.

338
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,500
I didn't act like a man.

339
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,470
I look down on myself.

340
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,050
I'm sorry.

341
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,190
I shouldn't frame my friend by going against my conscience.

342
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,580
If you still consider me as your friend.

343
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,590
Sure.

344
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,070
I'm going back to my hometown.

345
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Senior, you're skillful.

346
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,920
Do you really want to go?

347
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,910
I want to change my life.

348
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,760
Actually, I don't like programming at all.

349
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,540
My parents are in poor health.

350
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,560
My fish pond is performing poorly.

351
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,790
To tell you the truth,

352
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,120
I transferred to the Computer Science Department for the high income as a programmer,

353
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,730
so as to support my family.

354
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,660
However, I didn't make money these years.

355
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,450
Besides, I didn't feel happy.

356
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,290
It's a complete waste of life.

357
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,530
I'd rather go back home and help my parents run the fish pond.

358
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,620
I have to catch a train at noon.

359
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,420
See you.

360
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,080
OId Han.

361
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,660
Come to us when you need help.

362
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,420
Thank you.

363
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,380
 What was caused by Zhang Xiaobei came to an end. 

364
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,880
 She was exposed to the media by Xinchuang 

365
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,350
 and left office regretfully, becoming a notorious villain. 

366
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,150
 Finally, the Graduate School restored its integrity. 

367
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,140
For the first time I see him so relaxed.

368
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,010
It's good for him to leave here.

369
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,470
I hope he makes the right choice.

370
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,990
   

371
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,740
♫  Bell tower rings. Pigeons are pure white  ♫

372
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,190
♫  Gulp freedom and ease  ♫

373
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,560
♫  Shrimp soldiers and crab generals are busy  ♫

374
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,370
♫  They persist in believing that they're different  ♫

375
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,580
♫  I'm standing in an empty square  ♫

376
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,250
♫  I look at martyrs' statues with reverence  ♫

377
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,460
♫  I hear the craziest heartbeat  ♫

378
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,180
♫  I catch up with the newborn sun  ♫

379
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,680
Brother Liu, you had your hair cut?

380
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,780
Yes. It was inconvenient.

381
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,080
And someone said it didn't look good.

382
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,770
Well, the boss let you sing here again?

383
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,070
Someone ordered.

384
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,010
We're popular.

385
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,780
This matter...

386
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,070
 Fine. Okay. 

387
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,630
 No problem. 

388
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,390
 Okay. 

389
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,890
There's a clogged toilet. Go fix it.

390
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,340
Okay.

391
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,920
It has nothing to do with him.

392
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,200
- I'll help. 
 - Shut up.

393
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,070
Mr. Wang, Liu is a member of my band.

394
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,270
He came here for performances instead of cleaning.

395
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,920
Is there anyone watching your performance?

396
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,940
If he didn't promise to work as a cleaner back then, you wouldn't be able to sing here again.

397
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,530
Moreover, your poor band can't sell a ticket and wastes my place.

398
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,720
Don't you feel shame?

399
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,860
Come out with me.

400
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
- Listen to me. 
 - Come out with me.

401
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,730
I... I...

402
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,990
Are you out of your mind?

403
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,850
I... I did that to let our band play here.

404
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,350
Who are you trying to move?

405
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,850
You move yourself, but I think you're poor.

406
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,330
I didn't.

407
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,490
- I just want to be nice to you. 
 - I don't need it.

408
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,920
Did I ask you to be nice to me?

409
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,670
Listen!  If you focus on such things instead of the performance of the band, get lost.

410
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,830
My band doesn't need a toilet cleaner.

411
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,450
Is my performance just equal to your cleaning the toilet?

412
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,050
- Ren Di, I like you. 
 - But I don't like you.

413
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,140
Listen! I'll never fall in love with a man who moves me.

414
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,830
No matter how you change, I won't like you.

415
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,020
It won't help even if you cut your head, let alone cutting your hair.

416
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,660
Do you understand? Do you understand?

417
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,520
Never change yourself for others.

418
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,960
It's not worth it.

419
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,730
   

420
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,240
Zhu Yun.

421
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,910
You blushed.

422
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,530
Is it hot?

423
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,700
You're reviewing the Basic Principle of Marxism in the base in front of me.

424
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,150
Do you want to die?

425
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,560
It's lunch time.

426
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,140
Do what you should do in the base.

427
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,520
I need to review, too.

428
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,970
You gave everyone else a day off.

429
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,140
Why don't you give me a day off?

430
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,100
You want me to treat you like how I treat others?

431
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,880
No, but this is not the same thing.

432
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,540
You're not going to have lunch?

433
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,450
I don't deserve it.

434
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:01,070
Productive forces and relations of production are two inseparable aspects of social production.

435
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,490
   

436
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,540
Miss Zhang, I'm Zhu Yun's mom.

437
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,800
Are you in your office?

438
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,580
Mrs. Zhu, don't worry.

439
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,250
Zhu Yun is doing very well in school.

440
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,730
She is clever.

441
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,560
She is responsible as the class rep.

442
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,880
She's in the top set.

443
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,760
Actually, I don't worry about her studies.

444
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,450
As soon as she learns every subject well, she can get postgraduate recommendation or go abroad in the future.

445
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,980
You're far-sighted.

446
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,960
She's just a freshman, but you've planned everything for her.

447
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,670
As her parents, we should master the steering wheel and help her adjust the direction at any time.

448
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,130
Did you ask Zhu Yun about her plan?

449
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,270
She is too young...

450
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,690
to think comprehensively.

451
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,820
Parents should take care of these important events.

452
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,450
Miss Zhang,

453
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:24,090
has there been any boys who are close to Zhu Yun in school recently?

454
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,170
Different from high school, we don't spend all our time with our students.

455
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,610
Moreover, they're all adults.

456
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,210
It's normal for them to date someone.

457
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,300
Legally, she is an adult, but she is immature mentally.

458
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,210
I'm not against her having a boyfriend.

459
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,450
But romance should be beautiful.

460
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,410
Zhu Yun is a simple girl.

461
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,200
I'm worried that she may be hurt by others.

462
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,000
But they are grown-ups.

463
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,300
They have to go their own way.

464
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,900
As her mom, you should trust and respect her.

465
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,600
Okay, Miss Zhang.

466
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm leaving. I want to see Yun.

467
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,900
Okay. I'll lead you there. I think she is at the base.

468
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,000
Okay. Thank you.

469
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,000
The basis of exchange value.

470
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,100
Exchange value is the manifestation of value.

471
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,400
The value, but not the use value, determines the proportion of commodity exchange.

472
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,700
Value is the basis of exchange value

473
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,400
and exchange value is the manifestation of value.

474
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
This is...

475
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,700
Time to have lunch.

476
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,000
Tell me straight, if you want to give me bread.

477
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,600
Value is the basis of exchange value and exchange value is...

478
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
Help me get some water as well.

479
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,300
Exchange goods with different values.

480
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,000
I want cold water.

481
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
The reason why...

482
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,300
The reason why commodities with different use values can be exchanged in a certain proportion

483
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,700
is that they are valuable.

484
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Commodity value in, in governance regulations...

485
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,400
How do you want to be punished?

486
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,100
You hit me first.

487
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,200
I'm reviewing the course, but you interrupt me all the time.

488
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
I can just review it at noon.

489
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,300
I've been busy with the base all term.

490
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,500
I haven't listened to this course well.

491
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,000
It'll be too late if I don't review it now.

492
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,400
Be reasonable, okay?

493
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,300
What are you looking at?

494
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,600
Is there any dirt on my face?

495
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,600
Don't move.

496
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,100
Zhu Yun.

497
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,500
Mom.

498
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,900
Zhu Yun, come here.

499
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,700
Miss Zhang.

500
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,500
Mom, why are you here?

501
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,600
The bureau asked me here for a meeting temporarily.

502
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,700
I didn't have anything to do at noon, so I came to see you.

503
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,600
Your mom seldom comes here.

504
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,300
Stop your work. Go have lunch with her.

505
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,100
Let's go, Mom.

506
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,400
Won't you take your things?

507
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,300
Let's go, Mom. Or the canteen's food will be sold out.

508
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,400
Mom.

509
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Yun, this canteen is great.

510
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,200
I've checked it.

511
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,900
These are organic vegetables and they are cheap.

512
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,100
Don't eat in those restaurants at the gate.

513
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,800
I see. I have too many classes to eat out often.

514
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,500
Although you have many classes in the first year, it's actually the most relaxed period.

515
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,000
Once you are a sophomore or a junior, you should consider graduation.

516
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,200
So I suggest you take part in school activities to increase your practical experience as a freshman.

517
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,800
Okay.

518
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,400
That was your base just now?

519
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,600
Yes. Our base is great.

520
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,200
We freshmen can make money by doing other companies' projects.

521
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,400
You're just a freshman.

522
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,000
Why are you in such a hurry to make money?

523
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No, I mean now we're at the same level as other companies.

524
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,400
The boy just now...

525
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
He is Li Xun, the top of our major.

526
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
He applied to the school for the base.

527
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Are you friends?

528
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Yes.

529
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,800
We were just having fun.

530
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,800
But you may not...

531
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,400
know him very well.

532
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,300
    
 I once punished a student who made a deep impression on me.

533
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,200
 Do you remember your 17th birthday? 

534
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,400
 Happy birthday to you. 

535
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,200
 Who? 

536
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,600
 Are you Director Liu? 

537
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,000
 What can I do for you? 

538
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,500
 I'm from Linyang No. 8 Middle School. 

539
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,400
 My name is Li Xun. 

540
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,100
 I know you. 

541
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,000
 I changed the scores of the unified exams. 

542
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,200
 It has nothing to do with others. 

543
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,400
 You can expel me from school. 

544
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,400
 Cheating in the exams is a serious offense. 

545
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,300
 Neither of you can escape the punishment. 

546
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,800
 This isn't negotiable. 

547
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,000
 Go back now. 

548
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:02,310


549
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,920
   

550
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,500
 Li Xun, are you going to drive me away? 

551
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,300
 I said I don't need you. 

552
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,700
 Can't you understand? 

553
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
 I'm sorry. 

554
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,710
 Hi, could I have your WeChat account? 

555
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,420
 I'm sorry. 

556
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,000
 You should apologize. 

557
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,000
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

558
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

559
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,700
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

561

♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

564
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,500
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

565
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,500
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

566
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:19,600

575
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,500
