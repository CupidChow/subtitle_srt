2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,900
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,520
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,280
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,460
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,340
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,140
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,960
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,480
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,700
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,740
   

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,720
   

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,650
Get up.

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,420
What time is it now?

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,140
What time?

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,520
It's after 10:00.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,690
It's the weekend. Can't you just let me sleep in?

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,010
Come on.

28
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,330
We will have guests here at noon.

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,290
Why don't we eat out?

30
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,200
Haven't you had enough of eating out?

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,880
Get out of bed.

32
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,980
Did you ask Xiuzhu over?

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,820
No.

34
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,020
Why not?

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,600
That's a family dinner. Why should I ask him over?

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,330
He isn't our family.

37
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,170
How ungrateful you are!

38
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,430
He took care of you when you were abroad.

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,650
Now that he is alone in China, of course we have to take care of him.

40
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,820
Even so, I don't have to ask him over.

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,720
Chinese New Year is coming. I think we should have dinner sometime.

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,850
I still owe him old duck soup.

43
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,460
I knew you didn't ask him over. So I did.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,910
The kids are grown up now.

45
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,060
We haven't been together for a long time.

46
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,220
You're Fourth Uncle.

47
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,690
Yeah.

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,500
Fourth Aunt.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,300
You are...

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Second Aunt.

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,070
You see, we Chinese value family affection most.

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,060
How nice it is for the family to sit down together and have a nice meal.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,820
Mom, why are you talking about that? What does it have to do with him?

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,900
Since he is here, we're a family.

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
It'll be a joke if he mistakes our relatives.

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,200
Since when are we a family?

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,730
We are certainly a family.

58
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,240
We have never taken Xiuzhu as an outsider since his childhood.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
Isn't that true?

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,470
Come on. Cheers.

61
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,950
Cheers. Cheers.

62
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,630
So happy.

63
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,970
Xiuzhu, I hear you're going to have an exhibition in France next year.

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,310
Why don't you take Yun with you?

65
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,620
I've already invited her.

66
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,690
Have you agreed?

67
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,400
Are you going with him?

68
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,890
I have to take this.

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,970
- What a kid.   - She is shy. 

70
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,000
- Hello. 
  - Hello! Zhu Yun. 

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,510
 Where are you? 

72
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,270
 Something big has happened. 

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,000
 Don't panic, Zhang Fang. You make it clear. 

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,780
 The background system of our project Invincible General was hacked. 

75
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,430
- Hello. 
  - What is going on now? 

76
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,350
 - Invincible General...  
 - Rest assured.

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,790
Since you're home, stay there.

78
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,840
Leave it to me.

79
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,400
Hello.

80
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,600
   

81
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,390
You said it was okay. You're going to live at the office.

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,810
This is netstat command.

83
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,560
Do you know it?

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,390
I only know that netstat is a program that accesses the network and related information in the kernel,

85
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,290
and can provide reports on the memory management of

86
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,000
the listener process of the transmission control protocol

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,090
and user datagram protocol.

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,270
That's not superficial knowledge.

89
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,690
You want to track down the attacker, huh?

90
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,820
Can you?

91
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,050
No.

92
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,170
Only the current connection can be displayed.

93
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,740
We won't find him out until he attacks us.

94
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,330
What if we create a schedule?

95
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,360
We can have the system automatically send commands at regular intervals

96
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,930
in case he happens to bump into it.

97
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,380
He is not such a green hand.

98
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,480
Do you know him?

99
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,350
You know him, too.

100
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,940
Hou Ning.

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,350
- I'll call the police. 
 - Don't call the police.

102
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,060
This is all I have here. Make do with it.

103
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,860
Why doesn't Hou Ning behave himself?

104
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,240
Do you think I behave myself?

105
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,470
I'm talking about it as it stands. It's not an insinuation.

106
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,160
I understand how you feel about him.

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,330
But you guys are different.

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,910
What's the difference?

109
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,300
We were in the same cell.

110
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,460
Besides, he is strong, much stronger than you.

111
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,340
That would be the best. Bring him on board.

112
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,520
With the two of you plus Dong Siyang, our company will be renamed the Reformer Alliance.

113
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,310
I know he's a friend of yours.

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,140
But I am petty.

115
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,340
I don't want to admit that...

116
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,370
you're just like other people in prison.

117
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,000
My mother forced me to learn computer science at the beginning.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,360
But I got into programming because of you.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,600
I have to admit that you got me interested in programming,

120
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,510
and you convinced me that technology can benefit society,

121
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,000
so I look down on those who use technology for evil,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,140
and those who are complacent after doing evil even more.

123
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,870
Hou Ning was in prison for some reason.

124
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,710
He was withdrawn...

125
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,930
and was bullied badly when he was a kid.

126
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,890
Later, someone saw that he had good computer skills and made friends with him.

127
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,570
His friend tricked him into hacking accounts.

128
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,040
He spent six months in jail.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,800
When he got out, his friend came to him again.

130
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,080
- He believed him again... 
 - And was arrested again?

131
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,300
This technology isn't bad?

132
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,460
He was caught twice in all.

133
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,780
He was caught for the first time because his friend was too greedy, giving the game away.

134
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,290
He was caught for the second time because his friend benefited from both sides.

135
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,760
He asked Hou Ning to steal important information of a company and sold it for a large amount of money.

136
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,940
The boss of that company offered a reward to catch the hacker.

137
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,180
His friend came out and sold him.

138
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,770
You can't always defend him like that. He was already in jail once.

139
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,830
However, he didn't repent.

140
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,300
He was out of luck.

141
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not about bad luck.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,520
He knew what he was doing.

143
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,510
By bad luck, I mean he didn't have anyone around to pull him up.

144
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,610
You're awake?

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,070
Drink some water.

146
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,090
I can't feel my legs.

147
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,090
Are you unwell?

148
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,270
How many nights have you been up?

149
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,740
It was the same case in the van during the last team building.

150
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,090
Go to the hospital sometime.

151
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,100
You got up so early.

152
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Going to bed early and getting up early makes us healthy.

153
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,870
I don't see you going to bed early.

154
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,490
The early bird catches the worm.

155
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,460
I'm going out to buy breakfast. What kind of worm are you going to eat?

156
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,660
Steamed buns stuffed with pickled worms.

157
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,950
You made do with it last night.

158
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,400
You have to catch up today.

159
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,980
Let's go.

160
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,680
Let's go to have a meal.

161
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,040
You live by photosynthesis, huh?

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,580
Nothing in the fridge. What do you eat?

163
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,300
Would you like braised beef or stewed chicken and mushroom?

164
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,810
Are you such a good cook?

165
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,560
   
   

166
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,060
You won't eat anything but instant noodles.

167
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,340
I'll eat it if you cook it.

168
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,990
I'll cook it if you eat it.

169
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,340
I'll eat it if you cook it.

170
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,180
Hello, here is your order.

171
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,730
Thank you.

172
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,670
What are you looking at?

173
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,780
You've shaved all the meat off.

174
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,590
- You do it. 
 - I can't.

175
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,850
Then shut up.

176
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,550
Now, I want to know what to do next.

177
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,030
Add it now. Add what?

178
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,870
- Green onion. 
 - Green onion?

179
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,360
- Ginger. 
 - Are you sure?

180
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,010
How did you live before?

181
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,750
You don't know how to cook, either.

182
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,230
That's normal.

183
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,510
We live and eat for free in prison. Hou Ning used to do all this.

184
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,640
Do you think we can settle it by giving him some money?

185
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,700
Do you think he's after the money?

186
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,420
He's got a lot of character.

187
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,140
And that stupid game has no money.

188
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,190
Don't take the opportunity to belittle my game.

189
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,520
He just won't let me leave him alone.

190
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,010
He's not a kid anymore.

191
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,540
He does act like a kid.

192
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,850
What should we do?

193
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,140
I'll try to contact him.

194
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,280
Did he get much data by hacking the background system?

195
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,050
Our system is susceptible in front of him.

196
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,520
When to invade and to what extent depends on his mood.

197
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,400
Apply cornstarch.

198
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,510
What's cornstarch?

199
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,850
- I don't know. 
 - This one.

200
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,710
Do it before cooking.

201
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,780
- Now you... 
 - No, I'm going to fry it.

202
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,980
- Coming. 
 - Let me take a look.

203
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,430
It isn't open.

204
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,900
It's burned. There is smashed cucumber.

205
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,810
Make do with it.

206
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,930
How does it taste?

207
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,430
Tasty.

208
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,140
Braised beef or stewed chicken and mushroom?

209
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,300
It is a question.

210
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,030
- Have you figured out what to do with it? 
 - Not yet.

211
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,850
Well, think again.

212
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,590
I've thought about it.

213
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,400
I have no way.

214
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,680
You can't eat it. It's a waste of food.

215
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,860
Zhang Fang is right. You're incapable.

216
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,450
Which one do you want?

217
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,640
- Don't you hate me? 
 - No.

218
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,680
Give me another bite.

219
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,240
Hou Ning!

220
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,040
He found you tracking him. That's normal.

221
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,260
    
 He even translated for me.

222
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,830
He thinks I can't read English, huh?

223
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,770
He values UE (user experience).

224
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,230
- You're going to do your dirty game again. Aren't you looking for Hou Ning? 
 - No.

225
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,780
No?

226
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,620
I can't find him. Waste of time.

227
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,240
What if he attacks again?

228
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,840
Let him come. I'm not afraid.

229
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,010
It's not my project.

230
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,010
It's no use staring at me.

231
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,620
I'm in charge of my project. You don't care. I do.

232
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,340
I don't believe I can't find him.

233
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,210
Good luck to you.

234
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,140
Then give me the general direction.

235
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,750
Do you give up to me?

236
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,720
You are the one who has provoked him.

237
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,050
I find you've really changed a lot.

238
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,420
Did you ever talk to me like that?

239
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,470
A desperate rabbit will bite.

240
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,600
Yeah.

241
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,040
Even a worm will turn.

242
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,790
You're nice to everyone except me.

243
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,940
Can you be objective?

244
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,960
To tell the truth, who cooks for you and who cleans for you?

245
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,580
You can't survive a few days without me.

246
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
You fed me your burned fish.

247
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,830
That's because you interrupted me.

248
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,610
I told you I would cook. You didn't listen to me.

249
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,810
Can you?

250
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,890
Yes. I'll walk you downstairs.

251
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,650
You haven't paid me yet.

252
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,990
I haven't paid you yet?

253
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,320
- You want to get paid? 
 - Yeah.

254
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,940
How much do you want?

255
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,120
How much is it for an hour?

256
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,740
Is 50 yuan enough?

257
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,280
Kind of.

258
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,380
- Go. 
 - Okay.

259
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,950
You don't have your coat. Come back.

260
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,870
You don't have your coat.

261
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,210
It snows.

262
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,520
It's so cold. You don't have to see me off. Go upstairs.

263
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,140
I'm not cold.

264
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,200
It melted.

265
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,920
Maybe you're more cold-blooded.

266
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,690
 Li Xun, 

267
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,680
 do you have any dreams? 

268
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,430
 To go on like this. 

269
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,710
Then I'll go first.

270
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,250
Princess.

271
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,360
 I have something to announce. 

272
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,270
 This is the princess I invited here. 

273
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,180
 Why do you call me princess? 

274
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,680
 What should I call you? 

275
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,720
 Li Xun, what kind of person do you think can be called a princess? 

276
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,450
 First, she must have a pair of lofty eyes. 

277
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,290
 In addition, she must have an innocent and fragile heart. 

278
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,880
♫  Now the world, it is upside down  ♫

279
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,290
Let me know when you get home.

280
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,120
♫  And we were floating on the sky  ♫

281
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,140
♫  Now the world, it is upside down  ♫

282
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,780
♫  Beause I'm so loving you  ♫

283
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,860
♫  Now the world, it is upside down  ♫

284
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:06,520
♫  And we were floating on the sky  ♫

285
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,680
♫  Now the world, it is upside down  ♫

286
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,380
♫  Because I'm so loving you  ♫

287
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,140
♫  And you loved me, too  ♫

288
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,150
Did you find the guy who hacked us?

289
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,510
It's not that easy.

290
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,310
I heard he knew Li Xun.

291
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,110
Don't be a busybody.

292
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,250
Li Xun!

293
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,980
What on earth is going on?

294
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,660
Look!  They've become buddies.

295
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,720
What do you think they're working on?

296
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,080
It's easy to guess.

297
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,020
Think about it.

298
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,190
What's the toughest thing for the company right now?

299
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,760
Hacker.

300
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,350
Li Xun found the right one.

301
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,420
With Mr. Dong here, the hacker is basically stuck.

302
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,390
Mr. Dong doesn't know how to use computers. How can he catch the hacker?

303
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,860
You are just too rigid.

304
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,980
Who do you think Mr. Dong is?

305
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,570
As long as you give him a phone and a photo, there is no one in this city that he can't find.

306
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,720
Why didn't Li Xun go to Mr. Dong in the first place?

307
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:44,920
He may be afraid of how Mr. Dong deals with it

308
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,380
when he finds the hacker.

309
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,570
What does it mean?

310
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,310
Mr. Dong always plays around with us.

311
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,210
If he gets really mad...

312
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,490
What will he do?

313
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,970
He is Mr. Dong.

314
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,740
What's up?

315
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,380
What did you discuss with Dong Siyang?

316
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,590
How are you going to find Hou Ning?

317
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,350
I don't know.

318
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,780
I always feel a little uneasy.

319
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,110
There is nothing to worry about.

320
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,630
Dong Siyang is more nervous than we are.

321
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,820
We can start again as many times as we fail.

322
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,310
He can't afford that anymore.

323
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,980
He's betting it all on our company.

324
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,280
If he wins, he bounces back.

325
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,870
If he loses, L &amp; P stomps him to death.

326
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,630
Do you get me?

327
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,520
But if not for us, Fang Zhijing and Gao Jianhong would not target the company.

328
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,480
What are you talking about?

329
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,490
People don't have to die if they keep their necks down, huh?

330
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,190
Remember. There are only two roads in this world.

331
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,810
One is waiting for death, the other is looking for death.

332
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,990
Dong Siyang is not a man waiting for death, and neither are we.

333
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,690
So you can rest assured.

334
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,790
He will find Hou Ning.

335
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,690
That's what I'm most worried about.

336
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,770
Zhang Fang said if Mr. Dong was really mad...

337
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,180
Don't listen to that blabbermouth.

338
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,760
Dong Siyang has a sense of propriety.

339
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,300
You mustn't do anything stupid again.

340
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,630
Mind your own business, and don't worry about it.

341
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,900
This is my own business.

342
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,980
   

343
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,950
Has Hou Ning been found?

344
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,050
What will Dong Siyang do after finding Hou Ning?

345
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,720
I have no idea.

346
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,980
Why don't you get in touch with Dong Siyang?

347
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,710
I can't reach him.

348
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,650
You didn't even try.

349
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,030
Here we go again!

350
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,900
Are you finished?

351
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,820
If you want to know, ask yourself.

352
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,590
I can't find him.

353
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,350
Why don't you go back to your place?

354
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,420
You don't have any job, do you?

355
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,760
We must settle this matter today.

356
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,100
- It's no use you worrying about it all day. 
 - Why not?

357
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,390
I'm going to warn you one last time.

358
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,240
Blind Box of Love is winding down.

359
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,710
You can do this if you want, but not now.

360
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,060
You're not getting anything done until this is worked out today.

361
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,690
That's what you did last time.

362
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,450
Zhu Yun...

363
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,770
That's what you did three years ago.

364
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,960
We let it be when you were irritable and went crazy.

365
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,620
No one asked you if you didn't say it.

366
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,090
But you ended up spending three years in prison.

367
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,690
There are better ways to do it.

368
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,020
We can do the project at any time.

369
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,770
If we can't do this one, we can do the next one.

370
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,390
But it's too late if you make a mistake.

371
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,110
Do you still remember what Mr. Lin said to you?

372
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,140
Follow the right path.

373
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,580
Mr. Dong said he would have a sense of propriety.

374
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,870
Is his sense of propriety the same as that of normal people?

375
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,310
You looked for him yourself and didn't leave it to Dong Siyang at the beginning

376
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,810
just because you were afraid that Mr. Dong was too cruel. Right?

377
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,180
I just want him to be cruel.

378
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,670
What do you mean by that?

379
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,950
Hou Ning needs to learn a lesson.

380
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,330
I'm going to use him, but he's unscrupulous right now

381
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,430
because of some skills.

382
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,860
Dong Siyang should teach him a good lesson.

383
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,010
Well, what if Dong doesn't do it properly?

384
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,070
- He wouldn't. 
 - What does that mean?

385
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,550
No, you have to follow him.

386
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,360
Just in case. You need to call him right now.

387
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,350
Okay.

388
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,960
Hello.

389
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,620
How was it? Did you find him?

390
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,040
Yes?

391
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,940
Give me the address and I'll be there now.

392
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,800
Why are there two vans?

393
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,140
I hope there's nothing wrong.

394
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,340
I'll check it out. You wait here.

395
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,350
I'll go in and have a look. You wait in the car.

396
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,620
Close the windows and lock the doors.

397
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,120
Okay.

398
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,550
Let go of me.

399
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,920
I'm telling you, I know who you are.

400
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,430
You are the boss of My Heart Flying Network Company.

401
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,270
You used to be a jerk and even did time.

402
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,380
Didn't you do time?

403
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,590
Let me go.

404
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,160
Li Xun.

405
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,400
Li Xun, you're such a jerk. You ganged up on me.

406
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,410
So much nonsense.

407
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,720
Ganged up on you?

408
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,170
Why did you hack my system?

409
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,860
You deserve it.

410
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,320
Go on.

411
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,040
Let go of me.

412
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,900
Work this out between you two.

413
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,260
Don't be polite to him.

414
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,970
Do you hear me?

415
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,340
Hou Ning.

416
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,650
Turn around.

417
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,860
Be a man.

418
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm a man.

419
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,640
You ganged up on me, didn't you?

420
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,660
I'm telling you. I'm telling you, you dare not to let go.

421
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,040
You dare not to let go.

422
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,150
- I dare not? 
 - You dare not.

423
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,870
Do I dare?

424
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,230
I'm telling you, L &amp; P is still on top of you.

425
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,140
You still haven't got your woman back. Don't do this.

426
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,630
Do I dare?

427
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,330
- Do I dare? 
 - You do. You do. You do.

428
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,400
- Do I dare? 
 - You do.

429
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,800
Hou Ning,

430
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,600
if you do something wrong, you will be punished.

431
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
 Li Xun! 

432
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,070
Let's go.

433
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,870
Did you see it?

434
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,750
It was nothing.

435
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,120
Hou Ning is fine. He's really fine.

436
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,910
Look at Hou Ning. Isn't he there?

437
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,820
 If you do something wrong, you will be punished. 

438
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,990
He's really fine. We were just trying to scare him.

439
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,570
I've been regretting it.

440
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,300
I've been regretting it abroad that I didn't stop you.

441
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,760
I was afraid you'd do something stupid again on impulse.

442
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:34,100
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

443
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,560
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

444
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,860
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

445
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,220
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

446
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,110
I won't.

447
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,300
I know what I am doing.

448
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,280
You said there was no one around Hou Ning to pull him up.

449
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,740
I was around you, but I did not pull you up.

450
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:06,300
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

451
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,580
He said I was your knight,

452
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,820
but I was the first one to leave you.

453
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,170
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

454
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,700
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

455
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,220
♫  The one by your side is me  ♫

456
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,420
It wasn't your fault.

457
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,940
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

458
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,240
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

459
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,230
I promise you.

460
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,700
I will never destroy myself again.

461
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,680
♫  That hot firework  ♫

462
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:08,720
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

463
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,920
What you're doing is very bad, okay?

464
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,230
Yes. Yes.

465
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,670
   

466
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,490
But we were just messing around.

467
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,270
Messing around?

468
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,410
To put it bluntly, you were kidnapping and using intimidation.

469
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,750
If Hou Ning hadn't let you go, you'd all be in custody.

470
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,290
This is a really bad case.

471
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,370
We won't do it again.

472
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,820
But I was so angry at the time.

473
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,740
That brat...

474
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,940
I was too impulsive. I was too impulsive.

475
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,250
You can't break the law just because someone else did.

476
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,440
Shall we detain Hou Ning for hacking into your background system?

477
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,920
We won't hold him accountable.

478
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,300
You're tied, huh?

479
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,170
Give and take, right?

480
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,910
Do you think I have anything to add to this letter of self-criticism?

481
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,840
Why do you think they were so bold?

482
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,610
That's quite normal, because you are bold, too.

483
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,770
When Li Xun first got out of prison,

484
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,480
you didn't know anything about it,

485
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,930
but you were just desperate to help him.

486
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,290
That's not the same.

487
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,150
What's the difference?

488
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:31,680
Men are desperate for a career, while women are lawless for love.

489
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,420
God is fair.

490
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,220
I've always been scared, and I've been even more scared since he got out.

491
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,300
I feel like a frightened bird.

492
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,170
I fear more afraid of his accidents than his failures.

493
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,380
Don't panic! That's okay.

494
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,810
He behaves himself for the time being because you're with him.

495
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,610
So I decided not to go.

496
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm not leaving again.

497
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,870
 What's this mess? 

498
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,900
 Who are those guys? 

499
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,820
 I haven't seen them before. 

500
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,520
What are you guys doing here?

501
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,200
- Who are you? 
 - I'm an employee here.

502
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,040
- What are you doing here? 
 - I'm here to work.

503
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,340
Don't you have the day off? What are you doing here?

504
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,270
Where is Hou Ning?

505
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,690
Are you unlawfully detaining him?

506
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,810
Nonsense. We are not.

507
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,260
I just received education at the police station.

508
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,220
We brought him here and offered him good food and drinks.

509
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,520
He went in and hasn't come out.

510
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,490
We couldn't talk him out of it.

511
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,650
You can talk to him.  Persuade him.

512
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:48,260


513
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,970
   

514
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:54,000
 You don't want to see Li Xun stand up. Right? 

515
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,540
 As long as Li Xun farts, you would come up and smell it. 

516
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,790
 What are you doing? 

517
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,270
 In the past, you copied others. 

518
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:03,520
 Now you dare to steal the source code? 

519
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,040
 I will give them the source code directly. 

520
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,990
 Companies like that are not worthy to be our competitors. 

521
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,660
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

522
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,840
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

523
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:28,440
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

♫  Avoid the hustle and bustle by staying with me  ♫

528
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,300
♫  It's the center crease of your palm  ♫

529
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,340
♫  That holds me up by giving me the courage to move forward  ♫

530
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:05,400
♫  Just like a burning flame in the night  ♫

♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

539
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,240

540
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,300
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

545
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,680
♫  As long as I am brave enough  ♫

546

♫  Every dream that I have  ♫
