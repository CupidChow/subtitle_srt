00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,700
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,380
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,280
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,660
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,120
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,000
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,200
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,040
   

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,020
   

22
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,550
   

23
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,780
What's wrong? You're unhappy?

24
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,380
Don't want to leave?

25
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,950
I haven't finished my work yet, but the app must be submitted tomorrow.

26
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,530
Don't worry.

27
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,290
Li Xun is capable.

28
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,980
It won't be delayed.

29
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,320
Dad, you also think he is reliable?

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,690
How can I say it?

31
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,570
Sometimes a man's hunch is right.

32
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,030
He is good.

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,600
But, Dad, how did you know where the base was?

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,980
Mom told to you?

35
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,300
No wonder you happened to have a meeting there.

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,510
Mom really went too far.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,410
However, Dad, you must see that I really worked there.

38
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,030
Yeah.

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,390
You were indeed busy at work and even bought many medicines.

40
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,810
Dad.

41
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,860
A'Yun, remember.

42
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,360
I caught you in the classroom for the Party class.

43
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,960
Understand?

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,440
Yes.

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,470
I want to spend the Spring Festival happily.

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,240
Xiuzhu, I almost couldn't recognize you.

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,650
Long time no see, Zhu Yun.

48
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,650
Your further studies abroad weren't in vain.

49
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,180
Long time no see, Uncle.

50
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,360
You've matured.

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,600
- Let me do it. 
 -  Okay.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
Xiuzhu reassures you.

53
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,310
I'm flattered. Yun is also excellent.

54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,740
- Aunt. 
 - Yun, hurry up.

55
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,930
You haven't seen Aunt Jiang for four years.

56
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,610
Once she heard that you would come back, she proposed dining together.

57
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,650
- She favors you. 
 - You exaggerated it.

58
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,650
Yun, your New Year's gift.

59
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,190
I still can get a New Year's gift as a university student?

60
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,600
Yes. I specially chose the intensive wave water flosser of sky love color for you.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,820
It looks good and has a good cleaning function. Do you like it?

62
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,890
Aunt, you have good taste.

63
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,820
My classmate has one, and I was going to buy one.

64
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,030
Really?

65
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,700
Come for dinner.

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,920
- All right. Let's go. 
 - Okay. Go to have dinner.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,330
Yun Yun, you sit next to Xiuzhu.

68
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,190
Then you can have a chat.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,360
- Okay. 
 - I'll sit next to you.

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,420
- Come on. Okay. 
 - Thank you.

71
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,230
So many dishes.

72
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,700
- Mom. 
 - Thanks for your work!

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,730
 - A dish and a soup haven't been served yet.  
 - Two dishes haven't been served.

74
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,160
Well,

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,140
we seemed to send them to primary school yesterday,

76
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,090
- but now they go to university. 
 - Yeah.

77
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,290
It's still vivid in my mind. Make room for this.

78
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,300
- Come on. 
 - Let me serve the soup.

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
- Come on. Move here. 
 - Do you remember?

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,590
      
 Back then, they played at eating chicken wings,

81
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,410
      
 and Yun won, at last. Right?

82
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,070
      
 But Yun was almost sent to the hospital,

83
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,260
- because she ate too many chicken wings. 
  -  Why won't he reply on WeChat? 

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,850
 - Is he better?  
 - Do you remember it?

85
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,190
What?

86
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,080
We mentioned that game.

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,170
You ate 50-odd chicken wings.

88
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,270
Stop. I'm ashamed of it.

89
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,340
It's glorious. You shouldn't feel ashamed.

90
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,720
Come on. Come on. Come on. Toast your return.

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,410
Welcome. Welcome back.

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,330
What's up? University matters?

93
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,280
No.

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,690
Whose message are you waiting for?

95
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,970
I'm checking my scores. The final exam results may be released today.

96
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,680
- You must be No. 1 again. 
 - No.

97
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,530
    
 Our class has a top scorer in the college entrance examination. He is awesome.

98
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,720
The scores of your subjects are all high.

99
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,200
An Introduction to the Fundamental Principles of Marxism.

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,070
97.

101
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,430
I don't get a full mark by 3 points.

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,330
Only 3 points. Your score is high enough.

103
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,450
After all, the world isn't perfect, either.

104
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,070
 What's his score? 

105
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,750
Yun Yun, you need to learn from Xiuzhu.

106
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,140
His many paintings are on show around the world.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,410
Yeah.

108
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,060
Two days ago, a painting was on show in the municipal art gallery.

109
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,730
I went there.

110
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,730
You went there?

111
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,090
Xiuzhu, you didn't tell me.

112
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,530
We didn't meet each other.

113
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,460
Didn't you say that you had no time to go, didn't you?

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,040
Delicious.

115
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,870
Dad.

116
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,340
She went there today.

117
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,410
After I picked Yun Yun up, we especially

118
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,040
- went to the art gallery and just saw your... large... 
 - Poster.

119
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,170
...poster. Yes.

120
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,830
- It's very high. 
 - So we indeed went there. 
 - Yes.

121
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,800
Thanks for your support.

122
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,650
Well, I hope Yun Yun can also go abroad for further studies in the future.

123
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,240
What she majors in is not important.

124
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,720
What's more, she should go abroad to widen her vision. Right?

125
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,870
If you have any questions about going abroad,

126
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,560
you can ask us about it at any time.

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,330
If you really plan to do it, you have to be well-prepared early.

128
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,420
As a freshman, I haven't thought about this yet.

129
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,930
You can ask Xiuzhu whether further studies abroad is good or not.

130
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,050
Xiuzhu, is the moon really fuller abroad?

131
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,870
The moon is the same abroad.

132
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,470
However, foreign food is definitely worse than that of our hometown,

133
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,060
especially the food you cooked has surpassed those of Chinese restaurants abroad.

134
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,850
He praises my cooking skill.

135
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,300
- He was telling the truth. 
 - I'm flattered.

136
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,920
Your cooking skill is getting better and better.

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
You must have been cooking at home these years.

138
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,770
 I send him message again? 

139
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,210
     

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,100
     

141
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,060
 Have you recovered from the cough? 

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,760
 The final exam results have been released. 

143
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,100
 I got 97 in the exam on Marxism. 

144
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,340
   

145
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,510
Did he fall ill?

146
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,240
 Why is your score higher than mine? 

147
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,500
Hello.

148
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,130
Hello.

149
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,950
It's me.

150
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,140
I know.

151
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,760
Do you feel better?

152
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,340
You fool.

153
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,340
The cold medicines you bought me treats wind-heat type common cold,

154
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,140
but I got a cold due to coldness.

155
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,050
I almost died from your medicines.

156
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm sorry. How did you settle it?

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,520
I asked someone to send the medicines to me.

158
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,470
That's good.

159
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,740
Have you had dinner?

160
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,200
 Yes. 

161
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,200
Who sent you the medicines? I should thank her.

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,550
Liu Sisi.

163
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,120
Liu Sisi? Didn't she go home?

164
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,600
She came back.

165
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,010
Why?

166
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,500
To send me the medicines.

167
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,840
 Well, I'll hang up soon. I have something to do. 

168
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,720
Wait. Wait. She also sent you the dinner?

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,290
Hello?

170
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,760
Oh, no.

171
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,410
I shouldn't have underestimated my enemy.

172
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,120
Zhu Yun, you're so different that you don't go to the shopping mall

173
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,080
but come here on New Year's Eve.

174
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,530
You hadn't come back for long, so I lead you here to take a look.

175
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,700
You're interested in this?

176
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,770
It's also a kind of art. You should have a look.

177
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,970
How much is this?

178
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,800
180 yuan.

179
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,340
Sir, can you repair it?

180
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,000
It's badly damaged.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,410
How was it damaged?

182
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,090
A car ran over it.

183
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,660
I heard that you have various accessories.

184
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,740
You found the right repairer.

185
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,520
You really want to repair it?

186
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,560
You'll be charged much.

187
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,700
How much?

188
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,150
950 yuan.

189
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,820
It's so high.

190
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,300
Can't you give a discount?

191
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,570
This is an old lighter. It's hard to find all its parts.

192
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,180
I even need to tear down other antiques in my shop to collect all the parts for you.

193
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,200
This lighter can't be restored somewhere else.

194
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,720
- Let's go somewhere else. 
 - No problem.

195
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,570
I'll pay you 950 yuan. Repair it.

196
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,210
When can you restore it?

197
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,310
After the Spring Festival.

198
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm on holiday.

199
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,190
I'll give you 1,000 yuan to make it a round figure, but you must restore it today.

200
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,500
You're domineering.

201
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,600
Okay. I'm on duty

202
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,430
Take it easy. I'll wait for you here.

203
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,220
Zhu Yun,

204
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,400
why didn't you bargain but raised the price for him instead?

205
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,600
You also heard that only he can restore this lighter.

206
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,380
Whose lighter is that?

207
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,750
My classmate's.

208
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,520
Such an important classmate?

209
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,640
An ordinary classmate.

210
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,910
 Hello. 

211
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,680
Hello, it's me.

212
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,150
What's the matter?

213
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,420
Nothing.

214
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm calling you to ask about the app of Blue Crown.

215
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,590
Is it okay?

216
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,210
It's okay.

217
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,090
Tonight is New Year's Eve.

218
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,740
You're still at the university?

219
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,390
 No. 

220
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,820
You're home?

221
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,750
No.

222
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,890
Where are you?

223
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,420
Li Xun, hurry up!

224
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,580
We must get on the bus.

225
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,170
You're with Liu Sisi?

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,530
We'll be on the same bus.

227
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,970
Anything else?

228
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,270
 You-You two... 

229
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,000
Bye.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,050
Hello? Hello?

231
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,000
- Okay? 
 - No. The left side is low.

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
- The left side is low. 
 - Move it upward.

233
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,980
Like this?

234
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,650
   
 Liu Sisi. 

235
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,100
 She just shared a photo in Moments. 

236
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,930
- Move it upward. Move it upward. 
  - Is he behind her in the photo? 

237
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,810
Yes.

238
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,810
- Really? 
 - Yes. Yes. Yes.

239
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,890
 No. His hair style doesn't look like this. 

240
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,200
I feel it's almost horizontal.

241
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,270
You can't help me at all.

242
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,900
Let me go down to have a look.

243
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,000
Yun Yun, help me.

244
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,750
- Dad. 
 - What if I fall down? We can't have a happy New Year.

245
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,720
- Watch out. 
 - Right?

246
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,960
- You only played with your phone. 
 - You should be blamed.

247
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,410
Look. Isn't it tilted?

248
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:19,280
Yes, it is.

249
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,520
Which side is tilted?

250
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,150
This?

251
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,520
A small number of foreigners are still biased against Chinese people. 
    

252
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,810
It doesn't matter.

253
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,210
- In foreign countries... 
  - Is that him? 

254
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,340
 Did he go or not? Where does he have the Spring Festival? 

255
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,540
      
 Right?

256
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,140
 He doesn't reply again. 

257
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,700
At present, many students don't go abroad for further study but for a diploma.

258
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,100
Of course. Not everyone can be like Xiuzhu.

259
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,300
However, given Yun Yun's major,

260
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,800
I think she should go abroad to broaden her international vision.

261
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
Am I right?

262
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,170
Don't play with your phone.

263
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,500
Talk about how you think about going abroad.

264
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
It's good to stay in China.

265
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,570
For our major, practice is very important.

266
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,470
It's also good to work early.

267
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Well, you're wrong.

268
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,230
If you major in computer abroad,

269
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,410
you can join major companies such as Microsoft and Google in the future.

270
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,300
It's better than studying in China and then joining a small company.

271
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,710
Right?

272
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,300
Those who have been educated abroad really have good taste.

273
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,100
Look at this plate picked by Xiuzhu today.

274
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,170
The dumplings look high-end, don't they?

275
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,510
You exaggerate. He bought them casually when I waited for a lighter to be repaired. It's common.

276
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,190
Why do you have a lighter?

277
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,000
What's more, a lighter needs, needs to be repaired?

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,450
Show it to me.

279
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,540
The Spring Festival Gala will begin soon.

280
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,070
Repair...

281
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,980
 Is that him? 

282
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,830
 Impossible. 

283
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,230
I'm going to answer a call of nature.

284
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,240
You answer a call of nature during dinner?

285
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,210
 Did I mistake him? 

286
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,770
   

287
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,220
- Hello. 
  - Hello. 

288
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,780
Happy New Year.

289
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,870
 Happy. 

290
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,010
Have you and Liu Sisi gotten home?

291
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,590
 Not yet. 

292
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,820
It's still so late, and you haven't gotten home yet?

293
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,800
 Which of your ears heard that I was going home with her? 

294
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,240
Where are you?

295
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,250
It's snowing.

296
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,700
Li Xun, was that you?

297
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah.

298
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,680
How do you know where my house is?

299
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,540
I have been here before.

300
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,150
Then wait for me.

301
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,140
Yun Yun, where are you going?

302
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,120
The apples you want have been cut into pieces. Eat some.

303
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,500
Well, Mom, I'm going to fetch a parcel.

304
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,880
You stay at home. I'll go. It's very cold outside.

305
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,050
- No need. 
 - Nonsense.

306
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,140
No deliveryman is on duty on New Year's Eve.

307
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,130
I'm going to see if it's snowing heavily.

308
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,800
It's snowing heavily. Don't go.

309
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,200
You just had dinner.

310
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,320
How about this? You eat the apple first.

311
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
Let's go and enjoy it after playing cards.

312
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,910
Have some first.

313
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,690
How many of your cards are left?

314
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,520
Two.

315
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,410
I win again.

316
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,970
So unlucky.

317
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,930
Yun Yun, you're so absent-minded that you haven't won yet.

318
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,980
How can I win with you as my rival?

319
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,400
I agree. You're the landlord in our family.

320
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,030
Why is he silent?

321
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,420
      
 So you always fight against me?

322
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,800
      
 Come on.

323
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,610
      
 - Go on. Go on. 
 - Go on?

324
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,550
- No. I'm sleepy. 
  - Are you still online? 

325
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,380
    
 - I'm, I'm sleepy. 
 - Sleepy?

326
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm bored. The Spring Festival is getting more and more boring.

327
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,500
Three people are not even enough for playing mahjong.

328
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,450
    
 I'm almost frozen to death.

329
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,900
What's up?

330
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,710
- What's up?  
 - Dad. Mom. I'm taking out the trash.

331
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,250
Take care.

332
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,440
Hello, I'm out. Where are you?

333
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,050
 Girl, it's only now that you come out. 

334
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,560
 It's snowing so heavily. 

335
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,420
 Are you going to dig out my body? 

336
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,010
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,110
You went back?

338
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,790
 Do you know where Lihua Hotel is? 

339
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,650
The one near our house?

340
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,210
 I stay there. Come if you're free. 

341
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,350
What do you mean?

342
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,590
Hello? Hello?

343
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,110
 Lihua Hotel. He wants me to see him? 

344
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,400
Yun Yun, you've been out dumping the trash for so long.

345
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,340
Come back now!

346
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,600
Okay!

347
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,350
It's freezing.

348
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,300
How can I do this as a girl?

349
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,170
I won't.

350
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,350
   

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,300
Will he be frightened by my looks?

352
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,040
Well, I'd better wipe it off.

353
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,060
♫  I forgot time unconsciously  ♫

354
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,240
♫  Slowly understanding you on the long road  ♫

355
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,700
♫  Without you, even joy feels lonely  ♫

356
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,140
♫  Looking at your white shirt  ♫

357
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,300
♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

358
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:39,220
♫  The secret I've been hiding  ♫

359
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,200
♫  I really want to be with you  ♫

360
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,940
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

361
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,120
♫  The knight and princess are destined to meet  ♫

362
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,200
♫  Let me feel and guard your simple wish  ♫

363
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,220
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

364
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,360
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

365
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,440
♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

366
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,620
♫  You say every good night  ♫

367
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,340
♫  At a moment, in the autumn of a fairy tale  ♫

368
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,540
♫  The knight and princess are destined to meet  ♫

369
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:24,500
    
 ♫  Let me feel and guard your simple wish  ♫

370
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,480
♫  At a moment, in reversely flying days  ♫

371
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,660
♫  I'm no longer afraid of the big world  ♫

372
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,740
♫  By my side or on my pillow  ♫

373
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,600
♫  You say every good night  ♫

374
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,900
AAA plus 6.

375
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,550
Bomb.

376
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,780
What's going on?

377
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,340
She comes for you?

378
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,480
You finally come.

379
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,050
Will we go on?

380
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,510
Will we go on?

381
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,400
Will we go on?

382
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,830
We can go on?

383
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,270
This girl is pretty.

384
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,760
- Very pretty. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Yeah.

385
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,480
Well, you go on.

386
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,750
Okay. You go. You go.

387
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,290
You have good taste.

388
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,660
Let's go.

389
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,990
- Don't stand still. Go in. 
 - Go. Go. Go.

390
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,030
If I leave now, will you lose face?

391
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,650
You want to leave?

392
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,480
I'm thinking about it.

393
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,760
Okay, take your time.

394
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm closing the door.

395
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,750
Why are you standing there?

396
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,450
Come and take a seat.

397
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,850
Where should I sit?

398
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,450
Sit here.

399
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,390
This is a single bed.

400
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,240
I ask you to sit but not lie here.

401
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,610
You ate spicy hot pot on New Year's Eve?

402
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,210
So?

403
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,840
Where did Liu Sisi go?

404
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,440
Didn't you go home together?

405
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,140
You went through her Moments?

406
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,380
You did it so carefully.

407
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,780
I didn't.

408
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,410
We couldn't go to the station together?

409
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,800
I specially came for you.

410
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,940
Hey.

411
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,720
What?

412
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,490
You're leaving?

413
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,270
You don't want the red packet?

414
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,580
Red packet? Why do you give me a red packet?

415
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,940
I received the advance payment today,

416
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,280
so I'm here to pay for your work.

417
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,010
You'll be satisfied.

418
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,980
So thin. Stingy.

419
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,010
Open it and have a look.

420
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,140
It'll be your pay card.

421
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,420
Does it have a password?

422
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,370
My birthday.

423
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,200
Narcissist.

424
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,760
Do you like it?

425
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,030
I like this gift very much.

426
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,800
Thank you.

427
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,410
This is not a gift.

428
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,540
It's your pay.

429
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,250
This is your gift.

430
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,870
What is this?

431
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,620
Open it and have a look.

432
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,750
Try it on.

433
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,820
Where can I try it on?

434
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,750
   

435
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,510
Is anything wrong?

436
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,570
Don't hold your abdomen in.

437
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,310
You're not fat.

438
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,110
Why are you blushing?

439
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,290
I'm-I'm blushing due to the heater.

440
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,760
I didn't switch on the heater.

441
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,510
This dress looks good.

442
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,460
Princess should wear a dress.

443
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm going to wash my face.

444
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,000
 How do I give him this? 

445
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,800
How will you thank me?

446
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,860
Let's set off fireworks.

447
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,930
Okay. I'll go to buy some.

448
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,530
Well, almost done.

449
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,700
Okay.

450
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,750
How much?

451
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,810
Well, pay me 200 yuan.

452
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,320
200 yuan?

453
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,410
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

454
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,830
- Thank you. 
 - You can take them away.

455
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,100
I'm going to play cards.

456
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,850
Okay.

457
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,610
Zhu Yun.

458
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,150
I bought some.

459
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,310
What kind of fireworks do you want to see?

460
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:56,730
Those that will blow up in the air.

461
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,210
What?

462
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,690
Those that will blow up in the air.

463
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Your description is vivid.

464
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,150
Just this.

465
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,450
Wait a minute. I'm going to borrow a lighter.

466
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,100
I have one.

467
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,830
You have a lighter?

468
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,680
Catch it.

469
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,010
What a good repairer.

470
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,900
It must have been hard to restore this.

471
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,370
Just so-so.

472
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,060
Princess,

473
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,800
thank you.

474
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,200
I gave you this in return.

475
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,340
Don't mistake my meaning.

476
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,580
Are you ready?

477
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,160
♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

478
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,640
♫  And have passed through the dark night  ♫

479
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,940
♫  In the crowd in the dim light  ♫

480
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,300
♫  You're over there with the fireworks  ♫

481
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,000
♫  It's the intuition of the dream  ♫

482
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,520
♫  It breaks through the boundary  ♫

483
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,760
♫  The first glance during the first meeting  ♫

484
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,600
♫  Spreads and later it wins the world for me  ♫

485
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,120
♫  'Cause I believe I love you  ♫

486
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,180
♫  True love will take its course  ♫

487
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,710
Happy New Year.

488
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,770
Happy New Year.

489
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,280
♫  Spending such a long time with you  ♫

490
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,380
♫  Because I believe I want you  ♫

491
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,410
Happy New Year, Li Xun! Happy New Year!

492
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,780
♫  That hot firework  ♫

493
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:21,220
♫  It's always you who keeps it lit up for me  ♫

494
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,080
Eyelashes are so long.

495
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,420
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

496
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,740
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

497
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,140
♫  Nothing ever changed  ♫

498
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,700
♫  Have you ever changed?  ♫

499
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,630
♫  I don't know how you've been there  ♫

500
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,150
What do you want to do?

501
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,860
♫  You don't know how I've been there  ♫

502
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,410
Good night.

503
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,760
♫  I've been walking so long  ♫

504
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,290
   

505
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,060
 Yun Yun, get up. 

506
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,770
Why do you still lie in bed?

507
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,310
You didn't stay up late yesterday.

508
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,930
Sleepyhead, rise and shine.

509
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,420
It's a nice day.

510
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,070
Hurry up. Get up and get changed.

511
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,180
We're going to pay a New Year call.

512
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,630
   
  

513
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,910
 I'm going back to the university. See you on campus. 

514
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,870
 See you on campus. 

515
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,400
   

516
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,310
I remember you liked drinking taro milk tea in the past.

517
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,050
Thank you. But now I prefer coffee.

518
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,540
Sometimes we like pretending to be mature.

519
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,840
Brother Xiuzhu, how long can you stay this time?

520
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,340
What's up?

521
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,100
I have a long vacation.

522
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,230
I have more than a month left.

523
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,580
Are you curious about Chinese universities?

524
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,260
How about I show you around my university?

525
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,530
Our university is one of the leading key universities in China,

526
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,310
and its painting major is even very famous among art academies.

527
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,100
If you didn't go abroad, you might not have been admitted into it.

528
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,250
Don't say so.

529
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,500
I mustn't be admitted.

530
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,940
I didn't mean that.

531
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,010
It's an honor to invite such an excellent artist as you to our university.

532
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,300
You're abnormal.

533
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,080
Something must have happened.

534
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,870
Nothing.

535
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,060
How about this?

536
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,310
I'll treat you to a good meal near my university with my lucky money.

537
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,830
I smell something.

538
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,400
What?

539
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,410
A plot.

540
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,600
Just-Just do me a favor.

541
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:18,030
Okay. It's rare for you to treat me.

542
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,370
Well, when do you want to leave?

543
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,850
I'll help you.

544
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,990
Thank you for allowing Zhu Yun to go with me.

545
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,310
I'm sorry for bothering you during the Spring Festival.

546
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,640
Well, Chinese and foreign universities

547
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,920
are greatly different in both educational concepts and campus atmosphere.

548
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,800
Yun Yun can show you around Nanhu University these days.

549
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,360
It's rare for me to have a vacation.

550
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,250
I planned to stay at home for some days.

551
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,420
If I go to the university, I'll have no time to come back.

552
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,630
It's rare for Xiuzhu to come back.

553
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,550
You go with him and then preview your lessons for next semester at the university.

554
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,460
Listen. You must be self-disciplined in university,

555
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,760
or else you may not be admitted into any foreign college due to your bad grades in the future.

556
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,600
How about Brother Xiuzhu going by himself?

557
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,100
I disagree.

558
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,320
You can take this opportunity to ask him about some matters,

559
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,020
such as the channel for publishing articles.

560
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,310
Am I right?

561
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:20,260
I just want to stay with you for some days.

562
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,520
Your university is not far.

563
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,130
If I miss you, I can go and see you at any time.

564
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,320
Go.

565
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,010
I'm leaving, Mom.

566
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,310
Go.

567
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,250
Aunt, see you.

568
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,500
Drive slowly.

569
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,860
Master, you want to go but pretend to loathe the idea.

570
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,110
I learned this from you.

571
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,910
After all, you're good at pretending to be well-behaved in front of your parents.

572
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,430
Okay, I can give you a discount on tuition.

573
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,590
I really want to learn how to please my mother.

574
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,860
However, it's a gift.

575
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,830
You can't acquire it.

576
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,380
Yeah. It seems that you have a gift for pleasing my mother.

577
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,810
You two are CP, right?

578
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,330
Well, navigate for me.

579
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,720
Thank you.

580
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,760
Thank you, Brother Xiuzhu.

581
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,950
Can you find a hotel later?

582
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,340
What is this, you are asking me to leave now?

583
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,300
If I'm free tomorrow, I'll definitely show you around.

584
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,130
It's late, and you must be tired after driving me here.

585
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,970
Zhu Yun, are you sure you won't use me anymore?

586
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,670
Why don't we have something in the canteen?

587
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,640
You're back.

588
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:24,470


589
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,360
   

590
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,890
 The preliminary of Information Security Competition 

591
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,970
 will be held at the Information Technology University. 

592
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,930
 Hello, I'm Xu Lina from the Computer Science Department of this university. 

593
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,340
 I'm also a freshman. 

594
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,260
 Hello, Li Xun. 

595
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,490
 I've long heard your name. 

596
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,540
 Sorry, I'm very busy. 

597
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:49,920
 ...and Fang Zhijing, who won the Special Attention Award in this competition, to come to the stage 

598
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,880
 and press the crystal ball with us.
