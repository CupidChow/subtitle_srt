2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,716
♫  Everything is different from the sea to the sky  ♫

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,740
♫  The person I used to be has disappeared without a trace  ♫

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  I no longer believe one person can redeem another  ♫

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,340
♫  Until when you broke into my world  ♫

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,180
♫  Even if the world exploded into darkness  ♫

7
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,536
♫  We bloom in the dark  ♫

8
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:52,020
♫  The knight and the king  ♫

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100
♫  Sail at night with white sails to navigate 
 and protect the vast ocean  ♫

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,440
♫  I can see a clear direction  ♫

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,340
♫  In which a touch of golden color flickers 
 at the end of the wheat field  ♫

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,060
♫  Even if I am the king  ♫

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
♫  With supreme glory everything would be meaningless without you  ♫

14
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,700
♫  Going through fire and water is to make you remember  ♫

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,620
♫  The way everything was at the beginning  ♫

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,140
♫  If I am the king  ♫

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,880
♫  Who is as arrogant as the fierce wind and wild grass  ♫

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,580
♫  I only want you to be at my side, whatever it takes  ♫

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,784
♫  And everything is the way it used to be at the very beginning  ♫

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,980
   

21
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,860
   

22
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,390
Li Xun,

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,340
thank you for helping me today.

24
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,730
I'll wait for you at Wenshan Lake at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

25
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,580
Do come. I have something to tell you.

26
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,030
You're really going?

27
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,820
Go back to rest. You've been busy the whole day.

28
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,350
Why didn't you refuse her?

29
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,690
Did she give me the time to refuse her?

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
Let's go.

31
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,360
 Well done, Li Xun. You're so cool. 

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,370
 I love you, Li Xun. 

33
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,178
 You're so cool. 

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,536
 Thank you for helping me today. 

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,410
 I'll wait for you at Wenshan Lake at 10:00 tomorrow morning. 

36
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,400
 Do come. I have something to tell you. 

37
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,030
 Hello. 

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,320
Help me, Ren Di.

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,212
You were robbed?

40
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:12,510
No.

41
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,740
Is it about Li Xun? Go ahead.

42
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,300
How did you know that?

43
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,230
 Well, isn't it about him? 

44
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,228
Yes.

45
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,020
 Tell me. 

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,468
Another girl likes him?

47
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,940
What kind of girl is she?

48
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,020
She is a good-looking girl.

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,348
What do you think now?

50
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,450
Ren Di, I want to ask you a question.

51
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,940
If I confess initiatively, will I be looked down upon?

52
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,270
Li Xun always looks down upon others whether you take the initiative or not.

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,920
 It's difficult for you. 

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,320
Who is more beautiful, that girl or Liu Sisi?

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,100
Both are beautiful.

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,680
 Come on. You stay with Li Xun every day. 

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,590
 How can other girls get a chance to get close to him? 

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,740
I was too busy to pay attention to that these days.

59
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,400
Here is my advice.

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,696
Strike first to gain the advantage, or you'll always be single.

61
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:13,290
But what if I confess first and am declined?

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,500
 Then I will advise you again. 

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Men are like canteen food.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,650
Though the food doesn't look delicious, it will be sold out if you're late.

65
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,600
But I don't think Xu Lina is his type.

66
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,740
 If you know what his type is, why bother calling me, the national emotional hotline, now? 

67
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,468
Don't flatter yourself.

68
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:36,620
 Li Xun looks free and easy, but he won't accept others easily. 

69
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,018
 Emotions are his weakness. 

70
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:40,620
 So you have to make up your mind. 

71
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,964
 Don't betray him once you confess. 

72
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:47,280
Ren Di, do me a favor.

73
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,230
Well, what kind of hairstyle do you want?

74
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,340
- Try all of them. 
 - Okay.

75
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,670
Do you think it looks good?

76
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,280
I think with this hairstyle, you can just put on a wedding dress and go to the church.

77
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,192
You're so late.

78
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:51,180
I went to fetch it right after my performance.

79
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,640
It's Xu Lina's fault. No one will confess in the morning.

80
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,270
Hurry up.

81
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,650
Come on. Go.

82
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,834
- Do you think he and I... 
 -  A perfect match.

83
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,910
Sorry. Sorry. Let me take the taxi first. I'm in a hurry.

84
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,570
Sir, please drive me to the north gate of Information and Technology University.

85
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

86
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,060
Miss, how can you do that?

87
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,940
You're so rude.

88
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,740
Sir, I'll get off here.

89
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,940
Okay.

90
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,980
♫  I craved for your tenderness, when you looked back that night  ♫

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,600
♫  Let me be the one at the crossroad, it turns out I'm no match for you  ♫

 Oh no. He left with Xu Lina. 

108

 Why didn't he wait for me? 

109
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,040

What are you going to do with me?

122
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,490
Li Xun, choose me.

I'll never betray you.

124
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,230
Hug you?

125
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,020
Will it kill you if you hug me?

126
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,570
I will.

127
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,278
When are you going to tell me about Liu Xiaoyan?

128
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,540
Anyway, you'll know.

What are you smiling at?

139
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,060
Hypocritical.

140
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,104
Who is hypocritical?

141
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,210
- Who is hypocritical? 
 - Who is hypocritical?

142
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,560
- Who? 
 - Who?

143
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,940
 I have my king... 

144
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,060
 and I'm his vassal. 

145
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,902
 I am willing to wave the flag and shout for him, and I am willing to fight and die for him. 

146
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,452
   

147

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,520
I understand your feelings very much.

150
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,068
But the waiver is over.

151
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,700
Yes.

152
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,334
Chen Tao is an excellent kid.

153
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:55,130
I believe with his own efforts, he can also be admitted to the Graduate School.

154
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,660
Bye.

155
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,760
Miss, what can I do for you?

156
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,540
Have you read the list of recommended students publicized downstairs?

157
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,140
Not yet.

158
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,740
Why-Why is there no Fang Shumiao on the list?

159
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,400
Hello, Miaomiao. Where are you?

160
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,680
 I'll talk with you later. I'm dealing with a murder case at the hospital. 

161
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,626
Murder case?

162
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,760
Wu Mengxing, how great you are!

163
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,810
We're going to graduate, but you are getting punished.

164
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,750
I don't think you need to take the postgraduate exam.

165
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,991
What a coward! He even reported such a thing.

166
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,000
You aren't a coward, but you were badly hit.

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,060
I can't understand. Did I ask you to help me?

168
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,790
I couldn't bear watching it. He was bullying you.

169
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,386
That paper was clearly written by you.

170
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,840
Now we're both involved. Are you happy now?

171
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,462
 Wu Mengxing, please go to the second window to pick up your medicine. 

172
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,580
There are drugs for external use and oral administration. Go back and take them.

173
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,530
Are-Are you leaving?

174
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,310
Otherwise? You can walk by yourself.

175
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,540
You want me to send you back?

176
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,430
She hasn't come in yet?

177
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,130
She is on the phone.

178
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,178
- What happened? 
 - It smells delicious.

179
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:51,490
I dumped that jerk. He just took my name off the paper we wrote together.

180
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,460
Was it necessary? He should list you as the second author, at least.

181
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,830
He did it on purpose.

182
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,218
He dated me because I'm a local.

183
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,260
But he got nothing from me.

184
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,040
He should nurse a grievance.

185
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,250
You're hardheaded.

186
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,442
Zhang Zhicheng, are you a man?

187
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,930
You take your undeserved gain for granted. You're going too far.

188
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,260
Listen.

189
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,510
Go to the students' affairs division tomorrow morning and cancel Wu Mengxing's punishment.

190
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,840
There's a world of difference between men.

191
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,970
Fang Shumiao's fell in love and it became a stumbling block on her studies.

192
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,298
However, Zhu Yun and her boyfriend are making progress together.

193
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,280
When will you and Li Xun take the postgraduate exams?

194
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,900
Tomorrow.

195
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,580
Go for it.

196
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,020
Enjoy the food.

197
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,330
Enjoy the food. I'm hungry.

198
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,930
There are eggs.

199
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,200
   

200
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,870
   

201
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,550
Hello, Ren Di.

202
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,490
 Have you finished your exam? Tell Li Xun the room is settled. 

203
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,240
 I paid for him first. 

204
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,788
What room?

205
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,586
 An office. 

206
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,210
He wants to rent an office?

207
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,630
 Yeah, he's starting a company. Didn't you know? 

208
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,810
Hello.

209
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,350
Why didn't you take the exam?

210
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,582
Is it today?

211
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:37,340
You don't plan to take postgraduate studies, right?

212
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,860
I didn't say I'd go to Graduate School.

213
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,280
I'm going to suspend school and start a business.

214
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,340
What are you going to do after graduation?

215
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,060
Set up a company.

216
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,640
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,750
Nothing tangible is yet in sight. What can I tell you?

218
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,084
You've even found an office.

219
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,180
Ren Di knows that you want to rent an office.

220
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,070
I'm the only one in the world who doesn't know. Isn't it ridiculous?

221
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,750
Is this the so-called eye of the storm?

222
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,860
I wanted to tell you after it was all set up.

223
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,900
Inform me after it's all set up?

224
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,720
What do you think? Did you ask me?

225
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,381
Have you ever wondered what my mother will do if I give up postgraduate studies

226
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,580
and start a business with you?

227
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,420
- What will she do? 
 - She'll kill me.

228
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,606
Did you include me in your plan?

229
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,700
Li Xun, I always think I'm close to you, but I still can't understand you.

230
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,290
I hear everything about you from others.

231
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,870
I feel like I'm doing a jigsaw puzzle.

232
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,806
I'm your girlfriend.

233
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:02,590
I want a place in your future. Is that unreasonable?

234
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,590
I don't want to talk to you.

235
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,750
Zhu Yun.

236
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,690
Zhu Yun.

237
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,962
How unfortunate!

238
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,034
I met the wrong person.

239
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:29,510
My whole life is destroyed, Zhu Yun.

240
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,870
You said you'd wave your flag for me

241
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,830
What? Now, are you going to abandon the king?

242
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,960
Don't play jokes with me.

243
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,560
Can you not follow me?

244
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,921
♫  As long as you're by my side  ♫

245
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,692
♫  I forgot time unconsciously  ♫

246
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,720
You'll take oral test later, right?

247
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,660
It's none of your business.

248
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,330
Dine with me after the test.

249
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,890
I have no time.

250
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,972
♫  I feel full warmth and endless love  ♫

251
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,940
Does your back hurt again?

252
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,410
I'll pick you up after the exam.

253
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,240
What are you doing?

254
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,910
- Have a big dinner. 
 -  I have no time.

255
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,760
- You must eat. 
 - I have no appetite.

256
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,380
- You must eat. 
 - No.

257
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,570
- Eat. 
 - No.

258
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,030
Play rock-paper-scissors. The loser shall drive the other one back.

259
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,440
Rock-paper-scissors!

260
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,940
- You can walk. 
 - Take me.

261
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,720
Come on, let's go.

262
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,270
Run. Run.

263
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,420
Can you stop following me?

264
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,380
   

265
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,980
Be careful.

266
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,364
Hold onto me.

267
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,390
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

268
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,420
Stop.

269
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,380
Reach out.

270
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,840
Press it.

271
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,880
Are you ready?

272
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,820
- Really? 
 - Yes.

273
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,244
You brought me here for dinner?

274
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:24,390
This is our new company.

275
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,280
New company.

276
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,350
Really?

277
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,950
Yes.

278
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,934
To make you the first one to see the new company,

279
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,010
I moved all the furniture in myself.

280
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,878
I think you just don't want to pay.

281
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
Now the company is founded.

282
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,496
Each expenditure shall be approved by all shareholders.

283
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,386
Who is the other shareholder?

284
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:53,250
I won't say who the other shareholder is.

285
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,820
Anyway, she is a strong shareholder.

286
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,008
Like me, she holds 50% of the shares.

287
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,350
I have no money.

288
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,240
I can only invest technologically.

289
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,188
Miser.

290
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,580
How can you be so flirtatious?

291
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,200
You just started renting such a big place for a new company.

292
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,298
Come back.

293
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,690
Out there belongs to some other companies.

294
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,110
This is a shared office.

295
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,890
Only this room belongs to our company.

296
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,670
Stingy.

297
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,880
I have a question.

298
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,098
Can you install furniture?

299
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,176
You're cruel. You always exploit me.

300
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:40,450
Over there is shared storage.

301
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,218
Fetch the tool box for me.

302
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,350
Go.

303
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,740
Don't disturb the staff of the other companies.

304
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,400
Turn right.

305
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,650
What's this?

306
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,150
This is L&amp;P.

307
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,140
I'm asking you the meaning of these two letters?

308
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:53,480
This is the name I gave the company.

309
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,892
Did you ask the shareholders before giving the name?

310
00:23:58,892 --> 00:24:01,340
The name is meaningful.

311
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,890
What is it?

312
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,758
Lucky &amp; Power.

313
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:07,970
L&amp;P.

314
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,730
Come on. 
    

315
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,140
Isn't it Lighter and Princess?

316
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,390
Lighter and what?

317
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,110
Princess.

318
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,614
Tell me what it means?

319
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:21,498
Lighter and Princess.

320
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,720
I see. That's what you think.

321
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,734
Isn't it?

322
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:37,730
Princess, don't be so narcissistic. Right?

323
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,380
Listen to me for such an important thing.

324
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,200
I'll be responsible for the name of our company and all external explanations.

325
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,560
We'll do what you say?

326
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,350
Why?

327
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,010
I also hold half of the shares.

328
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,440
I have an objection to the ownership structure.

329
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,820
Now that we each hold 50% of the shares.

330
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,512
Who will decide if we don't agree with each other?

331
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,450
What do you want to do?

332
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,010
- We must... 
 - What do you want to do?

333
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,900
What do you want to do?

334
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,551
What do you want to do?

335
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:17,280
- What do you want to do, Zhu Yun? 
 - I don't want anything.

336
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,080
What do you want to do?

337
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,820
Do you give up? Do you give up?

338
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,140
- Yes. 
 - Say yes.

339
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,420
Yes.

340
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,920
Then claim your shares.

341
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,430
- Okay. 
 - Will you claim them or not?

342
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,510
- Will you? 
 - Yes.

343
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,190
How many shares?

344
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,054
50%.

345
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,340
- Who will decide? 
 - I will.

346
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,830
- Who will decide? 
 - I will. 
 - Repeat it.

347
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,850
- I will. 
 - Who will decide? 
 - I will.

348
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,590
- Who will decide? 
 - I will.

349
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,080
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Zhu Yun.

350
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,960
Really?

351
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,560
Who are you?

352
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,400
   

353
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,048
What about my studies?

354
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,400
You can continue to study or go to work.

355
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,706
If you want to study abroad, I'll stay here and wait for you.

356
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,628
Do whatever you want.

357
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,752
I'll support you.

358
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,130
Li Xun, I want to start a business with you.

359
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,362
Let's start with L &amp; P.

360
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,350
   

361
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,200
   

362
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,446
 He isn't a student of our university. 

363
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:09,550
 But his shape is like that of Li Xun. 

364
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,080
Hey, Student.

365
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,678
 Not at all. 

366
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,680
Do you have time?

367
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,660
I want to ask you something.

368
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,670
No.

369
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,200
Hey, Student.

370
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,220
I want to ask you about someone.

371
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,350
Who?

372
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,266
Is there a blond boy here?

373
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,870
There are many blond boys in our school.

374
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,006
Which one do you mean?

375
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,730
The one with the blondest hair.

376
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,430
 Are you ordering? 

377
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,248
The most handsome and best guy.

378
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:53,092
Is he Li Xun?

379
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:56,200
- You're clever. 
 - Well, follow me.

380
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,630
Xun!

381
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,938
Brother came to see you.

382
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:09,060
Why are you here?

383
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,390
Where is your blonde hair?

384
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,690
Where is your blonde hair?

385
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,820
What are you doing here?

386
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,210
I'm fine.

387
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,680
I came to see you.

388
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,128
Why did you dye your hair black?

389
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,941
- None of your business. 
 - I'm really not used to it.

390
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,072
Great.

391
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,442
It looks plausible.

392
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,240
Do you want to have some water?

393
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,760
Thank you.

394
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,136
Are you younger brother's wife?

395
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,900
Just say hello.

396
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,880
Wanting to hold hands...

397
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,186
Come on. Sit down.

398
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,820
Are you really his brother?

399
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,150
Of course.

400
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,630
Why isn't your surname Li?

401
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,250
Cousins?

402
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,340
If you don't mind, you can call me Li Yizhuo.

403
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,020
Don't talk to a fool or you'll become a fool.

404
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,940
I'm not a fool.

405
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,730
We haven't met each other for a long time.

406
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,000
Can't I come to see you?

407
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
- No. 
 - Why not?

408
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,550
Why don't we go out to eat?

409
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,950
I'm not hungry.

410
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,810
I can't eat as I like.

411
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,510
Why?

412
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,568
Do you know what I do?

413
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,010
Can't you tell from my outfit?

414
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,218
Opera singer?

415
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,530
Come on.

416
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,440
I have to show you something.

417
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,388
Watch!

418
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,774
5, 6, 7, 8.

419
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,310
1, 2, 3, 4.

420
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,790
 For the first time in my life, I feel that I have a small vocabulary. 

421
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,988
Okay.

422
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,040
Stop.

423
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,860
What's wrong with you?

424
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,290
Can you tell?

425
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,836
You know that I'm a dancer,

426
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,790
so I can't eat as I like.

427
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,520
Forget it. You aren't a dancer.

428
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,620
You keep practicing the same things.

429
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,620
No wonder your dad said you're wasting time.

430
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,240
Why can't you spit ivory out of your dog's mouth? 
  (Idiom meaning, "Can't you say nice things?") 

431
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,690
I dance well.

432
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,098
 These two are really brothers. 

433
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,680
What do you think?

434
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,040
Great.

435
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,700
How great?

436
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,670
You're in good shape.

437
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,620
How tall are you?

438
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,871
Only 185 cm.

439
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:11,091
Stop talking with him.

440
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:13,066
He's a Latin dancer.

441
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,420
He's a bad dancer without a partner.

442
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,820
You're still solo now?

443
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,760
A bad dancer?

444
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,320
Am I a bad dancer? I'm an experienced Latin dancer.

445
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,490
- You haven't seen my progress recently. 
 - What are you doing here?

446
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,420
I came to you for something.

447
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,320
No way.

448
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,420
Think about it.

449
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,800
No, even if I think about it again and again.

450
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,960
Xun, I'm doing it for you.

451
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,660
Fu Yizhuo,

452
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,200
we haven't contacted each other since we were expelled from school.

453
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,980
Do you understand?

454
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,850
Go.

455
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,060
I won't go.

456
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,250
If you don't, I will.

457
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,860
Let's go.

458
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,200
Where are we going?

459
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,680
Close the door when you leave.

460
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,790
- What's going on? 
 - Nothing.

461
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,530
What he wants to tell you, if you don't listen, you won't answer.

462
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,520
Trivia.

463
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,350
- What's the connection between you and his family? 
 - We have no connection.

464
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,040
Why did he come to you?

465
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,540
Let's go.

466
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
What's wrong?

467
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,206
Why did you stop?

468
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:49,490
You are hiding everything from me again.

469
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,140
Li Xun, you're not alone now.

470
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,660
We need to talk with each other.

471
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,010
I see.

472
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,430
Let's go.

473
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,550
Where?

474
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,960
To communicate.  To communicate slowly at home.

475
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,580
But you left him in the office.

476
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,320
Just let him stay there.

477
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,110
We need someone to dispel the smell in the new office.

478
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,110
He is the right one.

479
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,180
What did Fu Yizhuo want to talk about with you?

480
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,044
What can we talk about?

481
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:35,270
His father wants to enter in the technology industry and wants to invest in our company.

482
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,118
That's great. Why don't you agree?

483
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,620
Princess,

484
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,262
do you know where my favorite place about you is?

485
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,910
Where?

486
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,564
Can we have a good chat?

487
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:05,200
What I like most about you is that you'll never figure out what you're thinking.

488
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,608
Tell me why is that.

489
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:10,090
Look.

490
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,390
You want go straight in everything.

491
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,690
One is one, two is two. It's like signing a contract with someone else.

492
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,830
But you know what, there are really very few people who do things according to the contract.

493
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,874
You're quite similar to Fu Yizhuo.

494
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,370
- We look alike? 
 - Spitting image.

495
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,780
We were more similar to each other when we were little boys.

496
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:37,216
I made my first big income from him.

497
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:44,150
I was in my third year of high school and he had a very important exam, I went for him.

498
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,170
I got full score for all subjects.

499
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,790
- He gave me 1,000 yuan. 
  - That much?

500
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,360
Unfortunately, we were caught due to a lack of experience.

501
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:58,364
His dad threatened him during the high school exam, saying that if he didn't get his diploma,

502
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:00,580
he wouldn't dance in the future.

503
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,080
You know what happened later.

504
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,520
Because of the accident, I was on familiar terms with your mom.

505
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,980
That was the first time I saw you.

506
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,440
Through your window,

507
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,592
I saw a lot of balloons and streamers hanging in the room.

508
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,956
Everyone talked and laughed.

509
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,158
You cut the cake in the center.

510
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,660
It was like a fairy tale world.

511
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,914
Fu Yizhuo's father started out as a steel worker.

512
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:05,980
The business was doing quite well.

513
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,070
But he should also be able to see that the physical industry will become more and more difficult in the next few years.

514
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,418
Maybe he wanted to make some preparations in advance.

515
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:17,680
I heard that he poached many elites in the Internet technology industry,

516
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,490
but he doesn't know anything about the industry.

517
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,610
Why does he want to meet you?

518
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,130
He said he wanted to make an investment.

519
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,554
Actually, he wants an expert under his control to work for him.

520
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,970
Then you'd better not go.

521
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,430
You're lovely.

522
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,840
Are you still angry?

523
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,420
It was a waste of time for me to talk so much.

524
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,500
It was not a waste of time. We're communicating.

525
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,332
Communication?

526
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,540
I won't send you back. I'm going out tonight.

527
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,970
What are you going to do?

528
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,000
To arrange everything for that fool.

529
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,860
I don't think he is clever enough to do it or can take care of himself.

530
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,540
What's wrong?

531
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,440
You said we should communicate.

532
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,272
Why do you cherish words like gold when it's your turn?

533
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,320
I found a rule.

534
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,420
What is it?

535
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,628
Someone is so nice to those who call him younger brother.

536
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,008
I also found a rule.

537
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:47,670
What is it?

538
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,910
I can be nicer to those who call me elder brother.

539
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,050
- Call me brother. 
 - No.

540
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,070
- Come on. 
 - No.

541
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,920
- Call me brother. 
 - No.

542
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,590
Will you? Will you?

543
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,630
 Fu Yizhuo fought fiercely with his dad. 

544
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,578
 He wanted to dance, 

545
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,520
 but his dad didn't think he could make it. 

546
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,398
 Fu Yizhuo had no friends except me. 

547
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,260
 - Great. 
 - Good job. 

548
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,590
Hi, little sister.

549
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,570
Come on.

550
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,310
My name is Zhu Yun. Deficient you can figure it out

551
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,910
and stuff your phone number in my bag.

552
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,410
Thanks.

553
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,488
Only you can convince Li Xun.

554
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,246
I have no choice, so I have to turn to you for help.

555
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,130
I just saw you dancing there. You looked like what Li Xun said.

556
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,644
Like what? A telephone pole.

557
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,650
Never mind. I'm used to it.

558
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:49,190
He came to see me yesterday and told me a lot about you two.

559
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,570
Like what?

560
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,100
He said you pursued him with great effort.

561
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,320
At first, he didn't even think about it.

562
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,960
However, you threw yourself at him.

563
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,416
He couldn't drive you away no matter what, so he reluctantly agreed.

564
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:10,872
It's like a dog can't spit out ivory.

565
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:13,172
Although it's not as exaggerated as I said,

566
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:17,838
I can probably guess how he spoke about me to you.

567
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,680
Like telling stories, he tells only the outline but never the details,

568
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,622
because he never shows weakness, especially in front of those who he cares about.

569
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,070
But why do you always call him Xun?

570
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,750
Is this a special nickname between you two?

571
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,630
Did he tell you something about him and me?

572
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,360
Which aspect do you mean?

573
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,660
- Little Sister... 
 - My name is Zhu Yun.

574
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,010
Do you want to know exactly how he and I met?

575
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,010
Little Li Xun was co cute.

576
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,900
How did you two meet?

577
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,352
Promise me one condition.

578
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,860
Then you'd better not say anything.

579
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,520
Who knows what you say is true or false.

580
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,358
What I say will be true.

581
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,250
Who can testify for you?

582
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,246
My sincerity extends as far as my heart goes.

583
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:10,630
 Li Xun is right. 

584
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,558
 You're really a fool. 

585
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:17,340
Okay. I trust you, otherwise I wouldn't be here.

586
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,130
How did he tell you about the process of our acquaintance?

587
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,230
An accident.

588
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,570
Nice one, by accident...

589
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,070
Thankfully he can speak.

590
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,266
I think it was more or less a deliberate plan.

591
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,544
Back then we were students at the best high school in the city.

592
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:41,860
But I didn't like school.

593
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,170
I always skipped class in the first year of senior high school.

594
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,578
I met him once.

595
00:41:46,578 --> 00:41:49,500
 Come on. 1, 2. 

596
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,640
 I-I-I... 

597
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,040
 - Let's go. 
 - Wait. 

598
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,590
 Our schoolbags. 

599
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,900
 - Go fetch them. 
 - Leave them there. 
 - My homework is in the schoolbag. 

600
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,820
 - Now that you skip class, why bother caring about your homework? 
 - Go fetch them down there. 

601
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,570
 Your homework? 

602
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,570
 I can do it for you. 

603
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,270
 - 20 yuan a subject. 
 - It's too expensive. 

604
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,240
 It's too expensive? 

605
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,290
 50 yuan a subject and a review. What do you think? 

606
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,280
 - Deal. 
 - I have no money. 

607
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,140
 I'll pay for you. 

608
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,700
 Classmate, what are you doing? 

609
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,450
 - Which class are you in? 
 - Nothing. I was just taking a stroll. 

610
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,380
Later, he always did my homework for me to earn money.

611
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,360
He seemed to always be short of money in high school.

612
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,890
Later, I learned that his mother was terminally ill.

613
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:06,650


614
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,210
   

615

♫  I have passed through the world  ♫

616
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,550
 Happy New Year!

  Happy New Year! 

618
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,650
 I decided to go abroad. 

619
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,840
 I went to find Xu Lina. 

620
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,440
 Lina, will you give me a chance? 

621
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,462
 She said she likes you.
