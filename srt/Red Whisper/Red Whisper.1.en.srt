1
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,847
You always look prettier when I'm busy

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,100
Really? Aren't you always pretty?

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,145
Yeah, what should we do about that?

4
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,106
About what?

5
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,818
I wish you were beautiful only to my eyes

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,324
It's true, you're only beautiful to my eyes

7
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,994
Because only you know my true self

8
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,329
Yes, only I will know

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,263
Ajin, you got a text

10
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,431
It's okay

11
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,433
Isn't it from work?

12
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,394
Yes, it's from work

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,146
The team leader...

14
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,690
It's the weekend, he should give us a break

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,651
Does he always contact you like this on weekends?

16
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,490
That's what happens when you do your job well

17
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,160
Do you have to go again?

18
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,369
Yeah...

19
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,121
I have a presentation on Monday

20
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,748
He says there's missing information

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
I have to go

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,132
I'll be back soon

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,217
Okay

24
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,611
Oh, Harry

25
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,863
Yes?

26
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,740
I'm at home

27
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,664
What brings you to this neighborhood?

28
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,624
Ah, I was in the area

29
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,750
And I thought of you, sis

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,253
Oh? Have you been thinking about me a lot lately?

31
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,213
Hmm... Is that so?

32
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,049
Last time you came with chicken too

33
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,759
You said you bought it because you thought of me

34
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,053
Ah...

35
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:17,887
That's right

36
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,267
Wait a moment

37
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,977
Yes?

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,771
Your eyelashes

39
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,314
Huh? Where?

40
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,578
What's wrong?

41
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,585
You're... too close

42
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,130
Ah...

43
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,132
Sorry

44
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,014
It's delicious

45
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,434
Aren't you dating anyone?

46
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,144
Why suddenly?

47
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,646
No... it's just that we've known each other from our hometown

48
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,648
It's been 10 years now

49
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,318
And I don't think I've ever heard you talk about dating

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,654
That's true

51
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,365
What's up?

52
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,825
Do you have someone hidden away somewhere?

53
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,870
There's nothing to hide if there's nothing

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,875
It's strange

55
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,254
You're so pretty and kind, why don't you have a partner?

56
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,432
How are things with sister Ajin?

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,184
Ajin?

58
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,144
We're doing well

59
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,395
Is she treating you well?

60
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,688
Huh?

61
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,566
No...

62
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,443
Before, when you two fought

63
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,779
You used to call me and all that

64
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,698
But lately it seems like you don't fight at all

65
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,784
Ah...

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,411
She treats me well

67
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,914
It's just that we've been a bit busy lately

68
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,249
She just left for work

69
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,834
Huh? On the weekend?

70
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,839
It seems the team leader calls her every weekend

71
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,384
She was here until a little while ago and then left

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,761
Ah, in these times

73
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,222
That there are companies that call their employees on weekends

74
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,932
It's really bad, isn't it?

75
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,820
So this is what you've been working on lately, sis

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,154
Yes

77
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,075
As always, what you design...

78
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,996
Hmm... how to say it?

79
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,000
It's warm, like you, sis

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,584
Really?

81
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,212
That's the first time I've heard something like that

82
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,425
The colors and lines are warm and cozy, aren't they?

83
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,720
Wow, I'm embarrassed

84
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,097
Don't look at it so closely

85
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,391
Wait a moment

86
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,772
You don't wear gloves when you wash dishes, do you?

87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,068
You should apply hand cream even in summer

88
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:24,240
Even if you wash your hands frequently, apply it whenever you remember

89
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,331
It smells good, doesn't it?

90
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,890
Aren't you hungry? Do you want to eat?

91
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:49,891
Huh?

92
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,517
Let's go out to eat

93
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,520
No, it's okay

94
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,606
I'm going to go

95
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,982
You finish what you were doing too, sis

96
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,567
You're leaving already?

97
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,277
I'll come again

98
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,906
Okay, go carefully

99
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,050
Did you wait long?

100
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,637
You're here? I didn't wait long

101
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,789
Do you know why I like you?

102
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,958
Why do you like me?

103
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,128
I like that you feel it well

104
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,796
Ah, what's this!

105
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,404
Are you leaving already?

106
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,031
Yeah, I have to go.

107
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,577
Aren't you going to do it one more time?

108
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,789
You're subtly provoking me.

109
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,212
I thought you'd at least ask me to eat...

110
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,964
I'm disappointed.

111
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,632
You know.

112
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,633
I have to go.

113
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:57,977
Hello?

114
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,729
Is it the company?

115
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,025
Yeah, it's the company. I just finished up.

116
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,069
Have you eaten lunch?

117
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,613
No, not yet...

118
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,781
Did you eat before working?

119
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,325
No, I haven't either...

120
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,161
Then when I get there, let's eat together.

121
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,454
What should I bring?

122
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,584
Who are you with?

123
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
Ah, it's the team leader.

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,797
Then when I get there, let's go eat something delicious.

125
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,009
Come slowly.

126
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,303
Don't rush and fall.

127
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,390
Okay, I'll text you again when I leave.

128
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,852
Ah!

129
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,605
You find this fun?

130
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,523
Yes.

131
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,440
It's fun.

132
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,902
Have you forgotten what the condition was

133
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,570
for us to meet?

134
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,614
Condition?

135
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,410
Not interfering with other relationships.

136
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,956
Ah... that condition?

137
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,167
But you're with me right now,

138
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,418
how have I interfered?

139
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,345
Don't get angry.

140
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,973
I'm being careful too.

141
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,099
Huh?

142
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,810
Don't do that again.

143
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,428
Hello.

144
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,846
Oh, hi?

145
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,222
What brings you here?

146
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,767
I have something for Sister Soyul.

147
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,230
You came all the way to the house just to give her something?

148
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,858
Yes, and also to see her face.

149
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,612
How devoted.

150
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:13,946
What?

151
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,615
Nothing...

152
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,200
It's admirable how much you think of Soyul.

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,536
You contact her quite often, don't you?

154
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,039
It seems like you call frequently too.

155
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,249
What does that have to do with you?

156
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,251
It has everything to do with me.

157
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,295
Because Soyul is my girlfriend.

158
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,056
I appreciate your affection for Soyul,

159
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,058
but keep it in check.

160
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:42,975
Okay.

161
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,147
If you hurt Sister Soyul,

162
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,524
I won't stay quiet.

163
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,695
What are you going to do if I do stay quiet?

164
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,238
Are you going to hit me or something?

165
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,324
No.

166
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,409
I'll have to seize the opportunity.

167
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,913
Opportunity?

168
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,041
The opportunity to win Sister Soyul.

169
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,487
Ajin.

170
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:37,613
Yes?

171
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,703
Do you have any secrets from me?

172
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,746
Secrets?

173
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:46,789
Yes.

174
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,210
Secrets...

175
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,004
I do have one.

176
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,049
What is it?

177
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,470
If I tell you, it won't be a secret anymore.

178
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,183
Alright.

179
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,144
Actually...

180
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:13,941
I don't like books.

181
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,864
But we met at the book club.

182
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,615
That's right.

183
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,576
I was just pretending to read.

184
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,370
You said you liked intellectual people.

185
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,748
Really?

186
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
You said your dream was

187
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,170
to share the same hobby with the person you like.

188
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,547
So I'm trying.

189
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,133
Though as I read, I'm starting to enjoy it.

190
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,261
I really didn't know.

191
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,721
That you didn't like books...

192
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,643
Don't lie to me.

193
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,770
Not to me...

194
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,980
Okay.

195
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,608
What about you?

196
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,109
Me?

197
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,653
Don't you have any secrets?

198
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,405
Me?

199
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,784
No, I don't.

200
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,202
Really?

201
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,995
Are you completely honest with me?

202
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,079
Yes.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,918
I love you.

204
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,088
I love you.

205
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:39,109
You're really not hiding anything?

206
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,028
Well...

207
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,114
The only one who knows my true self

208
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,116
is you.

209
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,939
Yes, I've double-checked all the materials

210
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,691
I sent everything without missing anything

211
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,316
Yes

212
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,861
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow

213
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,538
Now I can finally breathe easy

214
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,914
Are you done?

215
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,791
What kind of company is this

216
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,459
To have so many projects?

217
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,879
Not even getting to rest for a week

218
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,422
Not being able to go on a date with you

219
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,424
I'm sorry

220
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,301
No, it's okay

221
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,261
I'm just happy to be here with you like this

222
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,053
I

223
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,764
Say something nice

224
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,643
Oh, right

225
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,437
I saw Harry in front of the house yesterday

226
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,234
He came by briefly yesterday to bring me coffee

227
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,614
He must have known we were both here

228
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,782
Huh?

229
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,369
It kind of bothers me, you know

230
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,167
Harry and I have known each other for over 10 years

231
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,919
Don't worry about that

232
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,881
I'm jealous

233
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,759
What do you mean, jealous?

234
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,511
Don't you get jealous?

235
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:30,763
Huh?

236
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,391
If I'm close with someone else

237
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,976
Don't you get jealous?

238
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,441
Well, I guess it depends on how close, doesn't it?

239
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,445
I can't tell if you're cool or just dense

240
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,655
Don't you get it?

241
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:51,992
Huh?

242
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,329
How did we end up meeting here?

243
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,374
Uh... yeah

244
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,502
But who is it?

245
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,548
Ah... Is that the pretty friend?

246
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,425
Soyul

247
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,219
Soyul, this is my college classmate

248
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,973
Hello

249
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,475
I've heard a lot about you

250
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,519
About me?

251
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,396
Oh yes

252
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,231
He only talks about Soyul

253
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,817
Sometimes I feel left out

254
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,321
When did I ever do that?

255
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,365
Hey, you don't do that to Soyul, do you?

256
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,035
He was really fierce in college

257
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,954
Even the seniors were afraid

258
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,122
They couldn't even approach him

259
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
What do you mean, afraid?

260
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,750
They probably avoided you because you were rude

261
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,002
That's true too

262
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,592
Hey...

263
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,970
Buy your own and drink it

264
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,306
So stingy

265
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,059
Then I'll go buy coffee

266
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,946
In college

267
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,032
He was famous for three things, you know?

268
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,034
Do you know what they are?

269
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,997
I think I heard he was top of the class

270
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,541
That's right

271
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,376
Then what are the other two?

272
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,840
I think I also heard he was very popular

273
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,386
You almost know everything

274
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,679
Then do you know what the last one is?

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,765
Are you really going to tell that story again?

276
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,644
I'm not sure, what is it?

277
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,855
Well...

278
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,689
He was a heavy drinker

279
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,318
Really?

280
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,071
He hardly drinks with me

281
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
No, I pretty much quit after graduating

282
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,242
Really?

283
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,078
No wonder you always miss

284
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,662
the class reunions

285
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,207
So...

286
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,334
You don't know what he's like when he's drunk?

287
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,129
No, I don't think I've ever seen it

288
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,507
What's he like?

289
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,135
Well

290
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,221
Oh, stop it already

291
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,057
He's very...

292
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,476
Cute

293
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,064
After seeing him drunk

294
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,816
So many girls fell for him

295
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,359
He's very cute

296
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,069
Ah, what are you saying?

297
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,746
I think I should get going

298
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,832
Yeah, please leave already

299
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,292
You're leaving already?

300
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,086
If I stay here any longer

301
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,879
He's going to kill me

302
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,468
I'm going to smoke before I go, come out for a bit

303
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,804
Ah, why are you being so annoying?

304
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,181
I'll go by myself

305
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,308
It was nice to meet you

306
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,726
See you next time

307
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,061
Yes

308
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,612
Soyul, I'm sorry

309
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,947
It was chaotic, wasn't it?

310
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,618
I...

311
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,912
I think I'm jealous

312
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,749
So Soyul gets jealous too?

313
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,043
You know I love you, right?

314
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
Just wait a little

315
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,593
I'll be right back

316
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,261
Okay

317
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,576
You're done smoking already?

318
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,410
Yeah

319
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,370
You don't like the smell of cigarettes, right?

320
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,956
Knowing that, you still ask me to come out?

321
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,086
Hey, someone might see!

322
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,215
Isn't it enough if your girlfriend doesn't know?

323
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,592
Ah, move away a bit

324
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,093
What if someone sees us?

325
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,514
I'm actually a bit jealous

326
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
Ah, hey!

327
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,345
I'm leaving now

328
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,638
Keep sleeping

329
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,841
Aren't you going to have coffee?

330
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:41,717
Are you awake?

331
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,095
Did I wake you up?

332
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,346
No

333
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,307
I should get up and work too

334
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,893
Is there any freelancer as diligent as you?

335
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,980
All freelancers have to be diligent, you know?

336
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,732
Ah... Is that so?

337
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,525
I'll enjoy my coffee

338
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,574
I love you

339
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,409
Me too...

340
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,328
I'm going now

341
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,038
Ah!

342
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,873
I'll be late today because I have a company dinner

343
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,543
It's the day the project ends, so I can't skip it

344
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
It's okay

345
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,880
Take care

346
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,631
I'm off

347
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,090
Okay

348
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,457
Hello?

349
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,837
One more glass, please

350
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,718
You're this drunk without even finishing a bottle?

351
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,137
Yeah

352
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,016
You today...

353
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,311
Want to see how much I can drink?

354
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,772
Planning to go all the way?

355
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,941
That's right

356
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,318
I want to...

357
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,073
You'll stay with me, right?

358
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,669
Stop drinking now

359
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,212
This is the limit

360
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,882
No, I'm fine

361
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,051
Look

362
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,929
See? My tongue isn't even slurring

363
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,932
No, stop drinking

364
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,393
Tomorrow will be tough

365
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,229
You know you shouldn't mix alcohol with medication, right?

366
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,691
Really?

367
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,401
I didn't know

368
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,696
I'm telling you, you've had too much

369
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,157
Harry

370
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,247
I never understood why people drink when they're going through hard times

371
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:21,001
If you're tired, you should rest, right?

372
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,046
Drinking alcohol makes you feel worse, doesn't it?

373
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:29,050
But?

374
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,887
But...

375
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,763
But...

376
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,892
Now I think I understand

377
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,565
Without drinking alcohol...

378
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,110
I can't bear this moment

379
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,113
Sober

380
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,379
Did you say it?

381
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,351
I can't say it

382
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,519
Why?

383
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,189
Umm...

384
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,361
Because Ajin might leave?

385
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,160
Actually, I knew

386
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:43,041
From the moment I knew you lied to me

387
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,132
Ajin is an attractive person

388
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,720
She must be to anyone

389
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,265
What kind of nonsensical rationalization is that?

390
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,059
It sounds stupid, but

391
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,978
That's how it is for me

392
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,856
It's really stupid, isn't it?

393
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,529
Even after seeing those photos

394
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,198
I can't do anything about it

395
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,867
Sister

396
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,750
This morning, when leaving for work

397
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,298
She told me she loved me...

398
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,724
Don't you think that was sincere?

399
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,561
Could you tell me it was?

400
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,564
If she had two hearts

401
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,817
Maybe it would be like that

402
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,464
Drink some water, you must be thirsty

403
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,102
Harry, I'm sorry

404
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,521
What are you sorry for?

405
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,400
There's nothing for you to apologize for

406
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,694
We've known each other for 10 years

407
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,239
It's amazing that you haven't shown that side of you

408
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,243
Your heart

409
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,459
For pretending not to know...

410
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,753
I'm sorry

411
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,593
You knew?

412
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,098
I'm sorry

413
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,558
Am I really bad?

414
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,146
No, you're not bad

415
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,568
Maybe I'm not satisfied, but I can bear it

416
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,408
Go rest

417
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,368
I'll stay and watch you sleep

418
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,218
You lie down next to me too

419
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,112
The only thing I've wished for

420
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,740
While being by your side, sister

421
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,828
Is for an opportunity to come

422
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,291
And when that opportunity comes

423
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm confident I won't let it slip away

424
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,382
What opportunity?

425
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,011
The opportunity to have you

426
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,991
Don't you regret it?

427
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
I don't regret it

428
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,852
Are you up?

429
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,894
Let's eat ramen

430
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,187
We need to cure this hangover

431
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,076
Aren't you eating?

432
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't usually eat breakfast

433
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,881
I can't eat with you staring at me like that

434
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,800
Why? Does it make you uncomfortable?

435
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,552
A little

436
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,517
But

437
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,393
Yeah?

438
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,025
Never mind

439
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,818
What do you mean, never mind?

440
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,694
What is it?

441
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,363
About yesterday

442
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,492
What about yesterday?

443
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,247
Are you okay?

444
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,797
What do you mean, am I okay?

445
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,550
No, it's just...

446
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,303
We're not...

447
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,096
We're not anything yet

448
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,891
I still don't...

449
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,313
That's my answer

450
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,072
I'll make the ramen

451
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,281
Eat up

452
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,131
Answer it

453
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,226
Hello?

454
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,696
I...

455
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,032
Let me speak first

456
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,412
Actually, I...

457
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,873
I'm bi

458
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,044
And right now...

459
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,797
I'm also seeing another guy

460
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,259
That Jaehyun we met that time?

461
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,762
You knew?

462
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,473
I had a feeling

463
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,184
I found out not too long ago

464
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,648
I'm sorry for deceiving you

465
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,027
But you were always my priority

466
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,863
My feelings for you were genuine

467
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,241
Are you asking me to...

468
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,534
forgive you?

469
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,703
No

470
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,331
I want you to accept it

471
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,627
I think I...

472
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,254
I love both of you

473
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,635
Do you think that makes sense?

474
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:16,971
What about you?

475
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,681
What?

476
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,185
How do you feel about Hari?

477
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,312
Is it just casual?

478
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,527
I went to your place yesterday at dawn

479
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,820
I saw you two lying together

480
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,742
So I thought

481
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,869
You would understand me

482
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,870
That

483
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,455
Don't you think that's love?

484
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,794
What do you think love is?

485
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,048
Don't try to justify yourself with sophistry

486
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,966
I think love is

487
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,551
wanting to have something, whatever it is

488
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,012
Think about it

489
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,514
Don't you want to have both Hari and me...

490
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,516
by your side?

491
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,647
You're always like this

492
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,108
It seems like you're saying something profound

493
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,526
But if I listen

494
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,112
You're always trapped in your own world

495
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,740
Thinking that what you believe is everything

496
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,953
Because of your grand theory of love

497
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,580
My sincerity became insignificant

498
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,134
My love for you is sincere

499
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,678
I've never belittled your sincerity

500
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,595
It's just...

501
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,430
But you want to have both?

502
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,516
You say you love both?

503
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,019
Yes

504
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,854
I'll accept it

505
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,730
That you're that kind of person

506
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,566
But what can I do?

507
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,693
I'm not like that

508
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,153
Soyul, please

509
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:55,862
Stop

510
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,321
I don't want to hear any more

511
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,533
If I keep listening

512
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,286
I think even my mind will go crazy

513
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,454
Please don't contact me anymore

514
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,834
I'm begging you

515
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,086
Are you okay, sis?

516
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,698
I thought you'd be later

517
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,325
Are you alright?

518
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,377
What's wrong, sis?

519
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,852
Did something happen today?

520
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,030
What happened today?

521
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,217
Not answering?

522
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,928
Finally turned off the phone

523
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,266
Is it really over?

524
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,521
Haven't fought this badly in a year?

525
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,485
This isn't a fight...

526
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,363
I was just unilaterally abandoned

527
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,741
Are you sad?

528
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:31,744
Yes

529
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,704
My heart hurts

530
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,380
How long were you planning to hide it?

531
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,967
I was going to tell you soon

532
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,596
But not like this at all

533
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,476
You must have known too

534
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,187
That Soyul wouldn't understand

535
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,149
That's why you hesitated

536
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,568
Yes

537
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,737
I knew

538
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,907
So I tried to change but...

539
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,451
I couldn't

540
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,504
You have me

541
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,551
Me who accepts everything about you

542
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,219
Who understands you

543
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,179
Is that not enough?

544
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,101
That's not the issue

545
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,728
It's not about something lacking or being too much

546
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,064
That's not why people love someone

547
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,901
Then why did you meet me?

548
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,028
Huh?

549
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,407
If nothing was lacking with Soyul

550
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,617
Why did you meet me?

551
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,746
When I contacted you again

552
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,748
You could have ignored me

553
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,464
I don't really know either

554
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,966
Why I maintain

555
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,135
This different kind of relationship

556
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,224
Is it because of your childhood trauma?

557
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,768
About going to the orphanage?

558
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,941
Maybe that's why

559
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,737
Though they came to find me years later

560
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,282
I was confused

561
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,410
But my parents

562
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,912
Thought leaving me at the orphanage temporarily

563
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,164
Was the best option

564
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,504
It was a nightmare for you

565
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:48,839
Yeah

566
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,717
So I just...

567
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,470
The people I love

568
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,722
I want to keep them close

569
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,016
Both you and Soyul

570
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,569
Are you pretending to understand?

571
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,321
No

572
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,698
I'm trying to understand

573
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,368
No one understands

574
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,328
And you...

575
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,830
Think you're different?

576
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,293
I am different

577
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,672
From your past wounds

578
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,215
To your current conflicted feelings

579
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,508
I understand it all

580
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,888
Do you know what love means to me?

581
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,766
What?

582
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,397
Love is giving everything I can

583
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,359
So even when that relationship ends

584
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,778
The other person can't forget me

585
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,407
I stay in their heart forever

586
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,623
I'm not in the mood for that today

587
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,625
No?

588
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,587
Then I'll put you in the mood

589
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,422
No

590
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,581
I miss you

591
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,970
Sister

592
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,769
Stop feeling sorry for me

593
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,942
I know how you feel

594
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,738
I know things aren't settled yet

595
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,742
I don't think you were with me lightly

596
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,245
Because you're not that kind of person

597
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,288
Hari

598
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,291
I hugged you because I wanted to

599
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,419
If you think of it that way

600
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,338
Wouldn't you feel a bit better?

601
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,593
That I love you

602
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,305
It's not your fault, that's what I mean

603
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,268
If it's hard, find me

604
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,770
Lean on me

605
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,110
That's all I ask

606
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,572
Thank you

607
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,522
How's this place?

608
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,691
Hmm..

609
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,193
Looks nice

610
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,113
This is where that famous cafe is, right?

611
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:23,906
Yeah

612
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,116
They say lots of celebrities come here

613
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,452
The scenery is really beautiful

614
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,163
That's Jeju Island for you

615
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,374
My friend runs a guesthouse here

616
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,627
How about this weekend?

617
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,046
This weekend?

618
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,923
Just like that?

619
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:41,882
Yeah

620
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,258
Let's go

621
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,968
It'll be good to get a change of scenery

622
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,058
I'll rent a car

623
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,476
Just bring yourself

624
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,982
We'll figure things out when we get there

625
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:00,984
Should I make the reservation?

626
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,280
Sure

627
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,074
Really?

628
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,495
Actually, before summer comes

629
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,747
I've been wanting to go on a trip

630
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,842
When did you start liking me?

631
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,093
Huh?

632
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,514
No, just...

633
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,017
We've known each other for a long time

634
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,979
I was wondering when it started

635
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,526
Will you believe me?

636
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:44,486
Huh?

637
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:45,863
What is it?

638
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,615
From the moment I first saw you

639
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,873
When I entered school

640
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,000
I was looking for the teachers' office

641
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,878
And you showed me where it was

642
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,671
Since then

643
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,884
What... that's a lie

644
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,927
Why would it be a lie?

645
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,054
You know?

646
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,974
Back then I had these thick glasses

647
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,684
And was covered in acne

648
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,606
You're saying you fell for that?

649
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,648
No way

650
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,400
So what?

651
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,532
You...

652
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:33,577
You think I like you just because you're pretty?

653
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,747
Isn't that right?

654
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,998
No, it's not

655
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,595
I loved that look in your eyes

656
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,849
That voice when you talked to me

657
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,103
Even the way you brush your hair when you're shy

658
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,608
I loved everything about you

659
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,361
Pure

660
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,446
Rough around the edges

661
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,907
Without pretense

662
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,755
But why didn't you say anything?

663
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,093
Even as a joke...

664
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,553
You never said anything like that

665
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,934
I was afraid of losing you

666
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,231
Afraid that if I confessed, things would get awkward

667
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,317
Or that you'd leave me

668
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,365
But as time passed

669
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,533
I realized how foolish

670
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,369
My thoughts were

671
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,707
The person I love

672
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,501
Not being able to hold them

673
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,965
I realized how painful that was

674
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,565
It can take time

675
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,610
I've waited this long anyway

676
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,196
It's okay

677
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,546
[Ajin: Let's meet at the cafe in front of home this evening. I'll wait for you]

678
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,879
Should I say it's been a while?

679
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,633
Why... you?

680
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,635
Surprised?

681
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,264
Didn't think you'd be this clueless

682
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,226
I didn't think you'd stoop

683
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,853
This low either

684
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,689
I told you

685
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,858
That I'd take the chance when it came

686
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,360
I'm just doing my best

687
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,825
Soyul unnie

688
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,827
Why did you call me out?

689
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,833
Why should I tell you that?

690
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,001
Well...

691
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,301
Because I'm Soyul unnie's girlfriend

692
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,054
You're her girlfriend?

693
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,514
Yes

694
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,433
That's how it is

695
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,226
You two broke up

696
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,436
Because you cheated

697
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,979
That was because Soyul unilaterally

698
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,272
Got angry with me and...

699
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,398
Unnie

700
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,654
Is something wrong with your head?

701
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,448
So in that state you wanted to

702
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,200
Keep seeing Soyul unnie?

703
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,076
While disgustingly seeing another man

704
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,286
What?

705
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,958
Being extremely generous, let's say you loved both

706
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,127
Whatever happened, I understand

707
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,587
But...

708
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,255
Soyul unnie is already hurt

709
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,925
And she's over you

710
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,053
That's why she came to me

711
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,224
I came to tell you that

712
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,768
Because you don't seem to know it's over

713
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,647
So you two are dating now?

714
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:54,773
Yes

715
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,860
You have that person too

716
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,112
Good luck with that

717
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,997
Oh, right!

718
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,251
Thank you

719
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,422
For giving me the chance

720
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,232
What are you doing with the lights off, unnie?

721
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,609
Let's go get food

722
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,286
Haeri...

723
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,960
I can't forget Ajin

724
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,715
I'm having such a hard time

725
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:12,017
My chest hurts so much

726
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,771
Can't you bring Ajin here?

727
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,431
Aren't you going home?

728
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,557
Yeah

729
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,017
You're not going?

730
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,103
But...

731
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,730
Since we're always together like this

732
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,148
Don't we seem like a married couple?

733
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,818
When you think about it..

734
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,695
Is marriage really such a big deal?

735
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,115
Like this, a man and woman eating together

736
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,617
Sleeping together

737
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,454
Do you want to marry me?

738
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,623
Yes

739
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,626
Why?

740
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,255
There are many reasons

741
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,425
But the most important thing is

742
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,427
We're the most compatible

743
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,305
In what way?

744
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,766
In bed

745
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:39,896
No, when you get married

746
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,399
You have to have sex with just one person for life

747
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,276
Isn't that obviously the most important thing?

748
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,745
You're not going to get married?

749
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,163
Huh?

750
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,123
Marriage?

751
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,834
Your family might pressure you to get married later

752
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,419
Don't you think?

753
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,507
I haven't really thought about

754
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,342
marriage yet

755
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,429
What about you?

756
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,765
Have you thought about it?

757
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,976
I think about it every day

758
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,310
Every day?

759
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,271
About marriage?

760
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,315
I wish I could marry you

761
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,319
I wish I could just live with you forever...

762
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,696
Thoughts like that

763
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,073
Really?

764
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,659
What's so special about marriage?

765
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,204
Just living with someone you love

766
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,832
Living together in one house

767
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,710
Eating together, holding hands

768
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,003
Sleeping together...

769
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,673
Taking care of each other when sick

770
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,009
That's marriage

771
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,137
Won't you be conscious of others?

772
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,893
If we're too conscious

773
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,479
Should we just immigrate to another country?

774
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,355
What?

775
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:13,281
I just need you, really

776
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,785
Then I think I'd be fine without anything else

777
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:20,955
What about you?

778
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,708
I just need you too

779
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,136
It tickles

780
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,596
Try to endure it

781
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,848
If you endure the tickling

782
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,100
It can become an erogenous zone

783
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,709
I can endure it

784
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:15,426
As long as I can be with you

785
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,597
I love you

786
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,233
What are you thinking about?

787
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,323
I don't think I can do this

788
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,868
What do you mean?

789
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,918
I don't think I can live without Soyul

790
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,061
I'm sorry

791
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,356
Huh?

792
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,111
I think I was too hasty

793
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,163
You haven't sorted out your feelings for your sister yet

794
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,415
Just having me by your side

795
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,584
Must have been burdensome

796
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:36,007
With your personality, you probably couldn't tell me to leave

797
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,384
Haeri

798
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,928
I don't want to be a hindrance

799
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,058
When you've sorted out your feelings...

800
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:48,478
Give me another chance then

801
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,022
I'll wait

802
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,367
Go see Sister Ah-jin

803
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:11,250
I sent her a message to meet

804
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,795
I deleted it

805
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,089
And met her outside instead

806
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,301
I'm sorry

807
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,525
I'm leaving, sister

808
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,896
You're just leaving like this?

809
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,607
We're already over

810
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,026
Stop it now

811
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,154
Let go of this

812
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,823
No, I won't

813
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,534
You always do whatever you want

814
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,661
You think I'm easy now?

815
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,498
You're trying to dump me because I'm easy now?

816
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:35,918
I won't let go

817
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,628
Come in

818
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,841
Oh, just you wait and see!

819
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,472
What's wrong with me?

820
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,098
Anyway, to be treated as normal

821
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,725
Won't you need me?

822
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,061
Jaehyun, please...

823
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,481
You said you liked me too, right?

824
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,775
Isn't that why you chose me?

825
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,320
And now you're saying you're leaving?

826
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,615
This really makes me feel like trash

827
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,658
Let go!

828
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,910
Tell me!

829
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,789
Are you going to her?

830
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,165
Huh?

831
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,291
Hey!

832
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:18,836
Let go of that hand!

833
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,172
If you don't let go, I'll call the police

834
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,265
Are you okay?

835
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,936
You know what?

836
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:42,026
There's no hell like a relationship without trust

837
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,988
You'll be living in hell now

838
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,923
Aren't you scared?

839
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,092
Of what?

840
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,388
Of what will happen to us

841
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,600
Of how low we might sink...

842
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,771
Could it get any worse?

843
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,943
Even if it does...

844
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,778
It's okay

845
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,323
What about you?

846
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,912
I'm okay too
