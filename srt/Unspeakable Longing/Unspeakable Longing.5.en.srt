Shh.

all he thinks about is work.

why doesn't he just tell me?

that I paint

Your Highness.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,040
It's strange,

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
but it's quite nice.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,720
I mean your painting.

Today is a lucky day.

Miss,

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,640
should I call for water for you?

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,640
What water?

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,480
What are you thinking?

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,440
Xu Zeyu was snoring all night yesterday.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,600
What could have happened?

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
(This person's heart is already in turmoil.)

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,760
(Is the task about to be completed?)

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Your Highness.

55
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,800
Your Highness, how's the water temperature?

56
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,400
Your Highness.

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Fate

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
has mysteriously

59
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,800
bound us together,

60
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,720
but how can I

61
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,720
win your heart?

62
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
Youke,

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
can I really trust you?

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
Of course.

65
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Bai Youke!

66
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
Your Highness, are you alright?

67
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,240
I'm fine.

68
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840

73
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,280
Your Highness, take it slow.

74
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,360
Slow down.

75
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,440
