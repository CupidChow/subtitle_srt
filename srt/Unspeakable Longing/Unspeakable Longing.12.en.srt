00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,020
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,600
(In the middle of the night,)

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,720
(where did Qiao Shuangshuang go?)

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
Miss Qiao.

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,320
Sister Youke, you're here.

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,720
Come, please enter.

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,080
Miss Qiao, why aren't you surprised at all

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,200
that I, who should be in prison,

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,840
am suddenly out?

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,320
Naturally, it's because

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,640
His Highness is wise and brilliant.

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,840
He has already uncovered the truth

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,400
and cleared your name.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
But didn't Miss Qiao insist

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,440
that you saw me
stealing the drawing with her own eyes?

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,920
It was too dark at the time.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
I couldn't see clearly.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,080
Miss Qiao, you're really something.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,640
You can turn black into white

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
without even blushing or hesitating.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,680
Thank you for the compliment, sister.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
Qiao Shuangshuang,

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
you've done so many things

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,920
without success.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,160
Aren't you worried

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
that your behind-the-scenes boss

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,520
might abandon you
and find someone else to help?

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,000
What do you mean?

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,160
The meaning is obvious.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Your boss behind the scenes

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,640
thinks I'm more capable than you, so...

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,200
Then if I kill you now,

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
wouldn't I not have to worry

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,720
about being discarded?

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,040
Don't be rash.

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,840
We can talk this through.

39
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,440
Actually, you have another choice.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,240
That is to turn sides, become a witness,

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
reveal the mastermind behind all this,

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,200
and atone for your crimes.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,200
How dare you! You dare to trick me?

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
You...

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,160
(No, the Five Poisons Powder
is taking effect early.)

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Qiao Shuangshuang, what's wrong with you?

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,880
Let go of me!

48
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,840
Stop pretending to be kind!

49
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,280
People like us,

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,240
our lives are as insignificant as ants.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,200
Everyone's life is equal.

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,280
There's no distinction
between high and low, noble and humble.

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,560
You look down on yourself so much,

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,640
how can you face the parents
and relatives who love you?

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,310
Parents?

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,760
I lost my parents long ago.

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,000
They're all dead.

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Come here.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,040
Be careful.

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,880
Why are you helping me?

61
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,760
I can't just stand by and watch someone die.

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,200
You rest first. I'll go find a physician.

63
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
No need.

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,480
There's no cure for the Five Poisons Powder.

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,080
Without the unique antidote,

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,680
one can only rely on willpower to endure it.

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,640
He treats you like this,

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,280
yet you still risk your life to work for him.

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,160
Aren't you being foolish?

70
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,860
(In the dense forest of the eastern suburbs)

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
My Lord.

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,720
This is the antidote.

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Thank you, My Lord.

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
My Lord.

75
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,360
I...

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,800
My identity has been exposed.

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,080
Please punish me.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,440
I am willing to atone
for my crimes with meritorious service.

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
He discovered your identity

80
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
long ago.

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,080
Not exposing you

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,120
must mean he wants to follow the trail

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,280
to find me.

84
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
To be safe,

85
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
I can only sacrifice a pawn
to protect the king.

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,780
(Fragrant Orchid Elegant Chamber)

87
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Miss.

88
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
Miss, you're awake.

89
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
You're finally awake.

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,600
Why am I in bed?

91
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,400
You fell asleep

92
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,280
in Miss Qiao's room last night.

93
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,160
I carried you back.

94
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,440
Then where's Qiao Shuangshuang?

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,960
I don't know. I didn't see her.

96
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,440
(Oh no, could it be that Qiao Shuangshuang)

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,720
(discovered something and ran away?)

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
(If she's gone,)

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
(the clue to finding the mastermind)

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
(will be lost.)

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,040
(All of Xu Zeyu's efforts would be in vain.)

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,160
I need to go out for a while.

103
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,560
Where on earth did this Qiao Shuangshuang go?

104
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,960
The best place to hide in the city should be

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
the dense forest in the suburbs.

106
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,670
Qiao Shuangshuang!

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,440
Where are you?

108
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,160
Did I come to the wrong place?

109
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
Qiao Shuangshuang.

110
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,640
How are you?

111
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,280
You'll surely die if you continue like this.

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,400
We need to find a place
to bandage you quickly.

113
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,720
Where's your lady?

114
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
Your Highness.

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,160
She went out.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
Where did she go?

117
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't know.

118
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,360
Did anything happen in the mansion

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,760
while I was at the palace?

120
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,120
Miss Qiao has disappeared.

121
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,840
Oh right, the lady went out

122
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,160
after hearing about her disappearance.

123
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,920
Si, bring some men and follow me.

124
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Yes.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
It hurts.

126
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Bear with it.

127
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,920
It hurts.

128
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,200
Endure it.

129
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,040
Your Highness, someone said
they saw a young woman

130
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,080
- enter the dense forest.
- Miss Bai!

131
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,600
But this forest is dark and damp,

132
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,960
- full of snakes and wild beasts.
- Miss Bai!

133
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
Could Miss Bai have already...

134
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,600
Miss Bai.

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
Miss Bai.

136
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,400
Miss Bai.

137
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Your Highness.
