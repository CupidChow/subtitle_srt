(Elegant and Graceful)

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Your Highness,

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
the Princess Consort, she...

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,760
Youke,

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,800
you once said

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,360
you came from another world.

9
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,720
You said I was your destiny.

10
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,840
You recklessly made me fall in love with you.

11
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,880
But how could you be so heartless

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,480
to leave me

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,440
in such a cruel way?

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
You know,

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,720
I've never been an interesting person.

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
I never imagined

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
someone would care for me,

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,000
accompany me,

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,440
and stir all my emotions.

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Until one day,

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,200
I suddenly realized

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
that every time I closed my eyes,

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,000
I thought of you.

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Every day when I opened my eyes,

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,600
the first person I wanted to see was you.

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,160
I wanted to share my whole world with you.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,040
But you have your own world.

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,360
I can't selfishly

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
imprison you in mine.

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Your Highness!

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
