00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,860
(Prince Yu's Mansion)

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,800
Youke!

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
You're awake.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,600
How do you feel?

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Xu Zeyu.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,480
Xu Zeyu!

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Xu Zeyu…

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Xu Zeyu…

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,680
Xu Zeyu!

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
Prince Yu, it's getting late.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,240
You should go back to rest.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,480
Let me take care of her.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,240
Take good care of her.

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
My Lord,

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,160
I have something to report.

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
- Your Highness.
- Xu Zeyu!

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
Si.

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,160
Haven't you already achieved your goal?

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
This is my final warning to you:

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,160
stop disturbing

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,640
Youke's and my life!

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
She's about to become

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
my Princess Consort of Prince Yu.

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
She is not your Princess Consort.

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
My Lord.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,200
Go to Prince Yu's Mansion.

29
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Yes.

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,640
(Bai Youke and Xu Zeyu are in danger.)

31
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,720
(I'll protect them secretly first.)

32
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,140
(Prince Yu's Mansion)

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
Xu Zeyu!

34
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,840
Why won't you die?

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
Why?

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,240
Why do you keep haunting

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
between me and Youke?

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,240
Prince Yu, if you truly want Xu Zeyu dead,

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,640
I can lend you a hand.

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,440
Are you human or a ghost?

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,800
Whether I'm human or a ghost doesn't matter.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,960
What matters is
that I can help you deal with Xu Zeyu.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Why are you helping me?

44
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,080
I've long heard that

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,080
Prince Yu is brilliant and powerful,

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
handsome and wise,

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,920
a true dragon among men.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,040
So I've come to offer my services.

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
You have good taste.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,960
However,

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,120
I don't work with strangers.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,200
Show me your true face.

53
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,740
(Elegant and Graceful)

54
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,840
Oh, national defense map,

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,240
you really aren't a good thing.

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
If it weren't for you,

57
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
how would I have become

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,960
a lonely person,

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,480
so miserable and pitiful?

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,760
Forget it.

61
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,280
Since you're the source of all evil,

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,960
I might as well destroy you

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,520
and be done with it.

64
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,140
(Prince Yu's Mansion)

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,360
Prince Yu.

66
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
How did it go?

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,080
I've already obtained the national defense map

68
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,440
from Prince Rui's hands.

69
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Is that so?

70
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,280
Quick, let me see it.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,320
Could I possibly steal it from you?

72
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
No need to look.

73
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,200
May I ask how you plan to deal with Prince Rui?

74
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,880
How to deal with him?

75
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,200
Naturally, I'll charge him

76
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,840
with failing to protect the map,

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
and then throw him into the imperial prison.

78
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,600
(They're going to deal with Xu Zeyu.)

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,640
(No!)

80
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,880
(I must go tell him).

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,940
(Elegant and Graceful)

82
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
Youke.

83
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,080
Don't leave me.

84
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,360
Youke.

85
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,080
Youke!

86
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
Xu Zeyu, stop drinking!

87
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,680
You're in big trouble!

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,400
I must be dreaming again.

89
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
Otherwise, how could I dream of you?

90
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,160
Xu Zeyu,

91
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,480
look carefully.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
The person in front of you is me,

93
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,640
Bai Youke!

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,840
On such a beautiful night,

95
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,560
Miss Bai,

96
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,800
why aren't you enjoying the moonlight

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
with Prince Yu?

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,080
Why did you come here?

99
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,480
Did you lose the national defense map?

100
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,440
Prince Yu's people are preparing to accuse you

101
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,760
and throw you into the imperial prison.

102
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
You need to think of a way quickly!

103
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,880
Whether I think of a way or not,

104
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
whether I go to prison or not,

105
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
what does it matter to you?

106
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,560
Xu Zeyu, stop drinking.

107
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,280
No, otherwise...

108
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,960
You should escape quickly.

109
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,280
You should escape quickly!

110
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,800
- Escape to where?
- You should escape quickly!

111
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
All under heaven is the king's land.

112
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,960
Where can I escape to?

113
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm all alone anyway.

114
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
If I die, so be it.

115
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,520
Xu Zeyu, wake up!

116
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
Do you want to die?

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,680
What about your country?

118
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,520
I...

119
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,880
Say it!

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,080
Say it! What about you?

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,320
What about you, Bai Youke?

122
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
Say it!

123
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,040
What about you?

124
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
If you care about me so much,

125
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,960
why did you leave me so heartlessly?

126
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,960
Bai Youke,

127
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,560
which of your words

128
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,080
are true,

129
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
and which are false?

130
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,320
Tell me.

131
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Which of your words are true,
and which are false?

132
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
Xu Zeyu, no!

133
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
No!

134
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,760
No…

135
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,280
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,780
(Elegant and Graceful)

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Youke.

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't be afraid.

140
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,680
I'm here.

141
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,120
Xu Zeyu.

142
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,880
I'll kill you!
