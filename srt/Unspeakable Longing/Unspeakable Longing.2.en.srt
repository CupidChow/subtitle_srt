00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,980
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,400
Miss Bai.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,750
Let's part ways here.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,790
I hope you find a good match.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,070
The only good match in my heart is you.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,670
With my frail health and uncertain fate,

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,830
Miss Bai, please don't joke.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,870
Frail health?

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,430
You are a powerful general!

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,550
(I drew it, so I know best.)

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,950
That was in the past.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,670
Since my last injury,

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,590
my health has deteriorated,

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,750
and I fear I don't have much time left.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,590
(Have all the settings here gone astray?)

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,310
Escort Miss Bai back to her mansion.

19
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,030
Wait a moment!

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,580
Your Highness.

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,820
Your Highness,

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,750
can you tell me

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,230
why you keep rejecting me?

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,470
Why don't you like me?

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,870
Is it because

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,270
I'm not good-looking?

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,430
Miss Bai, your appearance

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,470
is pleasant.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,870
It's just that I,

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,790
I really...

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,040
Alright.

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,910
As long as you don't dislike me, that's fine.

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,390
I'll work hard to make you like me.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,640
Let's go.

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,880
Miss.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Your Highness,

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,270
I saw you were covered in wounds earlier.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,800
This is the medicine

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,770
the imperial physician prescribed
for me when I was injured.

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,710
It's very effective. You should try it too.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,270
Your Highness, take better care
of yourself in the future.

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,470
Madam, take a look.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,830
(Zuixian Tower)
Take care, take care.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,550
Miss,

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,470
why are we here?

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,990
I heard Si mention Zuixian Tower yesterday.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,870
I guess His Highness will definitely come.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,710
Lyuluo,

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,750
just do as I said later.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,190
Guest, your dishes are here.

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,670
- Here they are.
- Your Highness,

52
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,950
we are still a step too late.

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,310
This place has already been cleared.

54
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,040
Not too late!

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,710
She's like a fairy.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,190
A celestial being.

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,630
Miss Bai, didn't you return
to your mansion?

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,310
How did you suddenly appear here?

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,590
I'm waiting for you, Your Highness.

60
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,110
Miss Bai, how did you know I would come here?

61
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,070
The assassination attempt is a serious matter.

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,030
I guessed you would personally investigate,

63
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,070
and this Zuixian Tower is a strategic location

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,030
with a dense flow of people.

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,590
So, I came to check it out.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,470
I'm just trying to ease your worries.

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,950
Thank you, Miss Bai.

68
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,070
I can handle it myself.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,350
Truly a heroine
who doesn't let men overshadow her.

70
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Sixth brother,

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,750
what brings you here today?

72
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,190
Fourth brother, I invited a few friends

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,310
for drinks at Zuixian Tower today.

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,720
Fourth brother,

75
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,630
would you like to join us?

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
Miss,

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,790
I am the Sixth Prince, Prince Yu, Xu Zelin.

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,630
You can also call me Six.

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,870
May I ask your name?

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,380
Bai Youke.

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,710
Bai Youke.

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,550
What a good name!

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,120
- Six?
- Yes.

84
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,590
What a good name!

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,390
- A very good name.
- You understand me.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,550
May I ask what you usually like to do?

87
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,950
I like to paint.

88
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,960
Painting?

89
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,470
What a coincidence! I also love painting.

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,950
Let's have a session together someday.

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,410
No problem.

92
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,920
Come on.

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,630
Come on. So happy.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,760
Miss Bai.

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Fourth brother,

96
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,310
you are usually weak,

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,510
and today you are not feeling well.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,230
Why not go back and rest early?

99
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
Sixth brother,

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,150
I didn't know

101
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,790
you liked painting.

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,870
Fourth brother, you don't know me.
I just learned how.

103
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,070
Miss Bai.

104
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,980
Miss Bai,

105
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,790
you are still injured.

106
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,870
You should go back and rest early.

107
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,510
But I…

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,670
I haven't finished talking yet.

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,830
- Sixth brother.
- Miss Bai.

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Let's drink.

111
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,420
(Prince Yu's Mansion)

112
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,670
Your Highness, this hawthorn

113
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,830
must be kept by you for a long time.

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,950
Why?

115
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
Here you are.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,600
You don't understand.

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,030
My great benefactor

118
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,510
seems to have returned.

119
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,350
- Your Highness.
- How's the selection of concubines going?

120
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,350
Currently, the palace and various mansions
are recommending suitable young ladies.

121
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,910
Once the palace organizes everything,
they will pass it on to us.

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
Sure.

123
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,590
I want to meet every lady

124
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,750
who wishes to enter here.

125
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,590
I want to see

126
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,630
who is coveting the national defense map.
