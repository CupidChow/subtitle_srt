(Prince Rui's Mansion - Wedding Procession)

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,740
- Congratulations!
- Please come in.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
This way, this way.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,220
(Joyful)

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,240
(At this time,)

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,880
(Qiao Shuangshuang
should have rescued Lyuluo by now.)

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,400
(With Lyuluo rescued,)

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,680
(I have no more regrets in this world.)

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,960
(To die on my wedding day with Xu Zeyu)

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,160
(is a wish fulfilled.)

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,880
(Being able to marry you,)

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,160
(I'm already very content.)

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
(Even if I die,)

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,800
(I have no regrets.)

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,390
(Triumph in the Sky)
First bow to heaven and earth.

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,080
They're a perfect couple.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,940
Second bow to the parents.

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,500
Husband and wife bow to each other.

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,320
Go!

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
Yes!

24
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,260
(Joyful)

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,760
Youke, are you alright?

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm fine.

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,320
Be careful!

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Youke.

(Prince Rui's Mansion - Wedding Procession)

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
Tuoba Mu.

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
This is Prince Rui's Mansion.

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
You can't escape.

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,080
Bai Youke,

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,680
for the sake of a mere Xu Zeyu,

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,160
you're willing to risk your life

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,280
and Lyuluo's?

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,800
Lyuluo has already returned.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
What?

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
Miss.

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
- Lyuluo!
- Miss.

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Xu Zeyu,

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,520
so you knew all along!

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
Tuoba Mu,

44
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,160
you've already lost.

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,960
Do you think

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,160
you were my target?

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,520
How incredibly foolish!

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,800
Let me tell you,

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,400
I have the Empress Dowager

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,440
of Jingyao in my hands.

51
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,800
Bring her up!

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Xu Zeyu,

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,240
since I dared to come here,

54
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,680
I never planned to leave alive.

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,640
Since death is imminent,

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,800
I'll drag the Empress Dowager of Jingyao

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
down to the underworld with me.

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,880
It's worth it.

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
Once the Empress Dowager dies,

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
Jingyao will surely fall into chaos.

61
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,240
That's when my Xirong Kingdom

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
will trample over you!

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
Is that so?

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Are you sure

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
the one you've captured
is the Empress Dowager?

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
Qiao Shuangshuang?

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
How can it be you?

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,680
I have a question.

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,680
If Tuoba Mu's target was you,

70
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
then when we were in the forest cabin,

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,240
he could have easily set a trap

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
to kill you.

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,160
Why did he want me to marry you instead?

74
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,120
So Tuoba Mu's target wasn't me.

75
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,520
As everyone knows,

76
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,640
the current national defense map
isn't in Prince Rui's Mansion,

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
but in His Majesty's hands.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,040
So his target is His Majesty.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,240
But the palace is heavily guarded,

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
it would be difficult for him to make a move.

81
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,120
According to Jingyao's customs,

82
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
when a prince gets married,

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
His Majesty will surely attend in person.

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
If His Majesty falls into his hands,

85
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,400
we will certainly be at a disadvantage,

86
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,960
and the world will fall into chaos.

87
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,640
This way, he achieves two goals at once.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,800
This Tuoba Mu has indeed planned well.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
Then why don't we turn his plan against him?

90
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,040
On the wedding day,

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Miss Qiao, please rescue Lyuluo first.

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,040
Tuoba Mu will surely

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,600
ambush outside Prince Rui's Mansion early.

94
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,000
We'll wait for him to walk into our trap.

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,080
Tuoba Mu,

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,640
surrender now,

97
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,600
and I'll leave your body intact.

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
In my eyes,

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,800
there's no such word as surrender!

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll kill you first!

101
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,080
I have a question I want to ask you.

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,400
Speak.

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
Did you ever

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,480
have even a bit of pity for me?

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Silly child,

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,080
you are

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
the closest person to me in this world.

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,560
How could I hurt you?

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,080
I saved you

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
and I taught you martial arts.

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
You've been deceived by them!

112
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,080
They all deserve to die!

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Take this.

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Kill them.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
You're lying.

116
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,640
There's not a hint of pity in your eyes!

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Shuangshuang!

118
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,320
Shuangshuang!

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,360
Xu Zeyu,

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,880
don't be so smug.

121
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
You...

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
You Jingyao will perish.

123
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,200
Our Xirong will surely trample you!

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
Bai Youke,

125
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
you've been poisoned by my venom.

126
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,840
It will take effect tonight.

127
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll be waiting for you
on the road to the underworld.

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Miss!

129
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,040
Miss…

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,280
Youke.

131
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,960
Youke…

132
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,240
Your Highness, what should we do?

133
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Miss.
