Youke,

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,240
what are you...

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,360
Your Highness, you've come at the right time.

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm leaving.

8
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,040
Both the Bai's Mansion and Prince Yu's Mansion

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,440
have been sealed off.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,720
Where will you go?

11
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,800
The world is vast.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,240
There will be a place for me somewhere.

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
Bai Youke,

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,920
you clearly have feelings for me.

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,720
Why do you pretend to be

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,200
cold and heartless?

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,320
What exactly happened?

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Nothing happened.

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,400
I just dislike you.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
Is it because of this?

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Let go of me.

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
Xu Zeyu, let go of me!

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
Xu Zeyu, let go of me!

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,720
Xu Zeyu!

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,880
- If I let you go like this,
- Let go!

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,920

and have the coroner examine it.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Yes.

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Go on.

(Xu Zelin's Tomb)

Xu Zelin, I'm sorry.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,560
I'm not the person you're looking for.

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,400
I come from another world.

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
Another world?

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
What do you mean?

67
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,800
Are you also not the real Bai Youke?

68
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
I am,

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,560
and I'm not.

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,000
The reason I came here

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,840
was to complete the task
of the true love's kiss.

72
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
Before I turn twenty,

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,320
if this health bar becomes full,

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
it means Xu Zeyu has

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
fallen in love with me wholeheartedly.

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,920
At that time, when we kiss,

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,040
I can return to that world.

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
But...

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,400
Xu Zeyu will die.

80
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Then...

81
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
what if you can't complete the task?

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,920
When the time comes,

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
I will vanish into thin air.

84
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
I didn't expect you would

85
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
actively invite me to the Lantern Festival.

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm truly honored.

87
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,080
It's not fun to spend the Qixi Festival alone.

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,240
So I found someone to accompany me.

89
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,360
What? Your Highness doesn't want to?

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
I wish to spend every Qixi
with you for the rest of my life.

91
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
(Anyway, it's the last time.)

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,880
(Let's leave)

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
(a beautiful memory for each other.)

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,680
(Don't worry, Youke.)

95
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,480
(I won't let you die.)

96
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,520
(You'll have countless Qixi Festivals
in the future.)

97
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,010
Look, it's so beautiful.

98
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
Such beautiful fireworks.

99
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,600
It's a pity

100
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,290
they disappear so quickly.

101
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,680
You can't catch them even if you try.

102
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,080
It doesn't matter.

103
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,120
At least they were once brilliant.

104
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,600
That's enough.

105
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
Thank you,

106
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Youke.

107
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
Your Highness.

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
The coroner has results.

109
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,200
The body is not Bai Tingye himself.

110
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Your Highness,

111
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
this person was strangled to death first,

112
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,200
then thrown into the fire.

113
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,480
An extremely realistic
disguise technique was used.

114
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
Unless pierced with silver needles,

115
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,880
even those extremely close to him

116
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,040
would find it hard to tell.

117
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,200
I didn't know such evil techniques
existed in this world.

118
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
This disguise technique comes
from the Xirong Kingdom,

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
a mysterious family called Tuoba.

120
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,960
Many people thought

121
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,120
this technique was lost.

122
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,550
I didn't expect there are still people

123
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,520
who master this technique in the world.

124
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,400
Bai Tingye's family has been
from Jingyao for three generations.

125
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,720
How could they be related
to the Tuoba family from Xirong?

126
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
So the Minister Bai

127
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,040
who has been appearing before us

128
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,080
is not the real Bai Tingye at all.

129
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,560
(That was close.)

130
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
(I almost got him killed just now.)

131
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
(No.)

132
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,360
(I can't stay in the Prince's Mansion anymore.)

133
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,660
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

134
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,500
(To Xu Zeyu)

135
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
Youke.

136
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
Youke.

137
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,740
(To Xu Zeyu)

138
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,760
Xu Zeyu, goodbye.

139
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,280
I will always remember
how beautiful the fireworks were that night.

140
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,320
What's wrong, Miss?

141
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,720
Lyuluo, I think someone is following us.

142
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,560
Don't turn around.

143
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,400
Long time no see,

144
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,240
my dear daughter.

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,180
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

146
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
Your Highness,

147
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,920
the gatekeeper said he saw Miss Bai

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
leave with Miss Lyuluo at dawn,

149
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,360
and they seemed to be carrying luggage.

150
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,160
Seal off all city gates.

151
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Search for them.

152
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,580
Yes.

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,880
Prince Rui,

154
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,160
have you seen Bai Youke?

155
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
We agreed to meet at the city gate,

156
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,840
but I've been waiting and can't find her.
