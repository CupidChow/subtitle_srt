00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,980
=Unspeakable Longing=

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,880
Qiao Shuangshuang?

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,880
Why did you bring me here?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,480
You've been deceived by Bai Tingye.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,800
After I recovered from my injuries,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
I've been following the mysterious person.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,840
I accidentally discovered
that he is Bai Tingye.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,080
Show me your true face.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,840
If Father

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,960
is the mastermind behind everything,

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,200
what does he really want?

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,880
Have you ever considered

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,280
that he might not be your father at all,

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,880
and not the real Bai Tingye?

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,880
What do you mean?

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,080
I am from Xirong Kingdom.

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,080
All along,

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,000
the mysterious person
has been giving us tasks in secret.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,400
It's all for Xirong Kingdom.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,840
But I've investigated.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,760
Bai Tingye is a native of Jingyao Kingdom.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,240
So,

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,320
the real Bai Tingye
was killed and replaced long ago.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
I need to go and find out the truth.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
If you go now, aren't you seeking death?

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,760
The most urgent matter now

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,320
isn't Bai Tingye's identity.

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,200
Once Xirong Kingdom gets

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
Jingyao's national defense map,

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,800
they will definitely start a war

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
to seize territory.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,160
But Xu Zeyu is now in prison.

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,520
Jingyao has no capable generals

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,640
to lead the battlefield.

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
So our most urgent task

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,160
is to rescue Prince Rui.

38
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,160
I've done everything I can

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,480
to gain Prince Yu's trust,

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,800
but I can only visit Xu Zeyu.

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,160
I'll help you distract the guards later.

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,320
You go in and rescue him.

43
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,880
You're also from Xirong Kingdom.

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,520
Why are you helping me?

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,440
When war breaks out,

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
it's the common people who suffer.

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,920
No matter which Kingdom I'm from,

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,720
I don't want any of this to happen.

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,360
Moreover, after all I've done,

50
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,000
he still wants me dead.

51
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,560
I must have my revenge.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Let's go.

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,200
Who's there?

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Chase him!

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,120
Xu Zeyu, wake up.

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't sleep anymore, Xu Zeyu.

57
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
How are you? Does it hurt?

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,760
It doesn't hurt anymore.

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Come with me.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Come on.

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Be careful.

63
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,440
Slowly.

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Youke,

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
all these days,

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,320
you've been acting to deceive me, right?

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,120
You did all this

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
just to save Xu Zeyu.

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,600
Prince Yu, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
But I had no choice.

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Shut up!

72
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
Bai Youke,

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,360
I gave you my whole heart,

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,520
but in the end, it's not worth
even a strand of his hair.

75
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,920
If you can turn back,

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
we can still be friends.

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Friends?

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
I was ready to give you my heart,

79
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,600
and all I get in return is the word "friends"?

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,440
Is that so?

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,400
Sixth Brother,

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
you colluded with the Xirong Kingdom,

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,960
stole the national defense map,

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,560
and betrayed our Kingdom.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,760
Are you still so obstinate?

86
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,080
What Xirong Kingdom?

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,000
What betrayal?

88
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't understand, nor do I want to hear it!

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
The only thing I want to do now

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,840
is to make sure you die without a burial.

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,990
If you want to kill him, kill me first!

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,120
You're willing to die for him.

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,480
Fine.

94
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,720
I'll let you be a pair of love birds in death.

95
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,990
The imperial edict has arrived!

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,200
Prince Yu Xu Zelin, receive the edict.

97
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
The Empress Dowager decrees:

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,120
Arrest the traitor Xu Zelin.

99
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Xu Zeyu is about to die.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
With the national defense map in hand,

101
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,440
our Xirong army's southern invasion

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,160
is imminent!

103
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,060
(Imperial City)

104
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,440
This...

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
No!

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,480
We've fallen into a trap.

107
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
My Lord!

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
My Lord!

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,920
My Lord, it's terrible!

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,200
Xu Zeyu had already sent
the real national defense map to the palace.

111
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,320
- What?
- The Minister's Mansion is heavily surrounded.

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,880
Prince Yu has already been captured.

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
How dare they!

114
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,200
Xu Zeyu,

115
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,240
I will tear you to pieces,

116
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,240
and make you beg for life but wish for death!

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,320
Fire! Fire!

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,360
What... what's happening?

119
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,360
I don't know.

120
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
(Zuixian Tower)

121
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,640
Fire! Fire!

122
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,530
Run quickly!

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,960
Sixth Brother,

124
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
you still won't confess?

125
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,400
I am the noble Prince Yu.

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
I wouldn't stoop to such actions.

127
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,920
If you want personal revenge,

128
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
just say it plainly.

129
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,280
(To Prince Yu)
This letter was found in Bai Tingye's mansion.

130
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,440
It clearly shows evidence
of your collusion with Xirong

131
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,440
and theft of the national defense map.

132
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,480
(To Prince Yu)

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Moreover,

134
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,760
you are the mastermind.

135
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
So the Minister

136
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,040
had dug a pit for me to fall into all along.

137
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
Did you really not know
about the national defense map?

138
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
Prince Yu,

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,960
you've been used from beginning to end.

140
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,560
Why don't you tell the whole truth?

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,640
Prince Yu, Prince Yu!

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Sixth Brother.

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,880
- Go call the imperial physician!
- Yes.

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,600
Fourth Brother,

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
although I'm very unwilling,

146
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
but...

147
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll leave Youke to you from now on.

148
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,280
You must take good care of her.

149
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
If...

150
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,520
if you ever mistreat her,

151
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,720
I won't let you off even as a ghost!

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,760
Do you hear me?

153
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
Prince Yu, don't say anymore.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hold on.

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,280
Just hold on a little longer.

156
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,480
If my death

157
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,120
can leave a place in your heart,

158
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
then it's worth it.

159
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,760
You're back.

160
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
- Prince Yu!
- Sixth Brother!

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
- Prince Yu…
- Sixth Brother.

162
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,240
Prince Yu.

163
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,320
Sixth Brother.

164
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
Prince Yu.
