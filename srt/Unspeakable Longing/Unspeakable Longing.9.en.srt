00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,980
=Unspeakable Longing=

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,020
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,000
Miss Qiao,

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
please have some tea.

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,800
Miss Bai, you haven't rested yet?

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,280
I... I ate too much

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,600
and came out to walk it off.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,520
Would Miss Youke like

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,160
to sit for a while?

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,000
Sure.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,000
Since both of you are here,

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,520
I want to apologize

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,120
for the recent disturbances

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,880
in the mansion that have startled you.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,000
Let me toast you

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
with tea instead of wine.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,080
Speaking of which,

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,120
you must be curious

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,840
why the Emperor insists
on me choosing a consort

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,320
and who is trying

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
to assassinate me.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,280
(The Emperor is worried you covet the throne.)

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,840
(My comic)

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,520
(doesn't have
an assassination plotline for you.)

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,640
Please, Your Highness, tell us more.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,160
It all starts with this.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,160
What is this?

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,560
The national defense map.

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,640
It records the locations

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,400
of Jingyao's military supplies.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
If it falls into the wrong hands,

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,600
it could destabilize the Jingyao Kingdom.

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Why did the candle go out so suddenly?

35
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,000
(You couldn't hold back any longer.)

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
Maybe it was the wind.

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,160
I'll get a fire striker.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,520
Your Highness!

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
Something's not right.

40
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
I also know the layout of Jingyao's cities,

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,640
and the locations on this map
are completely wrong.

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Oh no,

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,120
this is a plan to lure out the snake.

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Your Highness!

45
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,560
Miss! Miss, you're awake!

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,600
Miss, are you alright?

47
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,480
Where am I?

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,560
How did I get here?

49
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,920
Miss,

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,320
Si and I walked into the study

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,760
and saw everyone on the ground.

52
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,480
You were holding the national defense map,

53
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
and Miss Qiao was seriously injured.

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,760
Your Highness, come here.

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Miss…

56
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
Your Highness,

57
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,600
what happened to my young lady?

58
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,480
You ask me what happened to your young lady?

59
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
She failed to steal secrets

60
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,000
and injured Miss Qiao.

61
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
It seems

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,880
both your young lady and you

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,440
are spies from an enemy nation.

64
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,240
Qiao Shuangshuang
had the national defense map

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
and could have left first.

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Why frame me?

67
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
The national defense map
is of great importance.

68
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
If all evidence points to me,

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
won't I die in this prison

70
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
before completing my mission?

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,440
I thought he had genuine feelings for me,

72
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
but it turns out I was just deluding myself.

73
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,660
(Elegant and Graceful)

74
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
Your Highness.

75
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,920
Your Highness,

76
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
the physician has checked

77
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,080
on Miss Qiao,

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
and she's not in serious danger.

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
But I really didn't expect it.

80
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,480
Miss Bai, who is usually so kind

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,680
and just,

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,280
turned out to be the spy in the mansion.

83
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
Your Highness,

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
you haven't really fallen
for Bai Youke, have you?

85
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,680
What should we do now?

86
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Anyone coveting the national defense map

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
will be executed without mercy.

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,000
Miss Qiao, are you feeling better?

89
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
- Just speak while lying down.
- Your Highness.

90
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,040
I feel much better.

91
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
Can you tell me

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,200
what happened that night?

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
That night,

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,640
when you went to light up the candle lamp,

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,600
I was so afraid of the dark.

96
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,160
When I got up,

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,640
it felt like

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,720
someone knocked me out.

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Bai Youke!

100
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,120
Miss Qiao,

101
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,680
you should rest well.

102
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,000
Those spies

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,920
have been thrown into the dungeon by me.

104
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
Just focus on recovering.

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,560
Your Highness,

106
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm scared.

107
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,560
Can you stay with me?

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Your Highness.

109
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
Your Highness,

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
Bai Youke still hasn't revealed

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,800
the purpose of stealing
the national defense map.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
Such a villain

113
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,320
won't speak the truth

114
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,440
without severe punishment.

115
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,520
You don't need

116
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
to worry about the interrogation.

117
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
Your task now

118
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
is to rest well.

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,640
I'll visit the dungeon

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,420
and come back to see you after I'm done.

121
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
Alright.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
(Bai Youke,)

123
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,600
