2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,520
Your Highness,

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,040
are you alright?

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Your Highness?

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
It seems he's really quite drunk.

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,920
You really look exactly like him.

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,280
Even though I know it's impossible,

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,840
this feeling of a secret crush

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,360
is really not easy to forget.

11
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
(He?)

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,400
(Who?)

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Perhaps letting this feeling
end without a result

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,000
is the best arrangement for us.

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,280
Actually, a lot happened today,

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,440
and I'm quite happy about it,

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,360
but there's also a lot I'm reluctant
to let go of.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,760
However, your drunken state

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,000
is quite adorable,

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,200
quiet and well-behaved.

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
(Bai Youke, are you tired of living?)

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,360
(Daring to use me as a stand-in)

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,720
(and even daring to touch me.)

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
I really want to

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,080
quickly win your true heart.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,480
Quickly!

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,280
(What a shameless woman!)

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
(Having another man in her heart)

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,200
(and still wanting my true heart.)

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,880
(Dream on!)

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,360
Forget it, let me feed you
some hangover soup first.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,400
I need to find a fire striker.

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
(Where)

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,480
(did the fire striker go?)

35
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,760
Si!

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,520
Your Highness, wait a moment.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,040
Si should be here soon.

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,160
Si!

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,440
What are you doing?

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,920
Bai Youke,

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
why are you here?

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,040
I saw you were unwell,

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,320
so I wanted to take care of you.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
Take care of me?

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
Are you really taking care of me,

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,880
or are you thinking

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,880
of someone else through me?

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,440
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Nothing.

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,320
There's no need for you here.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,440
Leave.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,480
- No. But you're like this now…
- Leave!

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,000
Fine, I'll go.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,480
With your personality, who would like you?

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,520
You can suffer by yourself!

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,040
Your Highness, it's my fault.

58
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,520
I was only thinking of guarding
against the escape of the man in black,

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
but I couldn't stop Miss Bai from coming in.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,760
How did the man in black escape?

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,600
I am incompetent.

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,880
I heard that Miss Qiao
disappeared from her room,

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,400
so I went to check the situation.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
As a result...

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
It's alright.

66
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,720
This time, I got drunk,

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
and Bai Youke used it
as an excuse to enter my room.

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,400
Qiao Shuangshuang also mysteriously

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
disappeared from her room.

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
These coincidences

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
make it impossible for me

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
to dispel my suspicions about the two of them.

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,000
Then I will investigate further.

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,520
Don't alert the enemy.

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,880
I have my own ways.

76
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,620
(Zuixian Tower)
Eat well and come again.

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,120
- Take care
- Take care

78
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,520
Recently, you two
have been staying at my mansion.

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
I have been lacking in my care,

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,120
but I am very grateful

81
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,720
for the understanding of you.

82
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
Let me toast to you.

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,640
(What is Xu Zeyu up to again?)

84
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
(He kicked me out yesterday)

85
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
(and now invites me to dinner today.)

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
(Did I reveal something last night?)

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,240
Your Highness, let me toast to you.

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,560
Your Highness

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm really sorry.

90
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Your Highness, you should drink less.

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,160
You got so drunk yesterday

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,400
that you hurt my hand.

93
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,560
Your Highness, let me drink this cup.

94
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,200
I've been at the Prince's Mansion
for many days,

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,720
thank you for your care.

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,480
I am very grateful.

97
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
It's what I should do,

98
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,160
but I still haven't taken good care of you.

99
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,840
Otherwise, why would Miss Qiao

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,480
leave her room

101
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
so late last night?

102
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,600
I wonder where Miss Qiao went?

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
(My mansion is heavily guarded,)

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
(not even a bird can escape.)

105
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
(I want to hear)

106
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,520
(where a weak woman like you went.)

107
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,760
(This guy was drunk last night)

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,840
(and still followed her.)

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
(I'm done for.)

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,440
(Xu Zeyu must be suspicious of me now.)

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,040
Don't laugh at me, Your Highness and Miss Bai.

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
I've been away from home for many days,

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,640
and whenever the moon is out,
I miss my parents dearly.

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
Especially

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,240
when I heard Miss Bai's voice

116
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,760
in His Highness's room last night,

117
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,800
I felt even more sorrowful.

118
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
I found a secluded corner

119
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
and cried for a while.

120
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
But don't worry, Your Highness,

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm much better now.

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,480
I'm the same as Miss Qiao.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,080
Every night,

124
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,120
I miss my parents.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
But fortunately, with His Highness's company,

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,120
I feel a bit warmer in my heart.

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
Since both ladies

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
miss their families,

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,040
there's a lantern festival tonight.

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
Why don't I take you both

131
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
out for a stroll?

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,760
(It seems there's an opportunity later.)

133
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,200
(I must dispel Xu Zeyu's suspicions about me.)
