After Bai Youke's "Silent Falling Longing"
was released,

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
it received great reviews.

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,660
When I was drawing the comic,

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,840
I really put myself in the shoes

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,960
of the female lead

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,280
and went through thick and thin

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
with my male lead, Xu Zeyu.

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,320
I think only when we truly immerse ourselves

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,720
can we give the audience
an immersive experience.

serializing a second season?

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
