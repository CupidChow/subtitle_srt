2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,700
(At Rui Wang's mansion)

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,160
(Youke)

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,880
(Why have you suddenly become
so cold towards me?)

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
Your Highness,

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,480
we still haven't found Qiao Shuangshuang.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,880
The clues to the person behind the scenes
have completely disappeared.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,280
Miss, did you have a fight with the prince?

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,600
If only it were that simple.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,810
Then...

12
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,120
Lüluo, don't ask anymore.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,040
I know this will hurt Xu Zeyu,

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,880
but...

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
Don't make a sound, or I'll take your life.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,640
Miss,

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,240
go back and tell Xu Zeyu

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,240
that if he wants Bai Youke to live,

19
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,000
he must exchange
the national defense map for her.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,440
Who are you?

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,880
Why are you capturing me?

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Because you're useful.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,440
(Useful)

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,880
(That means)

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
(he wants to use my life to threaten someone)

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,440
You want to use me

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,680
to exchange for the Jing Yao
national defense map.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,480
It seems you're quite smart.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,440
I've already left the prince's mansion.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,520
I have nothing to do with Xu Zeyu.

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,920
Do you really think I'm a fool?

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,960
The day you were poisoned,

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
it was Xu Zeyu
who sucked out the poison for you.

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,920
How could he watch you

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,320
trapped and not care?

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,920
You...

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,080
He will definitely come.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
(Xu Zeyu, you must not come)

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,600
It's already this late.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Rui Wang won't come.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
If you're going to kill or torture me,
just do it quickly.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
He's here.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
Xu Zeyu.

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
I told you not to meddle in my affairs.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Why did you come?

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
You want the national defense map?

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,200
I wonder if Prince Rui has brought it.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,880
Let's exchange the map

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,760
for the person.

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,160
Don't dream about it.

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Rui Wang won't give you
the national defense map.

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,720
Stop talking nonsense.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm asking Rui Wang.

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,360
The national defense map concerns
the foundation of Jing Yao.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
I truly cannot give it to you.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Alright.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,640
Since Rui Wang is unwilling,

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,080
then keeping her is useless.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Wait.

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
You've changed your mind?

61
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,360
Although I can't give you
the national defense map,

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,520
I can exchange one life for another.

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,520
To you Xi Rong people,

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,880
my life

65
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
should still be worth something.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Kill me,

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
and release her.

68
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,160
(Fool, who wants you
to exchange your life for another?)

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,800
(Self-important big fool)

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
(At Yu Wang's mansion)

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
Your Highness.

72
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,720
- Your Highness.
- Hold on.

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,600
This time it must be good news, right?

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
Miss Bai has been kidnapped.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,240
What? Kidnapped?

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,640
Yes, the spy in Rui Wang's mansion

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
said so.

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
With so many guards in Rui Wang's mansion,

79
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,600
a living person was just

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,360
kidnapped before their eyes?

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,680
Without Rui Wang's order,

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
they didn't dare to act rashly.

83
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,400
Useless, a bunch of useless people.

84
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,400
Bring the mansion guards and follow me.

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,920
Yes.

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
Xu Zeyu,

87
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,760
I thought you had some brains,

88
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,640
but I didn't expect you to be

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,280
a fool blinded by beauty.

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,360
You don't need to talk to me like that.

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,400
I know what I want.

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,920
Do you think I stayed by your side

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,280
because I really liked you?

94
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,360
The one I actually like is Yu Wang.

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
I stayed by your side

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
to gather information for him.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Did you really

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
take my false affection seriously?

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Youke,

100
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
I knew you had feelings for me.

101
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,280
You dog,

102
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,480
do you know who I am?

103
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,640
Surrender now,

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
and I can spare your life.

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,360
This Miss Bai is indeed extraordinary.

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,360
She has both of Jing Yao's
most powerful princes

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,700
wrapped around her finger.

108
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,120
What do you mean "wrapped around her finger"?

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
That's such an unpleasant way to put it.

110
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,240
You scoundrel, courting death, are you?

111
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,880
One hothead,

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
one sickly person.

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,160
I really want to see

114
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
which prince you'll go with.

115
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,680
Before I let you go,

116
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,080
you must give me the national defense map.

117
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Otherwise...
Otherwise, my ass.

118
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,640
I'll take your life now.

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Go!

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,680
Chase!

121
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
(No matter who you are)

122
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
(One day)

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,120
(I'll uproot all your schemes)

124
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,520
Are you alright? Don't be afraid.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
Thank you, Sixth Brother.

126
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
You can't protect Youke at all.

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Today, I must take her away.

128
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
What did you say?

129
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,040
Yu Wang, let's go.

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Alright.

131
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,680
Youke,

132
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,200
what's wrong with you?

133
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,040
The one I like

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,960
has always been Yu Wang.

135
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,920
Bring me wine.

136
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,680
Your Highness,

137
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
you can't drink anymore.

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Don't touch me.

139
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
Your Highness,

140
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,680
the residual poison in your body
hasn't been fully cleared.

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,000
How can you drink so much?

142
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,040
Let me help you rest.

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
Bring me wine.

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,600
Go!

145
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,180
(At Yu Wang's mansion)

146
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,720
Youke.

147
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
Yu Wang.

148
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,080
These are all my treasured possessions.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
From now on,

150
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,240
they're all yours.

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,360
They're so valuable, I can't accept them.

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,480
What are they

153
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,480
compared to you?

154
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,480
Nothing.

155
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,600
Youke,

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,280
marry me.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,560
Sorry, I can't.

158
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,560
- Yu Wang.
- Youke,

159
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,000
I swear,

160
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
I'll only be good to you in this life.

161
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,320
If I have a change of heart,
may I be struck by lightning.

162
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,160
- Please get up.
- I won't get up unless you agree.

163
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,840
Yu Wang, are you trying
to force me into marriage?

164
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,920
If that's the case,

165
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
then Youke

166
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,120
won't be able to stay
in the mansion any longer.

167
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Goodbye.

168
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,240
Alright, alright, alright.

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,640
I won't force you.

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,240
Yu Wang,

171
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
can't we just be friends

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
instead of a couple?

173
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
No.

174
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,640
You can only be my bride.
