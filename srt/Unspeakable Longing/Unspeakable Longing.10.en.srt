00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,980
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,380
(Prince Yu's Mansion)

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,720
Is the news true?

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,960
Absolutely.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,680
Is there something wrong

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,080
with Xu Zeyu's head?!

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,600
Youke is so devoted to him,

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,000
yet he not only doesn't appreciate it,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
he suspects her of being a spy

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
and locks her in jail!

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,400
I must go rescue her!

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,240
Your Highness,

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,120
if we go like this,

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
Prince Rui won't let us see her.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
I have a plan.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,640
You finally came.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
Xu Zeyu, use your brain!

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,760
It was Qiao Shuangshuang
who took the map, not me.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,800
How dare you!

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,800
Bai Youke,

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
I saw with my own eyes
that you stole the national defense map.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
How dare you still lie at this point?

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,720
No!

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,480
(A small scheme
has turned you against each other.)

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
(This national defense map)

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
(will eventually be mine.)

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Xu Zeyu, you heartless man!

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
You've wronged me!

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
If you want to kill or flay me,

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
do as you please.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
How could you still...

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
You've suffered

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,200
during this time.

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,740
(Elegant and Graceful)

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,920
(Thanks to my gynophobia,)

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
(Qiao Shuangshuang
has been completely exposed.)

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,120
(The mastermind will soon surface.)

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,200
Your Highness,

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Bai Youke has become estranged from Xu Zeyu

41
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,920
and has been thrown into the dungeon.

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,280
The task should be completed soon.

43
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,960
Your Highness, please see it clearly.

44
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,200
My daughter cannot possibly be a spy.

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,480
Minister Bai, please rise.

46
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,920
There are reasons for this,

47
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
and I will make the final decision.

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
My daughter was raised in the inner chambers

49
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
and has had little contact with outsiders.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,640
She is definitely not a spy.

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,480
I also believe Miss Youke

52
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
could not possibly be a spy.

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Then

54
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,360
why is she still in jail?

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Rest assured, Minister.

56
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
I promise

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,640
to clear Youke's name.

58
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,840
But now is not the time,

59
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,480
so she has to endure a little longer.

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,280
With your words,

62
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,160
I am relieved.

63
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,800
My daughter will be saved.

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
My daughter will be saved.

65
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,890
Escort the Minister back to his mansion.

66
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

68
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,540
(Purple Pavilion Shines)

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
According to the will of heaven,
The Emperor issued an order.

70
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,320
The daughter of Minister Bai Tingye, Bai Youke,

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,760
is virtuous, gentle,

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
and exemplary among women.

73
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
She has committed no grave offense
and should not be punished.

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,260
She is to be released
from the dungeon immediately.

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,200
This is the decree.

76
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,640
(When did the Emperor
pay attention to such matters?)

77
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,640
(It must be Sixth Brother's doing.)

78
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,360
What?

79
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Fourth Brother, are you defying the decree?

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,960
I accept the decree with gratitude.

81
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Fourth Brother,

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,960
where is Youke?

83
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,040
Take me to see her!

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,040
This way, please.

85
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Fourth Brother, let's go.

86
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Come on.

87
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,920
Miss Bai is of noble birth.

88
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,560
I dare not lay a hand on her.

89
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,400
Hurry up, stop dawdling!

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,600
If Prince Yu comes, we'll be exposed.

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,480
Lyuluo, quickly!

92
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,320
Stop hitting her!

93
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
My young lady is the daughter
of the Prime Minister.

94
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,600
If you hit her again...

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,920
- I'll…
- Stop!

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Youke!

97
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,480
Are you alright?

98
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Did I scare you?

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,380
Good thing I arrived in time.

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Prince Yu,

101
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm really not a traitor.

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
I believe you.

103
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Fourth Brother,

104
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
Youke can't stay here.

105
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,480
You can't take care of her

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
and have even harmed her.

107
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,480
I want to take her away!

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,240
Until the truth comes out,

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Miss Bai cannot leave here.

110
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,760
Escort Miss Bai to the other courtyard
and keep her under strict watch.

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

112
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,800
My Lord, did you summon me

113
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,360
for something important?

114
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,320
Do you know you've already
been exposed by Prince Rui?

115
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,640
Impossible.

116
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,240
Prince Rui used a counter-plan

117
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,840
to root

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,120
out everyone.

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,720
Fortunately, I sent someone
to test the waters

120
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,200
and managed to lure away
the tail following you.

121
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Otherwise, we'd be the ones

122
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
in the dungeon.

123
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,800
I failed in my duties.

124
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,920
Please punish me, My Lord.

125
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Prince Rui is exceptionally intelligent;

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,640
otherwise, he wouldn't
have survived until now.

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,840
He's not someone you can easily outsmart.

128
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,040
By the way, your Five Poisons Powder

129
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,000
should be about to take effect, right?

130
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,280
Yes, in the next couple of days.

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,920
My Lord, please give me the antidote.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,320
There is no antidote this time.

133
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
This is a small punishment for you.

134
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
If there's a next time,

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
don't expect to keep your life.

136
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,840
(Fragrant Orchid Elegant Chamber)
Youke, don't be afraid.

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,120
I will find a way to get you out.

138
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
Everything depends on you, Prince Yu.

139
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
Youke, I...

140
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
I warn you,

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,160
if you dare mistreat Youke again,

142
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,360
I'll make your life a living hell!

143
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,860
(Fragrant Orchid Elegant Chamber)

144
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
If it turns out that Bai Youke
is not involved,

145
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,520
I will release her.

146
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,000
The national defense map
is of utmost importance.

147
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,840
If Sixth Brother insists on interfering,

148
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,040
it won't be easy to explain

149
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,400
to the Emperor later.

150
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,000
For her,

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm not afraid of anything.

152
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
I, Xu Zelin,

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,360
swear here today

154
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,320
that I will get Youke back.
