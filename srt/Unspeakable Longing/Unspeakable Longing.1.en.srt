(Purple Pavilion Shines)

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,000
(Today is my wedding with Prince Rui.)

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,000
(Only with a genuine kiss from the prince)

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
(can I return to my own world.)

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,000
(The wedding hasn't started yet.)

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,600
(Sudden assassins disrupted everything.)

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,680
(But it's okay.)

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,240
(My husband)

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,760
(is the most honorable war god
of Jingyao Kingdom.)

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,540
(Purple Pavilion Shines)

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
(After this kiss,)

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,480
(I will return to the real world.)

♪When the great dream ends, don't pursue it♪

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,360
Bai Youke, how did Mr. Xu teach us?

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,720
We need to create some innovative

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
and sensational anime themes.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
What did you draw?
A time-travel tragic love story?

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,360
In this day and age,

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,400
will anyone watch it?

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,680
Before you leave work today,

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,920
you must send me

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,840
all the revised drafts.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
Nana, come here for a moment.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
Okay, Mr. Xu.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mr. Xu said,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
"If you can't revise it well,

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,280
don't even think about keeping this job."

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Mr. Xu.

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
You want something innovative
and sensational, right?

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Fine.

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll satisfy you.

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,680
(The daughter of the late Prime Minister
of Jingyao Kingdom.)

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,720
(A strange blood bar appears on her body.)

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,600
(She must receive a kiss
from Xu Zeyu to survive.)

37
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,720
(The most honorable war god,
Prince of Jingyao Kingdom, Xu Zeyu)

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,880
(has suffered from gynophobia since birth.)

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,000
(Contact with women causes him
to vomit blood or fall unconscious.)

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
(He cannot fall in love with any woman.)

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,280
(Or he will die suddenly.)

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
The end.

43
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
Since you don't cherish your work,

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
I'll drag you into the game.

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
(Entering the game?)

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
(Could it be that
I'm being transported into it?)

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,580
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,270
Where is this place?

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,190
Am I still dreaming?

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,870
Bai Youke, the system task is about to start.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,390
The time limit is before
the heroine's 20th birthday.

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,670
You have three months to complete the task.

53
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,430
Otherwise, you will not only fail
to return to reality

54
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,270
but also disappear completely
from both worlds.

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,800
Task? What task?

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,510
Miss, you're awake. Miss!

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,910
Miss, you're finally awake.

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Who are you?

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,150
I'm Lyuluo.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,030
I'm your dowry maid,

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,470
Lyuluo.

62
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,240
Yesterday we came
to Prince Rui's Mansion to bring joy.

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,150
Did you forget?

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,150
(Oh my)

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,350
(Have I really traveled into the comic world?)

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,910
(But I don't remember drawing)

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,350
(a maid named Lyuluo.)

68
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,510
The blood bar is still empty!

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,710
(Didn't I write this guy to death?)

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,550
(How is he still alive?)

71
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,230
Your Highness.

72
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,230
Your lady was injured because of me.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Let me do it.

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,820
Here, Your Highness.

75
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,050
Your Highness.

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,390
(Could it be that contact with her)

77
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,990
(really won't make me faint?)

78
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,790
(If you dare to touch me,)

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,310
(just wait to faint!)

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
(Indeed.)

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,430
(Contact with her doesn't affect me.)

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,470
(What's going on? Why didn't he faint?)

83
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,270
(I don't believe it!)

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,480
Your Highness!

85
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,070
Miss, you're injured. You can't do this!

86
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,600
Your Highness!

87
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,470
(It turns out he still has gynophobia.)

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,950
(But it doesn't affect me.)

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,750
Tell me the mastermind behind this.

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,750
I promise to spare your life.

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,350
Come closer, I'll tell you.

92
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,190
Long live Xirong, Jingyao must fall!

93
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,590
Long live Xirong, Jingyao must…

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
Your Highness.

95
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,110
Your Highness.

96
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,030
How long do you plan to pretend to be sick?

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,190
When the right person appears,

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,350
there will be no need to pretend anymore.

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,510
(A kiss will let me return to reality.)

100
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,990
(Strange, why does Xu Zeyu
also have a blood bar now?)

101
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,070
(And it's full.)

102
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,750
The Xu Zeyu here

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,870
has really done a lot for the people.

104
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,950
I can't worry about that now.
Let me get to the main task.

105
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,270
I just don't believe it.

106
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,470
What are you doing?

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,750
(Doesn't matter, just kiss first!)

108
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,310
(Why haven't I returned to the real world?)

109
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,750
(Is it because the kiss wasn't long enough?)

110
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,830
(Not deep enough?)

111
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,430
(Or not close enough?)

112
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,190
When you receive Xu Zeyu's
100% genuine affection,

113
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,030
the blood bar on your hand will be full.

114
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,830
Then, with a genuine kiss from Xu Zeyu,

115
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,030
you can return to reality.

116
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,710
(Can't the rules be explained all at once?)

117
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,950
What are you doing?

118
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,910
So you were pretending to be asleep.

119
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,030
Miss Bai sneaks into my room

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,190
late at night.

121
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,150
What exactly are you trying to do?

122
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,030
I... I got lost.

123
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,670
Using knockout smoke
can help you find your way?

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,750
I just wanted to test the effect of the smoke.

125
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,590
Just testing the goods.

126
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,990
Testing what goods?

127
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Testing you.

128
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,710
Your Highness, you said
we are already husband and wife.

129
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,510
Then I have

130
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,470
to test that.

131
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,830
For the life-saving grace of you,

132
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,030
I will never forget it.

133
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,430
I will send you back to the Bai's Mansion

134
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,070
and personally thank the Prime Minister.

135
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
Your Highness,

136
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,110
if you send me back,

137
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,990
what will others think of me?

138
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,790
Miss Bai, you are overthinking.

139
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,870
It was a forced situation

140
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,520
that led to your posthumous marriage with me.

141
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,310
On the wedding day,
the ceremony was incomplete.

142
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,350
This marriage ends here.

143
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,360
This posthumous marriage
is an ignorant and outdated custom.

144
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,790
I have already requested to abolish it.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,870
In the future, women will be free
from such persecution.

146
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,480
That won't do.

147
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,470
I truly like you.

148
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,150
I have admired you for a long time.

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,030
I am willing to be with you for a lifetime.

150
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,830
In my heart, there is only
the country and its people.

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,230
There is no room for personal feelings.

152
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,710
I'm afraid I will disappoint your intentions.

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,390
Your Highness! Your-

154
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,910
Your Highness, I didn't know Miss Bai

155
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,550
was in your room. I-

156
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,070
You two can talk first.

157
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,270
Anyway, I have plenty of time

158
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,630
with His Highness.

159
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,630
I'll head back to my room now.

160
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,950
Your Highness, our people
saw some strangely dressed individuals

161
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,910
entering and exiting Zuixian Tower in the city.

162
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,150
I suspect it's related
to the previous assassination.
