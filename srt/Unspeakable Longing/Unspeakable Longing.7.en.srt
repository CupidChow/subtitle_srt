3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,800
- Look at this.
- It's really beautiful.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,720
Boss, how much for one?

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,920
Miss, five coins for ten rings.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,200
Miss, would you like to buy some?

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,650
No, thank you.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,160
Your Highness.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Thank you.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,960
Alright.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,720
If you like one, I can win it for you.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,720
Is it true that if I ring it,

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,920
I can take it?

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,560
Yes.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,480
Haven't you played before?

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,520
I have lived in the palace since I was little,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
spending all my time

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
on studies

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,280
and state affairs.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,880
I've never been to a lantern festival

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,080
or played these games.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,520
Today,

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,600
let me help you make up

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
for your lost childhood.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,880
I'll do it.

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
No worries, you go ahead.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
You're amazing.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Miss, you're amazing!

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Miss!

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,360
Your Highness, be careful!

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,200
Qiao Shuangshuang!

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Miss Qiao!

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,640
Chase them!

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,840
Run!

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
Miss!

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Miss!

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
Your Highness, are you alright?

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,160
Miss Qiao is injured.

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
I'll take her to a physician first.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Go ahead.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,560
Yes.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Yes.

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Take her back to the Mansion.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,800
Are you alright?

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Tell me.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,120
Who sent you to assassinate His Highness?

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,680
What a pity!

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,960
I was so close

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,760
to killing you.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Was the man in black last time

52
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,720
also your man?

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,890
So what if he was?

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,920
Our lord's great plan is about to succeed.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,720
We do not fear death.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
Fine,

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
I'll grant you that.

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Xu Zeyu,

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,880
if you dare let Miss Bai be in danger again,

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,200
I will not forgive you!

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,600
How did Sixth Brother know

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,760
that Miss Youke and I were attacked?

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Such a big event,

64
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,960
it's all over the streets.

65
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,440
Fourth Brother,

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,160
if you can't protect Miss Bai,

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,250
you should let her go early.

68
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,320
Be sensible.

69
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,330
I will protect her.

70
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,160
You protect her?

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
Sixth Brother, have you forgotten

72
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,200
how many troubles you've caused
since childhood?

73
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,720
And who cleaned up after you?

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,120
So who really needs protection?

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
I...

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,960
Your Highness.

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,160
What are you two doing?

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,440
We are just

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
bonding.

80
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,000
Interesting.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
- Miss Bai.
- Miss Youke, have you rested well?

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,280
If you feel bored and want to go out,

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
just tell me. I'll accompany you.

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,680
Fourth Brother,

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,120
I think you should go back and rest early.

86
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,280
It's late at night.

87
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,920
If another assassin appears,

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,360
even a cat or dog

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,120
could scare you,

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,680
and it would trouble Miss Bai.

91
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,640
Xu Zelin.

92
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,720
Miss Bai, you can just call me Six.

93
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,960
Six,

94
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,320
I think

95
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,640
you must really like walking by the sea

96
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,720
and living by the seaside.

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,040
You're meddling too much,

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,280
even with your Fourth Brother.

99
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,200
No.

100
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,080
Miss Bai, you misunderstood.

101
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,000
Recently, there have been many incidents
around Fourth Brother,

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,760
so I'm here to check on him.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,720
Miss Bai, why don't you come to my mansion?

104
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,960
We have everything

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,120
you want to eat or play.

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,200
You can go anywhere you want.

107
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,080
I heard you like horse riding and archery.

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
I have a large horse ranch

109
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,520
with top-quality horses

110
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
for you to choose from.

111
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Let's go now.

112
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Since everyone is interested in horse riding,

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
I wonder how the horses
at Sixth Brother's mansion

114
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,200
compare to mine.

115
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,240
Sixth Brother,

116
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,720
you know

117
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,230
that Fourth Brother has been away
from the battlefield for a long time.

118
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,260
Keeping those horses in the stable

119
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,420
is a waste.

120
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,820
Since Miss Bai is staying at my place,

121
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,420
if she wants to,

122
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,780
I'll teach her to ride.

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,820
No need to bother you.

124
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,420
- Fourth Brother, you...
- Exactly.

125
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,460
With His Highness teaching me,

126
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,260
even if it's not a fine horse,

127
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,620
just a little donkey,

128
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,780
I'd still be happy.

129
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,260
I

130
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,100
will fully respect Miss Bai's wishes.

131
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,900
However, Miss Bai,

132
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,740
my Fourth Brother lives very frugally.

133
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,740
If you need anything,

134
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,660
just tell me.

135
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,860
I will not hesitate to help.

136
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,740
Then I will take my leave.

137
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,990
No need to see you off, Sixth Brother.

138
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Si.

139
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,860
- Your Highness.
- The documents I asked for,

140
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,460
why haven't they been delivered?

141
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,440
What documents?

142
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,900
Suddenly feeling sleepy, I need to rest.

143
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,500
Your Highness, what documents?

144
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Don't say anything.

145
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,740
Say what?

146
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,980
- But Your Highness...
- Enough, Si.

147
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,140
What documents?

148
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,580
- What documents?
- Si.

(Prince Rui's Mansion)

150
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
Youke,

151
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,740
I am so understanding,

152
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,140
considerate, and caring for you.

153
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,300
Am I not a hundred times better than Xu Zeyu?
