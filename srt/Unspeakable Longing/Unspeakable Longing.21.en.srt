Lyuluo, Lyuluo!

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,160
Lyuluo, wake up! Lyuluo!

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,640
Lyuluo!

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,360
- Stop wasting your efforts.
- Lyuluo.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,160
She's been poisoned by my venom.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,560
She won't wake up anytime soon.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,800
If you have any issues, come to me!

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,960
You're not my father.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
Who are you really?

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
Where is my father?

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
My dear daughter,

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,600
when you were three years old,

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,200
I

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
replaced your father.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
I can't keep pretending

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,360
after all these years
of father-daughter relationship.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,240
I've had enough

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,280
of pretending to be Bai Tingye.

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
I can finally be myself.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,960
My true identity

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,360
is from Xirong,

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,280
the renowned descendant of the Tuoba family,

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,880
Tuoba Mu!

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Ugh!

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't care who you are, Tuoba Mu.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
Let us go immediately!

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,640
I can let you go,

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,120
but you must do something for me.

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,520
Never!

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,760
You want to kill me? Go ahead.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,720
Lyuluo!

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
If you don't agree,

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
I'll make her die miserably in front of you.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
I agree with you!

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,560
Daughter,

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,960
I almost killed her.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
Luckily, I was careful,

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,280
or she would have died.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,040
What do you want to do?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
You just need to return to Xu Zeyu's side

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,440
and have him

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,760
hold a grand wedding ceremony

45
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
for you.

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
I promise

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
to let her go.

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
The national defense map
is no longer with Xu Zeyu.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
Killing him won't help you.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
That's not your concern.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,320
Just do as I say.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,520
If I go back now,

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
Xu Zeyu will suspect me.

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,240
He won't marry me!

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
I've already arranged everything for you.

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,600
Your Highness, don't worry too much.

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,080
Youke

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
might just be playing around.

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Your Highness, we found something.

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,360
There's news about Youke.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,390
We've discovered the true identity
of the person behind it.

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
The one impersonating Bai Tingye is Tuoba Mu,

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,560
a Xirong national.

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,920
He seems to be hiding in the dense forest

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,280
on the outskirts after faking his death.

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,960
Tuoba Mu.

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,200
This person is cunning and calculated.

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,200
Youke's disappearance

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,080
might be related to him.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Take some people

71
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,920
and search thoroughly for me.

72
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,740
- Miss Bai.
- Miss Bai!

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,280
- Miss Bai!
- Youke!

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Check over there.

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
- Youke!
- Miss Bai!

76
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,120
Miss Bai!

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,480
- Miss Bai!
- You…

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Youke!

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
Are you okay?

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
As long as you're okay,

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,720
that's all that matters.

82
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,720
Where did you go?

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,880
I regretted it as soon as I left.

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
I wanted to come back for you,

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
but…

87
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,200
I had my reasons

88
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
and couldn't tell you.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Alright,

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,640
nothing else matters.

Xu Zeyu,

94
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,480
will you marry me?

95
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
I know it's sudden,

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,000
but this time,

97
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,560
I want to be with you.

98
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
