00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,580
(A Match Made in Heaven - Female Destiny Card)

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,440
Who

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,760
is it?

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,520
Is my daughter

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,400
going to the consort selection?

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,520
Yes.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,800
I even

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
prepared a portrait for the selection.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,680
Nonsense!

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,960
The entire court is eyeing

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,200
Prince Rui's Mansion like a tiger.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,120
That place

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
is a dragon's den!

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,720
You've barely escaped once,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,760
and you want to go back?

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,200
But father,

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,120
I truly like him!

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,200
If you don't let me go,

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,080
I won't be able to eat or sleep.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
It would be like death!

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Alright.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,800
It's true that a grown daughter
can't be kept at home.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,760
It's my fault for spoiling you
when you were little.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,520
Father, you're the best.

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,440
I'll go prepare now. Thank you, father.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
No, daughter!

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,900
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,840
Xu Zeyu,

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,400
you can't escape from my grasp!

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,840
Miss, what are you smiling
at your arm for every day?

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Highness,

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,080
do you notice anything different
about me today?

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,840
You...

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,920
what are you doing?

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't you want me to see

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,880
what's different about you today?

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,000
So, did you notice anything?

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
The same silliness.

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
Your Highness,

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,360
I am here for the consort selection today.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,520
If I don't get selected,

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,480
I won't be able to show my face.

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,360
In return for taking an arrow for you,

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
why don't you go easy on me?

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,960
Are you trying to use the back door?

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Yes, indeed.

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,280
Do you really want
to enter the mansion as a consort?

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Of course.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,040
I am sincere to you.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,880
Don't you believe me?

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,800
Miss Bai, please behave.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,960
Your Highness, the auspicious time
has arrived.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
We can depart now.

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,160
Let's see

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,360
Miss Bai's wonderful performance later.

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,180
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you want?

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,040
Little sister, I'm determined
to get the position of Princess Consort.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
I see you're still young,

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,680
so don't get involved in this mess.

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,840
Go back quickly.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,160
Watch out!

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,320
We need to create innovative

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,040
and sensational anime themes.

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,480
What did you draw?

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Can you capture the current market?

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,800
(It really is a small world.)

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Are you okay?

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,040
I'm fine.

72
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,240
You are...

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,360
Bai Youke.

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,080
the legitimate daughter of Prime Minister Bai.
I've heard of you.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
May I know who you are?

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,560
I am Qiao Shuangshuang, the second daughter

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,380
of the governor
of Ning City

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
and the adopted daughter
of the Empress Dowager.

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,960
Oh, just the daughter of a small governor.

80
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,800
One might think you're
a princess from some country,

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,440
- being so arrogant.
- You...

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,880
Miss Qiao, I see you have a beautiful face

83
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,440
but such a malicious heart.

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,640
Bullying the weak

85
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
is not something to be proud of.

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,320
If the Empress Dowager finds out,

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
it could tarnish your reputation.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,960
I was just kindly reminding you.

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Since you don't appreciate it, forget it.

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Miss,

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,320
this person doesn't seem like a good person.

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't worry, she can't beat me.

93
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
I've read so many palace intrigue novels.

94
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
- These little tricks
- Palace intrigue?

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,600
don't concern me.

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,880
(Feiyun Pavilion)
Miss Qiao

97
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,040
truly deserves the title
of the most talented women in the world.

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,080
Her musical skills are so exquisite.

99
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm afraid the position of Princess Consort

100
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
is hers for sure.

101
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,200
Miss Bai,

102
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
what talent will you show us?

103
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,280
Miss Qiao, you're really concerned about me.

104
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,560
I don't know any of the arts,

105
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
so I won't embarrass myself here.

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,880
She doesn't know any of the arts.

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
We shouldn't learn from her.

108
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Okay, I'll definitely study hard in the future.

109
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,000
But I won't give up the position

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
of Princess Consort.

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,720
The ladies are performing arts,

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,880
but I learned some tricks

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,360
from foreigners.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,280
Let me show you today.

115
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Heavenly spirits, earthly spirits,
super transformation!

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,680
This must be celestial magic!

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,600
Miss Bai must have received divine teachings.

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,440
Yes, indeed.

119
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,780
This is called magic.

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
What magic?

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,880
Just some street performer's tricks,

122
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,130
not worth showing.

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Yes.

124
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
- It's amazing!
- Yes.

125
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,720
Flowers for the hero.

126
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Miss Youke,

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
I am not a hero.

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
Your Highness, you lead soldiers

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,320
to defend the land and protect the people.

130
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,800
In my heart, you are a hero.

131
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,080
Miss Youke is always so special,

132
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,840
always doing things

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,720
beyond my expectations.

134
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,560
Then I'll take it as a compliment from you.

135
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,040
It's just a trivial skill,

136
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
yet you dare to perform it here.

137
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,200
This is a consort selection,

138
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,560
looking for a lady

139
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
proficient in the arts,

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,600
not a street performer.

141
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Tao, don't speak nonsense.

142
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,840
The foundation of a nation lies in its people.

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,840
Whether they are laborers

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,160
or performers,

145
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,200
they are all part of this country.

146
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
You are here

147
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,000
not just because of your parents,

148
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,840
but because of the contributions

149
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
of all the people.

150
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
I…

151
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,640
I didn't expect Miss Youke

152
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
to have such awareness.

153
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,880
Miss Bai's words

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,360
make me feel ashamed.

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,760
I was clearly talking about your performance,

156
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
but you're twisting words!

157
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,600
Alright, quiet down.

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
I already have an idea
about the consort selection today.

159
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,400
The results will be announced shortly.

160
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,640
(Elegant and Graceful)

161
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
Your Highness,

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
I find Miss Bai quite interesting.

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,160
She always surprises us.

164
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
And when she's near you,

165
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,960
your gynophobia doesn't act up.

166
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,720
You two are truly a match made in heaven.

167
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,280
I don't think

168
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,920
she has any ulterior motives.

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
Maybe she really likes you.

170
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Your Highness, perhaps you should…

171
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,720
Sorry for my rudeness.

172
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,680
So, Your Highness, about today's ladies...

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
Today,

174
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
the candidate
who can enter the Prince's Mansion

175
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,800
is Qiao Shuangshuang,
the daughter of the governor of Ning City.
