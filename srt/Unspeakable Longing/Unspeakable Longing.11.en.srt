3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,200
My Lord, there's news from the palace.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
Prince Yu has accused Prince Rui
before the Empress Dowager

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,160
of abusing his power
against the Bai family's daughter.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,840
It seems they have completely fallen out now.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
I didn't expect Prince Yu
to be such a romantic.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,280
Now I have another helper on my side.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,060
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
Your Highness, please punish me.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,560
Did you lose them?

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,600
Suddenly, many men in black

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,560
appeared on the street.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,040
I couldn't distinguish them and lost track.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,000
The person behind this is really cautious.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
Get up.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
Don't show any signs
in front of Qiao Shuangshuang.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,120
Act like you know nothing.

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,440
Yes.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,280
Your Highness,

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,360
my lady caught a cold from the rain.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,000
She's now running a high fever.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
Please go see her quickly!

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,840

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,080
Xu Zeyu, where are you?

Your Highness.

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Xu Zeyu.

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,560
Who are you?

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
I am you.

30
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,160
You killed Xu Zeyu.

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
No, it wasn't me.

32
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120

33

Really, it wasn't me!

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,920
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,680
I didn't do it!

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,480

37

at other people's things casually?

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,720
Last night, I was bored

73
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
so I opened it and took a look.

75
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,160
it to be quite interesting.

78
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,640
the style is witty and humorous.

countless people have gossiped behind my back

that Prince Rui's is amassing troops
and becoming a threat.

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,000
