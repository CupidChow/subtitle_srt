3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,760
Wait a moment.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,560
The Prime Minister's daughter,

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,960
Bai Youke, has also been selected.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,520
I object!

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,920
Miss Youke is mine

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,240
and cannot be your consort.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
Is that so?

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,640
Yes.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,880
Then why don't you ask her

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,040
what she thinks?

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,440
Miss Youke,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,880
with your status and beauty,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,400
how can you share a husband with others?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
I swear,

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,480
I will love only you for my entire life

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
and will never let you down.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,200
Thank you for your affection, Sixth Prince.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,860
But matters of the heart
are like drinking water;

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,400
only the drinker knows if it's warm or cold.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm afraid I must decline your affection.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,200
Miss Youke, how about this?

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,880
If one day you no longer like Fourth Brother,

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,440
Prince Yu's Mansion will always welcome you.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,680
Xu Zeyu!

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,160
If you dare to treat her poorly,

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,800
I won't let you off!

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,720
Today, Your Highness has chosen me.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,320
Could it be that Your Highness is sincere?

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,000
Miss Youke is talented and beautiful.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,480
If you were not selected,

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
it would be unfair.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,280
(Xu Zeyu.)

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,280
(Let's see how long you can resist.)

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
(What is your true intention?)

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
(Despite being rejected repeatedly,)

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,600
(you still want to stay by my side.)

Annoying Xu Zeyu!

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,400
Annoying as a boss, even more so as a prince!

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
Your painting is not bad,

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,280
but your archery isn't great.

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Stand straight,

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
keep your body steady,

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,120
and breathe evenly.

protect the country?

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,880
Your Highness, can't you think about something
other than protecting the country?

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,000
I hope

60
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,880
you can love yourself a bit more too.

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Practice on your own.

62
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,480
Painting is easy.

63
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,920
Your Highness.

64
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Your Highness,

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,480
as you instructed,

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,460
I have prepared rooms and gifts

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
for Miss Qiao and Miss Bai.

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,040
However, I don't understand

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,120
why all the preparations for Miss Bai

70
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
are of the highest quality,

71
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,840
while those for Miss Qiao
are slightly inferior.

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Anyone approaching me at this time

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
must be after the national defense map.

74
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,760
This arrangement is to see

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,440
if they are in cahoots.

76
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
If they are,

77
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,120
they won't care about these trivial matters.

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,160
(This vixen really has some tricks.)

79
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,880
(His Highness treats her so well.)

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,760
(This can't go on.)

81
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,720
Your Highness, you truly care for me.

82
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,560
I will serve Your Highness well in the future.

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,080
Your Highness.

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,880
Please keep your distance, Miss Qiao.

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,040
Your Highness, are you rejecting Shuangshuang?

86
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,560
I have a cold

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,990
and am afraid of infecting Miss Qiao.

88
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,400
Aren't you afraid of infecting Miss Youke?

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,800
Yes, Your Highness.

90
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,400
You shouldn't favor one over the other.

91
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,640
You must treat everyone equally.

92
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
Bai Youke,

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,960
now you're trying to push me away.

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,360
What, you don't cherish it once you have it?

95
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Your Highness,

96
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,640
you're using a petty mind

97
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
to judge a noble heart.

98
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,400
With a beauty by my side,

99
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,680
how can I be a killjoy?

100
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,600
(Bai Youke!)

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,920
- Miss!
- Be careful!

102
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Your Highness!

103
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Your Highness!

104
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Your Highness!

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
What?

106
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
- Someone, help!
- Your Highness!

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,520
(Prince Rui's Mansion)
Qiao Shuangshuang knocked His Highness down!

108
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,360
What a coincidence!

109
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,280
Miss Bai is also here
to visit the His Highness.

110
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
With such a good opportunity,

111
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,400
Miss Qiao probably doesn't want
to miss it either.

112
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't quite understand what you mean.

113
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,280
His Highness is seriously injured,

114
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,680
and I feel guilty,

115
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,120
so I came to visit.

116
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,640
Do you have other intentions?

117
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,600
Miss Qiao's acting

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,800
is a pity His Highness can't see.

119
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,380
(Elegant and Graceful)

120
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,160
His Highness is resting and not seeing guests.

121
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,880
Please leave.

122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,080
In that case,

123
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,720
please pass this to His Highness for me,

124
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Guard Si.

125
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,400
This is the chicken soup
I made for His Highness.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I hope he recovers soon.

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,520
Alright.

128
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,200
Miss Bai, you can give yours to me too.

129
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
Miss Bai!

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,880
Good dogs don't block the way.

131
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Didn't you see?

132
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,960
His Highness and my lady
are building their relationship.

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
What are you doing here

134
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,080
as a roadblock?

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,480
Move aside, go.

136
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,680
If you insist on going today,

137
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,120
you'll have to step over my body!
