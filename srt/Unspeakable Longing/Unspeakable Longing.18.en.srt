00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,100
(Elegant and Graceful)

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,840
Youke.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,640
Don't be afraid.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm here.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
Xu Zeyu.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
I'll kill you!

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,080
Prince Yu, don't!

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,760
(Imperial Edict)
Prince Rui Xu Zeyu, receive the edict.

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,080
According to the will of heaven,
the Emperor issued an order.

12
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,920
Prince Rui Xu Zeyu has failed
to protect the nation,

13
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,680
resulting in the loss
of the national defense map.

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,160
The border is unstable,
and the army's morale is shaken.

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,720
He is ordered
to be immediately imprisoned

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,320
to await further disposition.

17
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,700
(Elegant and Graceful)

18
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,420
(Prince Yu's Mansion)

19
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Youke, are you feeling better?

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Come on, I've made some tonic for you.

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Try it and see if it tastes good.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,880
Thank you, Prince Yu.

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
But I have no appetite now.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
It's alright.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
You can have it when you feel like eating.

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,720
Prince Yu,

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,320
when will Prince Rui be executed?

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,840
Do you want him dead?

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
I understand your feelings.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,400
I stayed at your mansion all this time

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,080
just for a situation like this,

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,320
so that I could help you.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,600
Now when I think about

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,240
how Prince Rui pretended to be kind,

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,480
I find it disgusting.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
Youke,

37
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,400
since you want him dead,

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,760
he must die.

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
How about this?

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,720
I... I'll go to the prison again

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,400
to "greet" him properly.

42
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
I must dig out more of his crimes.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,840
I want to go with you.

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
How can that be?

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,200
That filthy place,

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
I'm afraid you won't like it.

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
He once imprisoned me in the dungeon.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,920
Now the situation is different.

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
He's become a prisoner.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,320
I want to see how arrogant he still is.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
- Prince Yu.
- Prince Yu.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,280
Prince Rui,

53
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,760
how does it feel to be in prison?

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,200
Youke is asking you a question.

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,080
Why doesn't Fourth Brother answer?

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,720
It's alright if he doesn't answer.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
The suffering I once endured,

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,360
I will return a thousand, a hundred times over.

59
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,480
If you beg for mercy now,

60
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,240
you might suffer less.

61
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Youke is telling you to beg for mercy.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,960
The high and mighty Prince Rui,

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
do you need someone to teach you how to beg?

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll teach you personally.

65
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Beg for mercy!

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,360
Beg for mercy now, quickly!

67
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
Prince Yu,

68
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
leave him his insignificant life.

69
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,880
We can torture him slowly in the future.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,200
I'll spare your life today.

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Let's go.

72
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,960
(I've treated you like this.)

73
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,840
(Why hasn't your health bar decreased?)

74
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,080
(Xu Zeyu,)

75
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,400
(what are you thinking about?)

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Youke,

77
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
why are you sitting here?

78
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,480
I wanted to know

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,400
what you and Prince Rui talked about.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
So I waited for you here.

81
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Why do I feel

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,720
that you seem to care about him more than me?

83
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm getting jealous.

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
I just wanted to know

85
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
how miserable he is.

86
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,600
Then... I won't ask anymore.

87
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,080
Prince Rui will be very miserable.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Forget it.

89
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,720
Let's not talk about these unpleasant things.

90
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
Youke,

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,400
what do you think

92
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
about our marriage?

93
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,600
Marriage is a serious matter,
not to be taken lightly.

94
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
I...

95
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,800
I still need to go back
and ask my father's opinion.

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,640
Alright.

97
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,120
Then go ask quickly.

98
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,720
But I promise you,

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,960
father-in-law will definitely agree.

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
(That's not necessarily true.)

101
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,520
(I must get my father to delay the marriage.)

102
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Father.

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,700
(Today, by Prince Yu's order,
all secret guards are commanded)

104
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,360
(to kill Xu Zeyu
and welcome Xirong Kingdom)

105
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
Youke, why are you here?

106
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,360
This is my home.

107
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
Why can't I be here?

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,360
Don't look at them.

109
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,560
It's all in the past.

110
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,160
Father, what is this?

111
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,720
Don't ask.

112
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,120
Since you've already seen it,

113
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,080
pack your things and come with me quickly.

114
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,440
If we're late,

115
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,680
there might be mortal danger.

116
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,600
Mortal danger?

117
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,360
What exactly is this, Father?

118
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Father, tell me,

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,640
what exactly is this?

120
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Father, say something!

121
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,720
It's Prince Yu.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,400
Prince Yu threatened me with you to help him.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,920
Now,

124
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,120
he must have taken the national defense map.

125
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
He might kill Xu Zeyu at any time,

126
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
and then come to kill me.

127
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
No, let's go.

128
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Father will take you away.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
We can't leave.

130
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
I don't want to be the daughter
of a criminal official.

131
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm going now.

132
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm going to see the Emperor
and the Empress Dowager.

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,040
Father, wait for my news!

134
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
(Sparing your life back then)

135
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,280
(was indeed the right decision.)

136
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,760
(Go.)

137
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
(It's best to let those Jingyao
fight among themselves)

138
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,840
(and create chaos.)

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,840
Come here.

140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
Qiao Shuangshuang?

141
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,640
Why did you bring me here?

142
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,280
You've been deceived by Bai Tingye.

143
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,680
After I recovered from my injuries,

144
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
I've been following the mysterious person.

145
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,560
I accidentally discovered
that he is Bai Tingye.
