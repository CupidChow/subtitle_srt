3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,600
Miss Bai.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,480
Miss Bai.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,600
Miss Bai.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,720
Miss Bai.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,080
- Miss Bai.
- Miss Bai.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
Your Highness.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Continue searching.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
Yes.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,720
I didn't expect

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
that you would be the one to save me.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,920
Who tried to kill you?

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,990
It was the mysterious person
behind the scenes, right?

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,680
He actually showed mercy to you.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
I used my inner strength to seal my breath,

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,480
making him think I was dead.

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
Who is he?

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,480
I really don't know.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
He didn't care about you at all.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
He wanted to kill you.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
Yet you're still helping him cover-up?

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,160
I really didn't know.

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
Every time I meet him,

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
he always wears a mask.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,320
And

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,920
his voice is disguised too.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
But I do know one thing.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,040
- What?
- He's from the Xirong Kingdom.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,160
No wonder he wants
the Jingyao national defense map.

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,360
(I need to hurry back and tell Xu Zeyu)

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
Fortunately, it's not serious.

33
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
In two more days, you should recover.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,360
I'll leave now.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Wait.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,480
Will you

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,800
tell Prince Rui about my situation?

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
I won't.

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Youke!

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,080
Youke!

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Miss Bai!

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,640
Youke!

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
Miss Bai!

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,720
Youke.

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Youke.

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,200
It's alright.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Let's go home.

48
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,380
(Prince Rui's mansion)

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Miss!

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,800
What happened to my lady?

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Call the imperial physician.

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Call the imperial physician!

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,920
Youke.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,800
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,320
I shouldn't have tested Qiao Shuangshuang.

56
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,760
I originally wanted to do it for your plan,

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
but now Qiao Shuangshuang is gone,

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,640
and we can't find the person behind the scenes.

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
It's not your fault.

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,040
I've thought about it carefully.

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
They must have known it was a trap all along.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,480
Your Highness, if I die,

63
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,400
you must protect yourself well.

64
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Don't let yourself be assassinated again.

65
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
Alright, I understand.

66
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,120
Don't speak anymore.

67
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
There's one more thing.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,760
I already know

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
that the person
who wants the national defense map

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,120
is from Xirong Kingdom.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,360
You must be careful.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,040
You must be careful. You must…

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
(Youke,)

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,400
(you'll be fine.)

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
(The imperial physician will be here soon.)

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,100
(Elegant and Graceful)

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
How is it?

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
Your Highness,

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,840
it's too late.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,040
The poison has entered the bone marrow.
It's beyond treatment.

81
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,640
Forgive my incompetence.

82
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
Your Highness,

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,760
if someone could suck out the snake venom

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,520
and draw it into their own body,

85
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,120
there might be a slim chance of saving her.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,960
However, in doing so,

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,480
the person sucking out the poison
would face danger.

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
Youke.

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Don't be afraid.

90
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm here.

91
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,640
