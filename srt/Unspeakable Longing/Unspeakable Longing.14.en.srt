3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,320
Physician, how is he?

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,440
Strange, it's really strange.

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,200
What exactly is wrong with him?

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,880
Don't worry, miss.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,280
The poison in His Highness's body isn't deep,

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,440
but his pulse is very peculiar.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,880
In my decades of medical practice,

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,280
I've never encountered anything like this.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
This won't do.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
I must go back
and consult my medical books now.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,680
I must figure out what's going on.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,600
Physician!

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,680
At least prescribe some medicine!

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
Physician!

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,960
(Could it be that he truly fell
in love with me wholeheartedly?)

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
(That's why even this small amount
of residual poison)

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,920
(has affected him so much.)

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,720
You must be alright.

21
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,700
What's wrong?

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Cold.

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,360
Does this feel better?

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
Cold.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,560
So cold. So cold.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is it any better?

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,880
(If I kiss him now,)

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,920
(would I be able to go home immediately?)

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,480
A true love's kiss is about to be triggered.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,360
Bai Youke,

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
are you sure you want to complete the mission?

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,080
We were originally

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,760
people from different worlds.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,040
Why should we entangle with each other?

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,960
Forgetting each other

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,720
is the best outcome.

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
System tip:

38
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,200
Once a true love's kiss is triggered,

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,920
Xu Zeyu's life value
will immediately drop to zero,

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
and he will die from ruptured blood vessels.

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
What?

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
So,

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
this is why you also have a health bar.

44
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
Another reminder:

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,360
If the female protagonist
doesn't complete the mission

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,840
before her 20th birthday,

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,120
she will completely disappear
from both worlds.

81
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,880

Minister,

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,000
if you have any troubles,

85
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,440
feel free to tell me.

You are Youke's father.

87
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,080

88
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,440
I will certainly brave any danger
without hesitation.

89
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
Prince Yu,

90
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
my daughter has been
in frequent danger recently,

91
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
her life hanging by a thread.

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,920
As her father, I feel helpless,

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,240

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,480

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,440
you don't know.

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,640

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,720

98
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,040
My daughter

99
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,640
must have been bewitched by Prince Rui,

100
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
losing her senses.

101
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
It truly disappoints Prince Yu,

102
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,680
and your sincere affection for her.

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,920
In my eyes, I think

104
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,480
my daughter will surely regret it one day.

105
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,240
Minister, do you truly think so?

106
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,280
Of course!

107
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,120
A father knows his daughter best.

109
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
are truly a match made in heaven.

110
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,840
Let me pay respects to you, father-in-law.

111
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,120
Prince Yu, please rise.
This won't do. This won't do.

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
Prince Yu, please rise.

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
don't worry.

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,920
why don't you

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
go ask Si about the situation?

127
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
Alright.

128
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
No need.

129
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm already fine.

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360

I was worried you might
still have residual poison,

137
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,880
so I brought you a detoxifying soup.

138
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,040
Come, drink some while it's hot.

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
No need.

140
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't want to drink it now.

141
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,720
Youke, are you...

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,240

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,920
No.

144
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,640
Drink some while it's hot. Come on.
