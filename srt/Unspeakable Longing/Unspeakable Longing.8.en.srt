=Episode 8=

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,520
(Is he still suspicious of me?)

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,000
(What should I do?)

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,680
Miss Qiao, how are you feeling?

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,560
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,920
My injury is not serious.

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,640
Miss, you're still pretending
to be strong at this time!

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,200
The physician said

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,560
if the wound had gone a bit deeper,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
you would have been beyond saving!

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,000
Tao, stop talking.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,240
Miss Qiao, I will never forget

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,200
your life-saving grace.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,320
Your Highness,

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,720
I saved you willingly,

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,320
not to demand gratitude

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,440
in return.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
Your Highness,

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,680
can't you see

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
my feelings for you?

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,480
From the first moment I saw you,

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,720
I...

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,120
Shuangshuang!

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
Shuangshuang!

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,600
Your Highness is here too.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
(Surprised to see me, aren't you?)

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,840
(Good thing I was smart enough)

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,080
(to have someone keep an eye on here.)

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,800
You're here to see Miss Qiao too?

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Of course.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,080
Miss Qiao was injured because of us,

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,280
so as soon as I heard she was awake,

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,600
I rushed over.

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Miss Qiao, are you feeling better?

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120
Thank you for your concern, Miss Bai.

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
Miss Qiao,

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,000
I had the kitchen
make some chicken soup for you.

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,040
Drink it while it's hot.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
Your Highness,

41
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
our young lady has weak hands

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,920
and might pull at her wound.

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Why don't you feed her yourself?

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,880
After all,

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
our young lady was injured

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,040
for you.

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
Yes,

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
I didn't consider that.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,680
Your Highness, let me do it.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,920
Your Highness,

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,960
you're used to being served by others.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,600
How would you know
how to serve someone else?

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,080
Besides,

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,640
if you accidentally hurt Miss Qiao,

55
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,920
that would turn a good deed into a bad one.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Miss Qiao is also my savior.

57
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,800
It's only right for me to take care of her.

58
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
That won't do!

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,480
Why not?

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,920
Since when

61
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,880
do servants decide matters

62
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,320
concerning your Miss Qiao?

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,280
Do you want to be the young lady yourself?

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
- You...
- Lyuluo!

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,080
Your Highness, I...

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
Sister Qiao,

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
I have experience, don't worry.

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
Thank you, Miss Bai.

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
No need to be formal with me.

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
Here.

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,880
Your Highness, Miss Bai,

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
the chicken soup is delicious.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,680
There's

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
no need for Miss Bai to continue feeding me.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
My injury hasn't healed,

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,240
and my head still aches a bit.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
Then perhaps…

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Miss Qiao should rest well.

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,960
I will visit you again later.

80
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,440
Miss Youke, why are you leaving
in such a hurry today?

81
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
I think

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,120
it's because you're reluctant
to leave Miss Qiao,

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,760
so you're walking so slowly.

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
Lyuluo, let's go.

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Miss!

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
I have no romantic feelings

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
for Miss Qiao.

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,880
She was injured because of me,

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,360
so it's only natural for me to visit her.

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Alright.

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,240
There's something I don't understand.

92
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,000
I hope you

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
can help clarify.

94
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
Go ahead.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
How did you know

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,320
that I faint when I touch a woman?

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
Tell me,

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,920
how did you know?

99
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
Alright, alright.

100
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,400
Isn't it obvious?

101
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,000
I've long heard
that you don't get close to women.

102
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,080
You don't even have a maid in your mansion.

103
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,200
Besides, Lyuluo and Qiao Shuangshuang

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,720
once touched you,

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
and the moment they did,

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
you fainted.

107
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,920
Who would react like that normally?

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,200
(She discovered my strange illness
so early on.)

109
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
So you knew from the start

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,520
that nothing would happen when we interacted?

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
Yes.

112
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,040
Aren't I special?

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
So

114
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
this means

115
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
we are destined

116
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,960
for each other.

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Xu Zeyu, just accept me.

118
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,160
You'll keep this secret.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
Alright,

120
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,840
I'll keep your secret

121
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,240
about your gynophobia.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,680
Thank you, Miss Youke.

123
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Since

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,760
I've helped you so much,

125
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,040
shouldn't you agree

126
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,200
to a small request of mine?

127
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,880
Go ahead.

128
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
You always call me

129
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,200
Miss Youke, Miss Youke.

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,880
I'm tired of hearing it.

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,960
Why don't you just call me

132
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,120
Youke?

133
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,000
Is that alright?

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
Youke.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,960
Say it again!

136
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,440
Say it again! Come on!

137
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,880
Are you shy?

138
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,880
Your Highness, say it again!

139
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
Greetings, Your Grace.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,880
You sent a signal urgently to see me today.

141
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
What's the matter?

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Your Grace,

143
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,120
this time I blocked a knife for Xu Zeyu,

144
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
and it seems to have temporarily dispelled

145
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,600
his suspicions about me.

146
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,640
You've done well.

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
However,

148
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,520
the Prime Minister's daughter, Bai Youke,

149
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,720
seems to have fallen in love with Xu Zeyu

150
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,320
and is secretly protecting him.

151
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,200
This is very detrimental to our plan.

152
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,200
Your Grace has meticulously planned
for so many years,

153
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,440
investing a lot of manpower,

154
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,440
material resources,
and financial resources.

155
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,680
I don't want anyone

156
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,040
to hinder our plan.

157
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,520
Anyone who stands in the way
of Xirong's great plan

158
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,640
to annex Jingyao must die.

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,600
If Buddha blocks, kill Buddha;
if ghosts block, kill ghosts.

160
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes.

161
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,540
(Elegant and Graceful)

162
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Your Highness.

163
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Your injury hasn't healed,

164
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,520
yet you still have the interest
to play the zither.

165
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
Your Highness,

166
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,600
the moon is bright tonight,

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,560
and I was moved by the scenery.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,680
Therefore,

169
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,320
I transformed my feelings into music

170
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,400
and offer it to you,

171
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,440
hoping you can understand my feelings.

172
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
I do understand,

173
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
and that's why I hope you
take care of your health.

174
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,560
What are you looking at, Your Highness?

175
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,560
Nothing.

176
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,800
Miss Qiao, the night is deep
and the dew is heavy.

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,960
Let's go inside to talk.

178
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
That sounds great.

179
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,120
I was just thinking
of discussing poetry and songs with you.

180
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,040
