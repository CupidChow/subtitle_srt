1
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,900
You're here. You're here.

2
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
Li, why are you here again?

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,009
What a coincidence.

4
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,020
Why do I always come to Xiao Zheng?

5
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
everyone

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,460
We're all here.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,720
Let's work together

8
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's get together.

9
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
But

10
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,800
You don't look well.

11
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,240
Let's sit down and talk.

12
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,960
Zheng, I won't beat around the bush.

13
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,320
Huacai Hall is the best

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
in Chang'an.

15
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,920
The business is getting bigger and bigger.

16
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,840
I talked to you several times before.

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
but you refused.

18
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,640
Why didn't you tell me the reason?

19
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,079
I'll ask you one last time.

20
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,280
ask you one last time.

21
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,120
What condition will the Chamber of Commerce offer

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce?

23
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
You're asking too directly.

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
I don't know what else I can do.

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,840
Why don't you make it clear?

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,680
Let me think about it.

27
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Stop looking.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
Xiao Zheng.

29
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,940
Have you organized the language?

30
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,400
Almost.

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
"Separate the hatred" means "Separate the resentment".

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,920
What you said just now

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,680
has a huge logical problem.

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,920
Huacai Hall is now

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,820
the leader of the whole Chang'an.

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
Why do you need the help of the Chamber of Commerce?

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I can help you expand more business.

38
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,480
and make your business the whole Tang.

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,460
If you want to do business, you have to take the water route.

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,490
But the boss of the waterway

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,040
is our shareholder.

42
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
The people who make money

43
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,480
Don't worry about taxes.

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
I can ask the court

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,660
a better taxation policy for you.

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
taxes

47
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Give it to the people and use it for the people.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,529
We must pay every penny.

49
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,640
Besides,

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,200
it's time for the treasury to be weak.

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
It's time for us to contribute.

52
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,320
Right.

53
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,360
Well said.

54
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,560
Yes.

55
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,080
The Chamber of Commerce can't give you anything now.

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,120
But there's one thing I don't understand.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,050
why all the people who befriend you

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,640
even those who were your enemy

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
worked with you.

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm the only one who's willing to work with you.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,880
No.

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,560
I've said so many strong reasons.

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
but I couldn't convince you.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,050
I have to say something more cruel.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
Because they have a simple relationship with me.

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,240
We're friends.

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,760
But you...

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,200
like me.

69
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
I've let you go in my heart.

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,520
No.

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
You don't.

72
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,640
I can let you go.

73
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,120
You really don't.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,560
Well, maybe I haven't done it yet.

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,120
But I'll try my best.

76
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Let's talk about it

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,050
when you make it.

78
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
Is that the only reason?

79
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,320
If you want to

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
just want to do business with us,

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,200
We welcome you no matter what.

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,560
But you're not doing anything for yourself

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
not for yourself.

84
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,020
You are working for Lord Wu behind the Chamber of Commerce.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
What Lord Wu did

86
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,000
is not a good thing.

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,780
We don't want to help the evil.

88
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,440
Lord Wu has promised me

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,680
to take her back to Chang'an.

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,610
What condition?

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,560
Li,

92
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
You look pale

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
you don't look good at all.

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,760
I can guess

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,880
Although you have taken over the position of the four Elders,

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,520
your life shouldn’t go well.

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
Before Master Yi passed away,

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,960
I was by her side.

99
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,300
I heard it clearly.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,080
She said the four of them

101
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
to work under Lord Wu.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,200
That’s because Elder Yi

103
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,500
and the other three elders are ruthless.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
But you are

105
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,760
a simple person.

106
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,760
You can't do anything bad.

107
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
In this world,

108
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
not everyone can be a bad person.

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,000
Not everyone can be a good person.

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,880
Even if I submit to Lord Wu,

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
I don't like it.

112
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,000
But when I think of her,

113
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
I had to endure it.

114
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,560
I can only pretend to be obedient.

115
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,880
Now Lord Wu has only one condition.

116
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,440
is to let the Huacai Hall

117
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
to stop opposing the Chamber of Commerce.

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Li,

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
Now Lord Wu proposed

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
to join the Chamber of Commerce.

121
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,440
If you agree,

122
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,360
he will only get worse step by step

123
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,780
and ask for more sizes.

124
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,880
He's holding your mother.

125
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,440
You have no choice but to give in.

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,200
In the end,

127
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,720
you will take the blame for him like others.

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,260
and die a miserable death.

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
If I leave Lord Wu,

130
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,960
where else can I go?

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,640
Master Yi is right.

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,800
As long as you think

133
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,260
If you think it's worth it,

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,200
don't look back.

135
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
Even if

136
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,760
Lord Wu killed me.

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
It's worth it

138
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,320
it's worth it.

139
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,520
Li.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,130
What are you doing? What are you doing?

141
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,880
You guys...

142
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,520
Although Li

143
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
has been the chairman

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
for so many years.

145
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
seems smart,

146
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
but actually,

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,240
he's very naive.

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
He thought in this world,

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,400
as long as you pay off,

150
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,799
I thought it was either black or white.

151
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,960
All these years,

152
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,159
he still doesn't understand

153
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,280
The human heart in this world

154
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,740
is much more complicated than he thinks.

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,160
What else can we do

156
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
to drag him back?

157
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
Find a chance.

158
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
to pull him back.

159
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,960
Otherwise,

160
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
it will be too late

161
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
it will be too late.

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
You're right.

163
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,680
It's simple

164
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
is still very simple.

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
I will protect

166
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,800
and you.

167
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,040
Just think about

168
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,440
how to raise me.

169
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,200
Our

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,960
our latest plan can be officially launched.

171
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,560
Come on.

172
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,330
First of all, let's have a toast. Okay.

173
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,900
All merchants have their own way.

174
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,800
Chang’an is prosperous now.

175
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,600
Our Chamber of Commerce has carefully thought about it.

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
and decided to select

177
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,560
in Chang'an

178
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,440
and set an example for all businesses.

179
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,450
The first choice for trade.

180
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,920
Please recommend yourselves.

181
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,560
The merchants who get the title of COC

182
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,610
will report to the court

183
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,080
and enjoy the grace of His Majesty.

184
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,140
And the Chamber of Commerce will visit you personally.

185
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,660
and put up the plaque for certification.

186
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,320
Good news.

187
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Good news.

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,840
Good news. Good news.

189
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Mo's Rice Shop

190
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,320
and allows the merchants

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
ten dans of fine rice each month.

192
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,960
Lu's Rice Shop

193
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,280
I recommended myself. Although I didn't offer any money,

194
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,600
but it's a hundred mu of land in Gangnam.

195
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
In this way,

196
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,200
give Lu's Rice Shop

197
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,680
to Lu's Rice Shop.

198
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,840
The land in Jiangnan

199
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,480
can be exchanged every year.

200
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,680
are far more than the Chen and Mo family.

201
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
Next, charcoal shop.

202
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,040
Liu’s charcoal shop.

203
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,920
I recommended 2,000 taels of silver.

204
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,400
Wu’s century-old charcoal shop

205
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,720
five thousand taels of silver.

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,560
and promised

207
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,480
the charcoal

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
for His Majesty every year.

209
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,160
More.

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,080
for Lord Wu.

211
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
It's indeed a century-old shop.

212
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,500
You're a sensible person.

213
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
Separation and hatred.

214
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,200
You are the most sensible one among all.

215
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,400
Don't be fooled by

216
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,480
by those people.

217
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,880
I will remember your teachings.

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,720
The Chamber of Commerce certified it is a stupid example of the industry.

219
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,800
This is the way Lord Wu

220
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,440
by Lord Wu.

221
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,480
All merchants with titles

222
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,040
received a huge sum of money.

223
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,840
to Lord Wu.

224
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,890
The Chamber of Commerce

225
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,560
gave a plaque to the merchants who used silver.

226
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,800
while suppressing the merchants who didn't use silver.

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
and stop them from doing business.

228
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,060
and let the merchants who got the title of COC

229
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,320
to raise the price.

230
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,840
In less than ten days,

231
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,040
in less than ten days,

232
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,560
The price has increased by three times. The price has increased.

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
The Chamber of Commerce

234
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,480
Why didn't you

235
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,600
let other traders do business?

236
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,240
and smear it everywhere.

237
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Chen Rice Shop's rice

238
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,080
are all empty rice.

239
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,400
Although the price is low,

240
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
but the price doesn't match.

241
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,080
It's a waste of money.

242
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Rumor has it that

243
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
the oil from Hu's oil shop

244
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,810
is oil from pigs who can get the plague.

245
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
It will kill you.

246
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,700
You're exaggerating.

247
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,560
For the name of the COC,

248
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
every shop needs to be taken care of.

249
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Now many shops

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,080
are completely deficit.

251
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
We have no money

252
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,440
to stop the rumor.

253
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
Plus, the Chamber of Commerce contacted many forces.

254
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
If anyone resists now,

255
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,170
it will be a beating.

256
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,040
In a few days,

257
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
many merchants can't do it anymore.

258
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
They all came to the Carp Alliance

259
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,420
to talk about not renewing the contract.

260
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,200
The suppliers in the clothing store

261
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,080
was beaten up by the Chamber of Commerce.

262
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,610
Recently, they are trying to raise the price.

263
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,680
It's a slight move.

264
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,050
Everyone is having a hard time.

265
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,440
Zheng,

266
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
You're a wise businessman.

267
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
Is there any way to reverse opinions

268
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,640
and support the conscience merchants?

269
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Yes, it is.

270
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,010
But I have to ask my rival

271
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,920
I have to ask my love rival

272
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
Yang Debiao.

273
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,720
That's easy.

274
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,140
You can do it later.

275
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,200
Find Yang Debiao and do something.

276
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,040
Tell me if you need anything.

277
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,920
Go to the East and West Market

278
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,480
and buy 100 portions

279
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,080
from all stores.

280
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,080
Okay.

281
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,280
One hundred for each.

282
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,600
Why did you buy so much?

283
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,200
It's a waste of money.

284
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
That's right, Xiao Zheng.

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,400
You let Brother Xu go to find Miss Yang.

286
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,560
not him.

287
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,440
Take 100 copies of each.

288
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,840
I'm just tired.

289
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,920
You can't take revenge like this.

290
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,440
It's not appropriate.

291
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,920
I know.

292
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,920
Do I look that petty?

293
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
I didn't mean to make things difficult for him.

294
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,840
Just listen to me.

295
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
Awesome!

296
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
Great. Great.

297
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,200
In that case,

298
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,040
you don't have to go personally.

299
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,080
I have many brothers in the Lucky Carp Alliance.

300
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,280
I'm at your disposal.

301
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,220
Yes, Your Highness. Yes, Your Highness.

302
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Hello, Madam Xu, Lord Xu.

303
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,560
This is a free sample for you.

304
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
After using it,

305
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,560
we'll give the actual feedback to our frame master.

306
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,320
We'll come in person

307
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,280
to record your feelings.

308
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,080
Let me tell you.

309
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,480
I used

310
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,610
I used it before.

311
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,840
It's delicate to remove the pollution.

312
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,300
It doesn't hurt your hand.

313
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,680
It's not like the Meng soap certified by the Chamber of Commerce.

314
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
It's expensive and useless.

315
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
It's not clean at all

316
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,800
Except the packaging is better than this

317
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Nothing.

318
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,920
You're right.

319
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
That's right.

320
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,680
The Chamber of Commerce confirmed the vinegar of Heng Ji

321
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,200
is bland like water.

322
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,040
I made a sour plum fish

323
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,400
It's boiled fish.

324
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
The vinegar of Hou is the best vinegar.

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
Pouring a pot of vinegar at home will make you sour for half a year.

326
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,680
Don't exaggerate.

327
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,840
It can be sour for half a year.

328
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,200
Right? Yes.

329
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,280
You know what?

330
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,680
Tell us how you feel

331
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,720
please tell us.

332
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,040
Okay.

333
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,440
This battle is for the country and the people.

334
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,040
For Tang's trade

335
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,530
for the prosperity of our country.

336
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,160
Thank you, students.

337
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
for fighting with De Biao.

338
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,200
We, the scholars of Tang, shall do our best.

339
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Look.

340
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,560
What is this?

341
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,130
It's used for follow-up publicity

342
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,600
and the public opinion statistics.

343
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,440
But we need more people.

344
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,720
Tell me.

345
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,220
Let's try it together.

346
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,320
Dear villagers,

347
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,680
This is the statistics list

348
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,080
of all the people in Chang'an.

349
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,840
After three days and nights,

350
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,820
we can finally announce it today.

351
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,680
The reputation list includes

352
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,960
all kinds of products

353
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,040
and all merchants.

354
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,320
Whether the Chamber of Commerce approves it or not,

355
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,920
will be treated equally.

356
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,560
and be evaluated by the people of Chang'an.

357
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,800
This is good.

358
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,280
Everyone,

359
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,960
The students of the National Education Bureau

360
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,840
of quality and service.

361
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Five is the highest score.

362
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,480
Zero is the lowest score.

363
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,200
The highest score

364
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,060
A conscience merchant who recommends reputation.

365
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,119
I see.

366
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,200
Here's the thing.

367
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,440
The Su’s Mi’s on the top of rice.

368
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,520
4.9 points, full particles.

369
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,440
It's cheap.

370
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Lu's Rice Shop on the blacklist.

371
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,240
0.7. Chen Mi Kongxin.

372
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
The price is evil.

373
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,160
Change.

374
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,480
Chen vinegar's reputation on the list.

375
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Hengshi vinegar.

376
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
4.7. Sour but not bitter.

377
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,680
Sweet and fragrant.

378
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,600
The jealous shop of Hou on the blacklist.

379
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,720
0.7. Boring like water.

380
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,160
Have some water.

381
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
Take a look.

382
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,840
The reputation list is updated on the 15th of every month.

383
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,040
The morning drums

384
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,640
The students of the Imperial Education Bureau

385
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,040
in the way of running a carriage

386
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,200
and spread it evenly in the city

387
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
so that you can buy cheap products.

388
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,240
Our goal is

389
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,440
not to let the people spend more money.

390
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,600
All right.

391
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,980
Red and Black List.

392
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,900
Look over here.

393
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,520
It's certified by Yang's Bamboo Chamber of Commerce.

394
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,000
Sir, come and read some books.

395
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,880
Come on

396
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,200
Come and read the book

397
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
It says

398
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,120
Take a look at Yang's bamboo weapon.

399
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,720
It's certified by the Chamber of Commerce.

400
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,240
recommended by Wu's Beef.

401
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,960
Let's eat.

402
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,480
Let's go.

403
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,840
Go.

404
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,410
Let's go.

405
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,010
Here.

406
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,760
Mr. Bang,

407
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,760
the reputation list.

408
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,280
We paid a lot.

409
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,440
The Chamber of Commerce promised us

410
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
to make us rich.

411
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:06,960
Yes.

412
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,640
Hua Xiao Zheng has been against us.

413
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
How could she fall in love?

414
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,040
She has been in her hands so many times.

415
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,720
Yes.

416
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,240
It's here.

417
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,040
Right

418
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,360
She can't do that.

419
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,160
Otherwise, everyone will...

420
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,640
That's right.

421
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
We can't live anymore.

422
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,160
Tell me.

423
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,620
You have to stand up for us.

424
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
What should we do?

425
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
The merchants

426
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,240
took advantage of the Chamber of Commerce

427
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,640
and got the royal favor,

428
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
but he doesn't do his business well.

429
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,440
He used some dirty tricks

430
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
to cause trouble.

431
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,090
How dare you ask the Chamber of Commerce for justice?

432
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,360
My lord.

433
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
What should we do?

434
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,360
Those scholars in the Imperial Administration

435
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,840
are all from noble families and prestigious families.

436
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,480
The court

437
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,140
needs to win them over.

438
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,300
I can't afford to offend them.

439
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Hua Xiaochi's reputation

440
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
has caught the bugs of the merchants.

441
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,280
Why don't we play along

442
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,610
and give them benefits?

443
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,810
to win them over.

444
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,240
Hua Xiao Zheng

445
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,840
we can only help them promote

446
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
the benefits

447
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,370
from the government

448
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,000
from the government.

449
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,440
You're really good at reasoning.

450
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm flattered.

451
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,980
Your Arei's mother...

452
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
for many years.

453
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,480
My children have already married.

454
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,040
and can't live happily.

455
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,520
You care about me too.

456
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,920
How about

457
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,200
take you as my godson?

458
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,200
What do you think?

459
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,840
That's great.

460
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,440
Godfather,

461
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
please accept my bow.

462
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,680
Good boy.

463
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
Get up.

464
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,160
I can see that

465
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
Hua Xiaochi

466
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,160
you can't let go.

467
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,960
Why don't you make the decision

468
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
and ask the imperial court

469
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,500
and marry her to your mansion?

470
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,240
What do you think?

471
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,600
No, no, no, no.

472
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,680
You love her so much.

473
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,680
why don't you marry her?

474
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,680
She doesn't love me.

475
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,240
It's meaningless to force her to marry her.

476
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,200
I think you're afraid that Xu Ziqi

477
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,640
that Xu Ziqi can't beat him.

478
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,240
I'll help you.

479
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,600
Thank you for your kindness, Godfather.

480
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,440
But I

481
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,600
I don't want to force you to do so. I don't want you to do that. I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself.

482
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,000
You

483
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,280
You look like Xiumei

484
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,170
but you're so soft-hearted

485
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,050
How can you do great things?

486
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,240
Fine.

487
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,920
Go back first.

488
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,720
We'll discuss it later.

489
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,540
I'll leave now.

490
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,100
I'll take my leave.

491
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,400
What an ungrateful man!

492
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
His lordship wants to be his matchmaker.

493
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,680
but he's still unhappy.

494
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Maybe he doesn't want to trouble me.

495
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,880
He likes it in his heart.

496
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,280
Since I took him as my godson,

497
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,920
I have to fulfill his wish.

498
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,840
Takeshi, go!

499
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
Use the best and strongest medicine

500
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,600
to get them done.

501
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,600
No matter

502
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,440
No matter how reluctant he is,

503
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,770
you have to marry my son.

504
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,760
I understand.

505
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,720
Keep a close eye on Xu Ziqi.

506
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
We've been watching him closely.

507
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,240
Don't worry. Let's go. Let's go.

508
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,360
Flower.

509
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,920
A woman?

510
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,000
What kind of painting can she draw with flowers?

511
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,040
Boss.

512
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,680
Boss.

513
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
A pigeon message.

514
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,280
The menu for your dinner is here.

515
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Bring it quickly.

516
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,000
No wonder my sister-in-law doesn't want to be the Oiran.

517
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,640
You're so nice to her.

518
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,360
is 100 times better than the Oiran.

519
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,330
Famous prostitute?

520
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,640
Woman.

521
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,840
Flower.

522
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,460
Look. Look. It's here.

523
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,440
Look. Look. Look. Look.

524
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Look at her. She's here. She's here.

525
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,860
Famous prostitute portrait?

526
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,880
So the four Elders

527
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
is hiding the ledger here.

528
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,600
Slow down.

529
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,880
Hurry up, you two.

530
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,240
The curfew is coming.

531
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,860
Where's Zheng?

532
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,680
Zheng!

533
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,960
Zheng!

534
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,120
Zheng!

535
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,520
Zheng!

536
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,610
What happened to Zheng?

537
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,700
Xiao Zheng is missing.

538
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,680
What happened?

539
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,360
I heard there are many flower picking thieves nearby.

540
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,160
Maybe

541
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,680
He's been kidnapped. He's not here yet. He's here.

542
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Yang Lin Husppy

543
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
Go find him. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

544
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,880
Yes.

545
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,820
Let's split up.

546
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,680
Let's go.

547
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,240
Xiao Zheng.

548
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,480
Zheng!

549
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,480
Xiao Zheng!

550
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,400
Hua Xiaotong

551
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,240
Xiao Zheng!

552
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,440
Zheng!

553
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,840
Zheng!

554
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Let this girl go.

555
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,290
I'll give you a lot of money.

556
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,880
Look.

557
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,680
My lord.

558
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,960
Leave us.

559
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,300
Sir, something bad happened!

560
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,520
The four Elders

561
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,200
might leave you a big trouble.

562
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,000
I was watching at the delinquents' camp.

563
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,840
Xu Ziqi

564
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,240
It's Xu Ziqi.

565
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,000
four people were found

566
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,660
left behind a ledger of the Chamber of Commerce.

567
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,040
The ledger?

568
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:40,840
Yes.

569
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,720
I don’t know what will be recorded in the ledger.

570
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,760
But I think

571
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
Since the four Elders hid it from you,

572
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,840
from you,

573
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,770
It won't be a good thing.

574
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,360
What they want to hide

575
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,120
must be something that can save their lives.

576
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
It's something that will kill me.

577
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
My lord, I'll go find the ledger now.

578
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,440
Keep a close eye on Xu Ziqi.

579
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,160
and get the ledger back immediately.

580
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,000
even if it costs your life.

581
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,520
Xu Ziqi is so skilled.

582
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
You fool.

583
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,680
If he can't hand over the ledger,

584
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,840
you must die.

585
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,360
Die with me.

586
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,680
I will risk my life

587
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,440
to find the ledger.

588
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,400
Get lost!

589
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,720
Yes.

590
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,000
What are you doing here?

591
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,720
What's going on?

592
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Zheng!

593
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,880
Zheng!

594
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
Separating hatred.

595
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
Are you okay?

596
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,360
You...

597
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,040
Xiao Zheng.

598
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,650
Separating hatred.

599
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,760
Wake up.

600
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,680
The entry record of the city gate is clear.

601
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,720
No problem.

602
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,240
There was no problem with the pharmacy.

603
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
That's why the smell

604
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,440
in the sedan.

605
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,040
I also let the hunting dog identify it.

606
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,970
the combination of several drugs.

607
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,680
It can only be an emotional drug.

608
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,160
Yes.

609
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,120
Lord Wu would never be so stupid

610
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,520
to tie them up in the city.

611
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,880
There are too many eyes.

612
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,210
It's easy to be exposed.

613
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,500
With Lord Wu's method,

614
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,280
he will transfer them

615
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,240
after we succeed.

616
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,700
before negotiating or killing them.

617
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,160
But...

618
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,080
how can two living people

619
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,500
get out of the city?

620
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,970
won't attract everyone's attention.

621
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Could it be...

622
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
[A Vessel?]

623
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,840
Zuicheng 9.

624
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,610
There's only one possibility.

625
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,680
There are escorts.

626
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,440
There's a container. You don't need to use the tube when you go out.

627
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,960
It can be sold at any time.

628
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,770
The only thing that won't arouse suspicion is...

629
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,040
Zheng.

630
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,520
Do you know

631
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,600
I've always liked you.

632
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,760
For you, I even went against the Chamber of Commerce.

633
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,120
For you,

634
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,360
for you.

635
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,440
But why?

636
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,360
Why did you choose Ziqi?

637
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Separate hatred.

638
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,840
Calm down.

639
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,040
If you do something out of line,

640
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,680
Xu Ziqi won't let you go.

641
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,760
Calm down.

642
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,040
Xu Ziqi.

643
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,680
Ziqi

644
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,240
is my best friend.

645
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,960
But...

646
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,060
why did he take away the woman I love the most?

647
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,610
Separation hatred.

648
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
The wheel mark stopped here.

649
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,360
It must be nearby.

650
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,680
Hurry, let's split up.

651
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,240
Do you want me to assign someone to you?

652
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,040
No.

653
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,040
I'm going to tear this bastard apart.

654
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,440
I'm so hot.

655
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Separate hatred.

656
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,960
Calm down.

657
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,760
I'm sick.

658
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,760
Calm down.

659
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,280
Calm down.

660
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
No, I'm sick.

661
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,160
I feel so bad.

662
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,960
Zheng

663
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,120
Zheng!

664
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,760
Zheng!

665
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,680
Zheng!

666
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,000
Go away!

667
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,240
Fang Li, calm down.

668
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Separate hatred.

669
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,440
Calm down.

670
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,160
Calm down.

671
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680
Wake up.

672
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,640
Separate hatred

673
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,400
Xiao Zheng.

674
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Are you okay?

675
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,680
Fang Li Hen said his medicine has improved.

676
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,240
He kept bumping his head.

677
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,040
Look, his head is broken.

678
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,300
Hurry and knock me out.

679
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,300
No matter what,

680
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,740
no matter what.

681
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,440
I can't control myself.

682
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,640
It's okay.

683
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,960
It's okay.

684
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,960
It's all my fault.

685
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,320
Even if you...

686
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,200
Xiao Zheng, if you want to kill me,

687
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,880
or Ziqi, if you want to sue me,

688
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,360
I have no objections.

689
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,200
Get up, Ban Li.

690
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,400
Although

691
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
a flower thief,

692
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
I started it.

693
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,330
But I couldn't control myself.

694
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
I can't blame others.

695
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,960
Do you know who the flower thief is?

696
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Separating hatred.

697
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,920
It's not your fault.

698
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,440
Blame that heartless man.

699
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,960
for killing a thousand times and going to hell.

700
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,290
and never reincarnate.

701
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,680
Lord Wu.

702
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,360
You hit your head.

703
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,860
You didn't even touch Xiao Zheng.

704
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
That flower-picking thief

705
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,480
is Lord Wu's butler, Wu Si.

706
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,440
When he tied me up,

707
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,200
I bit his left hand.

708
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,280
Xu Ziqi went to investigate.

709
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
His left hand.

710
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,440
on his left hand.

711
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,720
Lord Wu didn't hide it.

712
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,200
He said it was for your own good.

713
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,880
I thought you two were successful.

714
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,440
and you were quite proud.

715
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,600
Li,

716
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Now you know

717
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,880
what we were talking about.

718
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,340
I don't want to be a bad guy.

719
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,120
I just want

720
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,960
to get my mother back.

721
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,040
In order to force him to surrender,

722
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,900
to force him to surrender.

723
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,920
How can you say you're a good person

724
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
How can you say you're a good person?

725
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,120
I heard

726
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,480
Lord Wu has accepted you as his adopted son.

727
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,080
He will definitely force you as father and son.

728
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,640
What should you do then?

729
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,540
If Zheng really loses integrity,

730
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,120
you are the one who threatens me.

731
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,920
In order to use you two,

732
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,840
to use you two.

733
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,680
You're just a piece that can be left behind.

734
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,500
Don't you understand?

735
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,120
I've been investigating this matter

736
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,040
to investigate this matter for over two years.

737
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,700
The court has tried many means

738
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,120
to arrest and punish him.

739
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,960
He ran away every time.

740
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,440
There are dozens of people

741
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,280
for him every year.

742
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,960
You knew I had no choice,

743
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,040
but you always go against me.

744
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,960
Li.

745
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,640
Trust me.

746
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,970
Hiding my identity from you

747
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,000
is the hardest thing I've ever done.

748
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,460
And Hua Xiao Zheng.

749
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,360
You know I love Xiao Zheng.

750
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,410
but you still...

751
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,760
You can't blame me for this. You can't blame me for this.

752
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
It's not your fault.

753
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,420
I have the right to like Zheng.

754
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
You too.

755
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,440
How can I

756
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,960
force my sworn brother

757
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,000
to give up being with him.

758
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,960
It's the same.

759
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,639
I can't let the court down

760
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,440
because you are my sworn brother.

761
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
and the people.

762
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,960
In the past,

763
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
we were so close.

764
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,639
Why are we

765
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,760
gradually

766
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,920
Every time I think about this,

767
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,960
I feel

768
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,560
a little sour.

769
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,290
Is it because of Hua Xiaochi

770
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,170
or the Chamber of Commerce?

771
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,220
No matter how I think about it,

772
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,720
I can't figure it out.

773
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,760
At first,

774
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,080
at the beginning.

775
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,600
I used you to let me stay in Chang'an first.

776
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,800
It's my fault.

777
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,960
Actually,

778
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,360
when you sent me back to the mansion,

779
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,640
I woke up in a trance.

780
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,040
Now that I think about it,

781
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,800
it was you

782
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,320
hugged her tight.

783
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,320
Breath in pain

784
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
without any fear.

785
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,280
In my memory,

786
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,440
Xiao Zheng is in front of me.

787
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,600
sometimes smart

788
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,840
Sometimes lively

789
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,720
and sometimes diligent.

790
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,120
and sometimes smart.

791
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,280
But

792
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,400
you've never cried in my arms.

793
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,800
That's why I knew Ziqi

794
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,760
you are the one

795
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,320
who I want to rely on the most.

796
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,720
These

797
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,130
I didn't understand it before.

798
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,880
You taught me.

799
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,920
If people think of someone,

800
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,440
is not entirely shining.

801
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,440
What's more,

802
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,920
show your weakness

803
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,560
to each other.

804
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,240
And you

805
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,400
[You were]

806
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,040
was me.

807
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,140
who I want to reveal without hesitation.

808
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,220
My room is full of resentment.

809
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,440
is a proud person.

810
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,300
I may be a lowly person,

811
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,730
but I don't want to be self-abased.

812
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,500
When you do things,

813
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,000
Lift your head

814
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,620
Straighten your back.

815
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,400
It's you.

816
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,640
Hua Xiaochi

817
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
You make me feel bending down

818
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,560
laughing with you

819
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,050
is the happiest thing in the world.

820
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,360
But maybe

821
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,960
Fate

822
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,920
is so wonderful.

823
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,000
But I found

824
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,560
my happiness

825
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,120
makes me feel

826
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,640
that I can't

827
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,520
I can't have it.

828
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Separate hatred.

829
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,840
You're a very good person.

830
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,840
You will find

831
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,280
a girl you like.

832
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,320
these words

833
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,400
are not harmful.

834
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,760
It's very insulting.

835
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,280
Will you? Yes.

836
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,210
If you weren't my woman,

837
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,690
I would have beaten you for my brother.

838
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,520
But besides that,

839
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,760
I don't know what I can say.

840
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,800
What I say now is meaningless.

841
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,040
It's just an illusion

842
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,040
in the past.

843
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,160
Let's move on.

844
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,440
Let's move on.

845
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
How?

846
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,600
Everything is ready.

847
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,640
The karma is true.

848
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,980
Since we can't move on,

849
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,320
let's do it again.

850
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,700
My name is Hua Xiaochi.

851
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,160
I came to Chang'an for no reason.

852
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,480
One was poor and two white.

853
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,740
started from scratch.

854
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,360
and established a clothing brand, Huacai Hall.

855
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,320
Now I'm a rich woman.

856
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,960
I like eating, sleeping, walking and making money.

857
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,780
You're out of control.

858
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,720
You're good at cheating people.

859
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,480
Excuse me,

860
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
what's your name?

861
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,920
Hello, my name is Xu Ziqi.

862
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,840
The former leader of the rebels in Chang'an

863
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,880
He was also a spy who was exposed.

864
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,440
He's good at using weapons.

865
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,240
My dream is to find a rich woman.

866
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,960
has come true.

867
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,170
The biggest problem now

868
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,520
is to find evidence that the Chamber of Commerce cheated.

869
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
The most important evidence now

870
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,040
The ledger.

871
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,160
I...

872
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,760
is called "Separation of hatred".

873
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
After a sinner,

874
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,920
Right.

875
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,080
The former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

876
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,920
Currently,

877
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
I'm afraid

878
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,800
without a home.

879
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,700
That house really killed Hua Xiaochi

880
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,720
That voice

881
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,780
is very miserable.

882
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,720
Your medicine is really amazing.

883
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,800
In the process,

884
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,810
was interrupted by Xu Ziqi.

885
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,890
and hurt several of his men.

886
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
I didn't do my job well.

887
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,640
Please punish me.

888
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
What punishment?

889
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,130
It's not your fault.

890
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,600
It's weird that Xu Ziqi suddenly appeared.

891
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Go.

892
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
Catch him.

893
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,880
Go! Go! Go!

894
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,000
Then,

895
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,440
Let's eat.

896
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,160
This...

897
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,440
Is it Xu Ziqi?

898
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,520
Do you remember a few months ago,

899
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,000
Xu Ziqi almost killed

900
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,130
almost killed all foreign assassins.

901
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,960
I didn't expect

902
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,880
Xu Ziqi has improved a lot over the years.

903
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,700
Then arrest Hua Xiao Zheng

904
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,800
as a threat.

905
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,940
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

906
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,080
Thank you for your hard work.

907
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,320
You've travelled so far in the morning.

908
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,280
Here, have some water.

909
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,040
Where is Xiao Zheng?

910
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,960
I've heard a lot about you.

911
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I finally see you today.

912
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,440
You are really handsome.

913
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,330
Thank you for the wine, Lord Wu.

914
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,100
I'll use this wine to sacrifice heaven and earth today.

915
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,760
Where did Godfather take Xiao Zheng?

916
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,700
The bamboo forest in this city

917
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,610
has the fragrance of green grass and wood bamboo.

918
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,600
is the best morning light in this day.

919
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,760
I wanted to talk to you.

920
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,160
I didn't expect Lord Xu to be so impatient.

921
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,800
Then come with me to see Hua Xiao Zheng.

922
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Xiao Zheng.

923
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,040
Let me finish.

924
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,640
before you save him.

925
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,440
Zheng.

926
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,240
You don't have to disturb her dream.

927
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,040
She was fed medicine.

928
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,360
She won't wake up soon.

929
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,360
You kidnapped Xiao Zheng

930
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,920
just to threaten me.

931
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,440
What do you want?

932
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,080
Tell me.

933
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,010
Change the song.

934
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,620
The song of South Wind.

935
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,980
Let's go! Let's go!

936
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,240
Stop!

937
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,800
Don't move.

938
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,280
I'll kill Hua

939
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,600
What do you want?

940
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,320
The ledger of the Chamber of Commerce.

941
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,920
I don't know the ledger of the Chamber of Commerce.

942
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,040
Mr. Xu, you're not honest.

943
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,600
I know about the ledger.

944
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,040
I don't want to beat around the bush.

945
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,240
This ledger is the only one

946
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,760
You can bring it out.

947
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,320
It's fine if you don't admit it.

948
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,760
I'll tell you now.

949
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,960
You must find a ledger from the Chamber of Commerce

950
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,090
in exchange for Hua Xiao Zheng's life.

951
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,400
This matter...

952
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,440
Lord Xu,

953
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,960
You have no choice.

954
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,840
Bury him now!

955
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,220
I want to marry Hua Xiao Zheng.

956
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,880
What?

957
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,940
Hua Xiao Zheng and I are intimate.

958
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,440
I can't let her go.

959
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,900
Please don't kill her.

960
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,620
Godfather.

961
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,440
I promise you with my life.

962
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,720
After marrying Hua Xiao Zheng,

963
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,000
I'll make him

964
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,960
to serve you wholeheartedly.

965
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,490
How could you be so foolish?

966
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,440
This woman is your intimate friend.

967
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
she still goes out with other men.

968
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,040
You don't care.

969
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I don't care.

970
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,120
I only care about Xiao Zheng.

971
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,440
If Xiao Zheng dies,

972
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,400
I don't want to live anymore.

973
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,160
You useless thing!

974
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,890
I beg you not to kill Xiao Zheng.

975
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,290
Please, Godfather.

976
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
Stop burying him.

977
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,120
Takeshi!

978
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,600
Stop. Stop burying it.

979
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,220
Thank you, Godfather.

980
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,360
This woman...

981
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,920
I won't kill her.

982
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,520
Just marry me if you want.

983
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,240
But you useless thing.

984
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,120
Go home and reflect on yourself.

985
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,120
If you keep being emotional,

986
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,440
I won't let you stay.

987
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,480
Thank you, Godfather.

988
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:22,940
Xiao Zheng.

989
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,620
Xiao Zheng.

990
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,960
Lord Xu.

991
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,080
Whether we can get married

992
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,480
depends on you.

993
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,960
If I bring the ledger,

994
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,920
if I bring the ledger?

995
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,840
No.

996
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,300
You brought the ledger

997
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,280
to save them.

998
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,440
Don't think I can't tell

999
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,960
That room broke up to save Hua Xiao Zheng.

1000
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,320
to save Hua Xiao Zheng.

1001
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,840
Such an idiot.

1002
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,010
It's useless for me to keep him.

1003
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,610
Why don't I use it to threaten you, Lord Xu?

1004
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,440
Bring back the ledger in seven days.

1005
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,360
Otherwise, the wedding will be the end of them.
