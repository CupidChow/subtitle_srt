1
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,880
Five.

2
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,160
Three.

3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,600
Two.

4
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,640
That

5
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
bad person

6
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,000
is so polite.

7
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Who's there?

8
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,640
Boss,

9
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
it's me,

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,639
Tu Da.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,960
Brother.

12
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
Brother, are you alright?

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,079
You guys,

14
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,810
are you okay?

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,400
You scared me to death!

16
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,960
You were going to push me into the water, weren't you?

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,640
And fighting against the whole world.

18
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,360
Why don't you say you'll sacrifice your heart for the Tang Dynasty?

19
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Sir Xu, we were ordered to protect your safety.

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
But your bottom

21
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,540
is almost beaten to a pulp.

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,660
I won't disturb you two brothers.

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
We'd better stay out of this.

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,680
Well...

25
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,400
We're all brothers here.

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Who would care about such things?

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Besides,

28
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,320
the only one who can beat our boss

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,800
is Miss Xiaofei.

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760
No one else is allowed.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,240
Stop!

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,640
You...

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,400
Xiaofei...

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,560
Her Majesty has sent orders.

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
We must receive them.

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,900
Her Majesty commands:

37
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
Master Xu's identity has been exposed.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Enemies will surely come seeking revenge.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Until the master's safety is secured,

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
we must protect him at all times.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,520
The master is a pillar of the state.

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
We cannot allow him to suffer

43
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
even the slightest harm.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:33,960
Right.

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Her Majesty only ordered us to defend against outside threats.

46
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
As for domestic violence,

47
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,240
we

48
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,210
will not interfere.

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,360
With so many skilled people protecting me,

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
my safety

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,140
shouldn't be an issue, right?

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480
Her Majesty has sent

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,980
half of her strongest fighters here at once.

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,890
Your safety should be guaranteed now.

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Now you need to swear

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,240
in front of everyone

57
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,220
that you'll never leave me again.

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
I...

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,480
Never mind. I won't curse you.

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,640
Xiaofei.

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
From now on,

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,640
I absolutely

63
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,890
will never leave you again.

64
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
Stop staring.

65
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,760
Jinjin.

66
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,000
Jin'er.

67
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,880
C-come out.

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
I need to talk to you.

69
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,880
I'm here.

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Jin'er, I...

71
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,880
I...

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,440
I need to talk to you.

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
Of course.

74
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
It's a long story,

75
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,320
but we can keep it brief.

76
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,360
I...

77
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,200
I can't...

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,680
Stop.

79
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Are you...

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
going to propose?

81
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,440
Why are you so passionate

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,320
when confessing your love to me,

83
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
but so hesitant about proposing?

84
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,000
Jin'er.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,200
Before,

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,460
no matter how many times I told you I love you,

87
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,760
I knew

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
you wouldn't respond to me.

89
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,440
So

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,080
I could say it boldly with a smile,

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,140
without worrying about the outcome.

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
But now,

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
I can feel

94
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,640
you have feelings for me,

95
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,680
with hope and trust.

96
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,740
So I don't want to let you down.

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,560
Jin'er, you

98
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
are the best woman in the world.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm afraid I can't be

100
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
a man you can rely on.

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,340
What are you really afraid of?

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm afraid of so many things.

103
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm afraid I can't spend my life with you.

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,760
I'm afraid our feelings might change.

105
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,159
I'm afraid I can't protect you completely.

106
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,010
The more I think, the more scared I get.

107
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,890
Before coming here,

108
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,740
I spent the whole day fishing.

109
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,640
I thought the river god's blessing

110
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,380
would give me courage.

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,080
But I've noticed

112
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
Do you think Miss Jiner will accept?

113
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,020
It doesn't matter anyway.

114
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,200
Hard to say.

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
When other men propose,

116
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,800
they can't wait to make grand promises.

117
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,960
I think she'll accept.

118
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,760
They certainly try to trick

119
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,360
the girl into nodding with tears of gratitude.

120
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
But when you propose,

121
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,760
you insist on telling all the frightening things.

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,440
Jiner,

123
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,680
if I can marry you,

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
it's not a momentary impulse but a lifelong commitment.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,440
I dare not be careless.

126
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,320
Are you willing?

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,960
You don't want to.

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,800
I'm just amazed

129
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
that the man I've fallen in love with

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,200
is so forthright and honest.

131
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,440
Jiner, did you say

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,720
you love me?

133
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,440
Zhang Guicai,

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
I've never met a man like you.

135
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,200
You're kind and righteous,

136
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
willing to go through fire and water for love,

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,260
never expecting anything in return.

138
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,800
In my life as Gu Jiner,

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I've seen so many men,

140
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,680
but only you truly accept me,

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
protect me,

142
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,040
come close to me and warm me.

143
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,080
So,

144
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,480
now

145
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,800
I want to ask you,

146
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,920
may I

147
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,080
be your wife?

148
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
I do want you, Gu Jiner,

149
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,920
to be my only wife,

150
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
in this life,

151
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,080
in every life,

152
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560
for all eternity.

153
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
As for those unknowns you mentioned,

154
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,600
the fears,

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,260
it doesn't matter.

156
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,020
We'll face them together.

157
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Gu Jin'er,

158
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
will you marry me?

159
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,080
Wait.

160
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,300
Instructor Xue is coming.

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,400
You need to

162
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,480
stand up.

163
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Zhang Guicai.

164
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,960
These

165
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,800
are the dowry I've prepared for Jin'er.

166
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,680
Don't think she's all alone

167
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
and you can bully her.

168
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,200
This is her family home.

169
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,440
I

170
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
am her family.

171
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,410
You came to me when you were six.

172
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I never thought of

173
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,800
raising you as a cash cow.

174
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,800
My greatest wish

175
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,160
is for you to marry a good man.

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
So many men come and go.

177
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,960
Only Zhang Guicai

178
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,720
would make me feel at ease giving you to him.

179
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,500
For these 14 years,

180
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,880
I haven't spent a penny of what you earned here.

181
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,100
I've been waiting for this day

182
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,200
when you'd find a reliable man

183
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,560
and take it all with you as your dowry.

184
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,960
Teacher.

185
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,330
Everything I say

186
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,050
is for your own good.

187
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm strict with you

188
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,040
because I fear you might choose the wrong husband.

189
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,440
I don't want you getting close to Young Master Fang

190
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,560
because he simply

191
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
isn't worthy of your lifelong commitment.

192
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,840
But now I can rest easy.

193
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,440
Zhang Guicai.

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,480
I'm entrusting my most precious treasure.

195
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,620
I'm leaving her in your hands.

196
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,560
Please take good care of her, will you?

197
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,440
Don't worry.

198
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,810
I'll definitely take good care of Jin'er.

199
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
These are all things I wanted to do for you.

200
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,210
All these years,

201
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,160
you've earned so much face for me.

202
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
This is what you deserve.

203
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,860
Don't feel like you don't deserve it.

204
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,650
Take these with you to start your new life.

205
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
You'll have confidence.

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
Between us,

207
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,930
there's no such thing as who owes whom.

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
What are you standing there for?

209
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,560
Help your wife!

210
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,960
Jin'er.

211
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,890
You don't need to kneel before me anymore.

212
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
You're a free person now.

213
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,160
I'm no longer your instructor Xue.

214
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,960
Alright.

215
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,010
On such a wonderful day,

216
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
no more crying.

217
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,290
Your makeup will run and ruin your beauty.

218
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,680
It's so beautiful.

219
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
I promise you,

220
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,480
once you're safe,

221
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,930
I'll propose to you even more formally than this.

222
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,800
Look! Look!

223
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,560
This is truly a feeling of loneliness.

224
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
This...

225
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Master Xu,

226
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,200
we've been ordered to protect your safety.

227
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,800
We fear your enemies might seek revenge.

228
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,560
Today we've discussed many things with our Buliangren brothers.

229
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,360
First, we need to clarify who all your enemies are.

230
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,560
The palace has provided a file memo.

231
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,680
Tonight, we request that you join us

232
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,720
to mark the locations of your enemies on the map,

233
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,320
and draft another list of potential assailants.

234
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,650
Better safe than sorry.

235
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,920
What's wrong?

236
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,720
I have quite a few enemies.

237
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,440
How many? A lot?

238
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,320
Five? Ten?

239
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Jiading.

240
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,160
Have the camp bring the Wuxu Cabinet files.

241
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,800
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,680
Go.

243
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,080
So many!

244
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,120
There's more?

245
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
Can't help it.

246
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm too good at what I do.

247
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,480
Categorize

248
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,210
and mark quickly on the map.

249
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,560
Let's do it.

250
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,320
Mr. Xu,

251
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
you're impressive!

252
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,440
Taking down all of Chang'an.

253
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,440
I think

254
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
there's no need to organize this at all.

255
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Boss, do you remember?

256
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
For example, this is Chang'an City,

257
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,130
and this around Chang'an is called

258
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,080
Fusang.

259
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,840
You've already taken down half of Fusang.

260
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,680
That country

261
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,540
isn't very big anyway.

262
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Sir, things have come to this point.

263
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,599
Danger is everywhere,

264
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,760
threats in everything.

265
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,440
It seems we must stay close

266
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,700
to protect you, Mr. Xu.

267
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,280
We can't have them following us forever

268
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,339
and protecting us.

269
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
No matter how closely they follow,

270
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,960
they'll get drowsy,

271
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,619
need the bathroom, or get headaches sometimes.

272
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,819
What else can we do?

273
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,120
The people in Chang'an who know you, Xu Ziqi, are a good official

274
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,880
need to increase in number.

275
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,720
Mr. Xu is surrounded by enemies and targeted by villains.

276
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,360
We scholars

277
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,360
can only do three things for him.

278
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
First, write a biography for Mr. Xu.

279
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
'The Biography of Xu Ziqi, Descendant of the Loyal and Good.'

280
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,120
Let those hiding in Chang'an,

281
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,200
those villains who want to harm Mr. Xu,

282
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,660
know of Mr. Xu's goodness.

283
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,200
Make them abandon their assassination plans.

284
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,440
Good.

285
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,960
Kill Xu Ziqi

286
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,040
to avenge my father.

287
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,480
Kill Xu Ziqi

288
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
to avenge my father.

289
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,240
No, you can't kill him!

290
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,560
You mustn't kill him!

291
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
Mr. Xu is a good man!

292
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,840
It was our father who was the Tuyuhun spy,

293
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,760
who betrayed the Great Tang.

294
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,360
We can't fail to distinguish right from wrong.

295
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,280
What did you say?

296
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,610
Take a look at this book.

297
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,960
We should be descendants of the loyal and good.

298
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,720
We need to become Buliang warriors

299
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,680
like Lord Xu

300
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,480
and dedicate our hearts to protect the Tang Dynasty.

301
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,960
We need to become Buliang warriors.

302
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,160
Second point.

303
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
All weapons from nearby blacksmiths

304
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,520
will be discounted these days

305
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,960
so every citizen can afford

306
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
suitable weapons

307
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,820
to join the battle at any time.

308
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,440
Protect the honorable Master Xu.

309
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
Protect the honorable Master Xu.

310
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
Protect the honorable Master Xu.

311
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,440
Third,

312
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,280
if anyone attempts to assassinate Master Xu in our presence,

313
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,400
we shall risk our lives

314
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,060
to ensure Master Xu's safety.

315
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,850
Master Xu Ziqi's family has been loyal for generations,

316
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,000
sacrificing three generations for our great Tang Dynasty.

317
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,600
We must not let Master Xu die in vain.

318
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
We can't die in vain.

319
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,880
Protect Master Xu!

320
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Protect Master Xu!

321
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,240
Cucumbers!

322
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,640
-Come and see!
-Look!

323
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,680
Fresh cucumbers!

324
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Cucumbers!

325
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
Assassin!

326
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,240
There's an assassin!

327
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Let's have stir-fried cucumbers tonight.

328
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,480
Run!

329
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,760
Let's see how far you can run.

330
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,240
Why did you stop running?

331
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,100
Who goes there?

332
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,130
State your name.

333
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,280
Bastard!

334
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,610
What gibberish is he speaking?

335
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Get down!

336
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
Assassin!

337
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,160
Catch him!

338
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,360
There's an assassin!

339
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,480
Mr. Xu.

340
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Xu.

341
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,160
Thank you all for your hard work.

342
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,040
Not at all.

343
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,440
Not at all.

344
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,720
Your Majesty, regarding Mr. Xu's matter,

345
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
I didn't have to deploy a single soldier.

346
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,960
The citizens of Chang'an rose up on their own

347
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,160
and caught all the assassins in one sweep.

348
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,120
It seems good deeds are still rewarded in this world.

349
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,800
The people rising to protect a loyal official -

350
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,280
this is what I

351
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,120
have always hoped to see in a prosperous era.

352
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,920
These citizens,

353
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
they distinguish right from wrong, loyal from treacherous,

354
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,840
and are willing to risk their lives to protect the virtuous.

355
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,240
Our Princess Taiping

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,360
will surely live in an era of peace and prosperity.

357
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,160
Your Majesty is right. Look.

358
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,280
Kill!

359
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,650
Look at this.

360
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,090
This ball is decent.

361
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,280
This one...

362
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,360
This won't work.

363
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,680
Let me change it.

364
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
It's quite light.

365
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,440
How's everything going?

366
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,040
Chief, for fifteen consecutive days,

367
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,400
Chang'an has captured

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,960
1,649 assassins in total.

369
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,200
After interrogating each one,

370
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,720
Chief,

371
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,520
we've basically cleared out all your enemies.

372
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
What's your next plan?

373
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,840
Tu Da,

374
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
move there.

375
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,640
Everything's done.

376
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,480
Those civilians,

377
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,680
they're even more enthusiastic about catching assassins than we are.

378
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,740
They catch nearly a hundred each day.

379
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,280
The prison is almost full.

380
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
That's good.

381
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,620
You don't have to hang around me all day anymore.

382
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,200
You can go do things you want to do.

383
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,000
Being stuck in one place is boring.

384
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,880
Mr. Xu,

385
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,840
we enjoy following Miss Xiaofei.

386
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,280
Besides, she has taught us a lot.

387
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,940
You don't understand.

388
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,780
I'm already being so tactful.

389
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,840
You really think you're being productive?

390
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,640
All day wasting time with trivial pursuits.

391
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,440
Not behaving like Jinwu Guards at all.

392
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,640
Go back and practice your martial arts.

393
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,640
Come on,

394
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,570
everyone gather up!

395
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Really...

396
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,120
Brothers,

397
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,650
General Qin,

398
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,180
before departing,

399
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,060
I have something important to do.

400
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,660
The other enemies were not my personal foes.

401
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,400
But the one who burned down my house

402
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,060
I must capture him myself.

403
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,770
Alright.

404
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,120
Xiaofei, I'll be right back.

405
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,160
Be careful.

406
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,600
Let's go.

407
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,400
Move.

408
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,840
Isn't this a victory?

409
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,940
I really don't understand

410
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
what your men were thinking.

411
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
Every sword used to assassinate me

412
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,140
has 'Xing' engraved on it,

413
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,820
and they even kept receipts in duplicate from the blacksmith.

414
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,360
So what if it was me?

415
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,280
I'll make you pay for this.

416
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,170
All for Hua Xiaofei,

417
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,960
that slut.

418
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,520
You filthy scum.

419
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Take him to prison

420
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,900
to await judgment from the Ministry of Justice.

421
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,560
I don't have enough evidence

422
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
to prove that you three were also involved.

423
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
We certainly weren't, Magistrate Xu.

424
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,200
When we heard about your incident,

425
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,530
our hearts were broken.

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,530
You are our local official,

427
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,000
how could we possibly harm you?

428
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,200
Exactly.

429
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,440
You've brought so many people here.

430
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,600
Kill us if you want.

431
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,840
It's up to you.

432
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
I've already told you

433
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
I have no evidence to arrest you.

434
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
You can still remain in the chamber of commerce.

435
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,480
I can prove it.

436
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,440
The other three elders are also involved in this matter.

437
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,900
They can all be thrown into prison together.

438
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,360
Master Xu, it's been a while.

439
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,960
Fang Lihen.

440
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
I've always treated you well.

441
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,410
Why are you turning against me?

442
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,280
Ali.

443
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,620
Are you going to expose the chamber's wrongdoings?

444
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,540
I will testify.

445
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,440
The assassination attempt against Master Xu

446
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
was a conspiracy by the Four Elders.

447
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,640
Arrest them!

448
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,120
The Four Elders

449
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,960
had long found Master Xu irritating

450
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,780
and felt they could never gain his trust.

451
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,640
They feared he would make accusations based on rumors

452
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,840
and disrupt the guild's normal operations.

453
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,170
Furthermore, Master Xu

454
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,920
had multiple previous conflicts with the guild,

455
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,120
planting the seeds of discord long ago.

456
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,480
Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce has decided

457
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,940
to assassinate Master Xu.

458
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,120
I knew it.

459
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,720
All these years, you've been nothing but an ungrateful wolf.

460
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,000
I never thought that you, this little lamb,

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
would be capable of such a thing.

462
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,160
The descendant of a criminal official

463
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,360
is nothing but trash.

464
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,480
This will destroy our Chamber of Commerce.

465
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,360
What benefit does this bring you?

466
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,520
What benefit?

467
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,040
You simply want to take my place.

468
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Am I right?

469
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,770
The witness is here.

470
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
I hope you will uphold justice, Mr. Xu

471
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,530
and throw all four elders into prison.

472
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,360
I, Fang Lihen, will testify about the crimes of the four elders

473
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,820
and tell everything I know

474
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,760
without holding anything back.

475
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,440
Mr. Xu.

476
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,240
They were trying to kill you.

477
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,040
How can you show mercy

478
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,720
to those who wanted you dead?

479
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,280
I cannot wrongfully accuse any innocent person

480
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,810
nor can I kill the innocent.

481
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,300
If every official in the Tang Dynasty

482
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,440
ruled based on personal preferences

483
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
and personal grudges,

484
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,970
then the country would fall apart.

485
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,880
Take Elder Xing to prison

486
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,000
to await the Ministry of Justice's verdict.

487
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,660
As for the other three elders,

488
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,200
take them to the magistrate's office first,

489
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,660
and after interrogation,

490
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,120
we will decide their fate.

491
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,920
Yes.

492
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,060
Take them away.

493
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,640
Fang Lihen,

494
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,480
remember.

495
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,080
Li.

496
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,640
Now that the four elders have lost their power,

497
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,480
you might as well surrender.

498
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,520
Tell us everything the guild has done

499
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
over these years.

500
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,600
This way,

501
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,160
you might have a chance to redeem yourself.

502
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,120
I will petition the court to protect you

503
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
and bring your parents back to Chang'an soon.

504
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,640
When I heard you died from poisoning,

505
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,440
I felt

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,240
extremely sad.

507
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,160
In Chang'an,

508
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,920
you were my only brother.

509
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
I thought,

510
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,530
if you were really gone,

511
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
I would truly be

512
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,760
all alone.

513
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,860
But unexpectedly,

514
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,440
you faked your death.

515
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,760
And I knew nothing about it from beginning to end.

516
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,040
Because of my identity as an imperial detective,

517
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,570
I couldn't tell anyone about faking my death.

518
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,290
You investigated the guild as a secret agent.

519
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,930
While investigating the guild by my side,

520
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,690
did you truly see me as a brother

521
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,360
or were you just using me?

522
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,290
If you were using me,

523
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
you certainly treated me very well.

524
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,200
But if you considered me a brother,

525
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,260
why did you never consider things from my perspective?

526
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Xu Ziqi,

527
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,880
I can no longer trust you.

528
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,420
Now that all four elders have been captured,

529
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,480
you've gotten what you wanted.

530
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,600
From now on,

531
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
the guild's affairs,

532
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,440
my affairs,

533
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,200
stay out of all of it.

534
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Ali! Ali!

535
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,200
Sir,

536
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,170
must you really do this?

537
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,960
Right now,

538
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,000
I can only pledge my allegiance to Master Wu.

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,260
Master Wu loves money.

540
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,160
If I don't offer him some wealth,

541
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,240
how will he know I'm obedient enough?

542
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,080
That I'm capable enough?

543
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,050
How would he let me replace the four elders

544
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,880
and truly control the guild?

545
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,040
But, but this is too much, sir!

546
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,120
Sir,

547
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,440
how can you put all your chips

548
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,440
on this Master Wu?

549
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,680
You two have never even met!

550
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Master Wu's usual methods,

551
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,880
as you've heard,

552
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,930
he's not exactly a good person.

553
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,000
Yang Lin.

554
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,040
Do you remember

555
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,060
what this mansion used to be like?

556
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,130
In the mornings,

557
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,720
Father

558
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,080
would recite books with me in the corridor.

559
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,200
Mother would bring us soup she made herself.

560
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,360
At meals, the family would sit together

561
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
and chat about everyday things.

562
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I don't want to...

563
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,200
I really don't want to be alone

564
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,240
living in this empty house anymore.

565
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,850
No matter how many possessions I have,

566
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,680
they're still cold.

567
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,140
What does it matter if Master Wu isn't a good person?

568
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
As long as he's capable.

569
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,440
But sir,

570
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,240
this is Miss Xiaofei's golden statue!

571
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,020
When the heart is gone,

572
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,330
keeping these things is meaningless.

573
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,640
Consider it

574
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,120
my farewell to Xiaofei.

575
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,640
Take it out and melt it down.

576
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,840
Xu Ziqi.

577
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,960
Look.

578
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,680
That's a tree.

579
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,290
That's a flower.

580
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,920
Look at those clouds.

581
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,680
And that bird.

582
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,240
Xiaofei.

583
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,440
Even though I used to see them every day,

584
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,560
now that I've been given a second chance,

585
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,220
everything looks different.

586
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,940
The trees are so green.

587
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,010
The clouds are so white.

588
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,690
The flowers are so vibrant.

589
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,930
And the birds are so beautiful.

590
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,840
Xiaofei,

591
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,860
you're beautiful too.

592
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
When I think about

593
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,920
our nice house

594
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,440
burning down after less than 20 days,

595
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,730
it makes me so angry.

596
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,040
It's okay.

597
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
Manager Xing paid us good compensation.

598
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,280
As long as we still have the land,

599
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,960
rebuilding will be fine.

600
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,400
We can even improve the layout.

601
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Right.

602
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,290
The previous layout

603
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,200
had a living room that was too big and bedrooms too small.

604
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,600
The kitchen was too small too.

605
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,660
It affects your...

606
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,120
Wait,

607
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,330
isn't this our previous house?

608
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,800
How is it still here after the fire?

609
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,250
Let's go.

610
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,680
Mr. Xu.

611
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,600
Mr. Xu.

612
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,720
Mr. Xu.

613
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,600
Mr. Xu.

614
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,440
Mr. Xu loves his country and its people.

615
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,600
How could we let such a good official

616
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,800
not even have a place to live?

617
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,200
Today.

618
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,680
Indeed.

619
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,600
We found the original blueprints of the house.

620
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,840
Working day and night,

621
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,970
everyone pitched in

622
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
to rebuild this house for you.

623
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,000
It's identical inside and out,

624
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
down to the smallest detail.

625
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,760
Yes. Madam, would you like

626
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,440
to take a look inside?

627
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,720
Let's go.

628
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,120
Not too bad.

629
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,500
It's exactly the same.

630
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,360
Thank you all for your help, neighbors.

631
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,719
After we get settled,

632
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,600
I'll personally visit each of you to express my gratitude.

633
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,960
Then we'll be expecting Mr. Xu and Mrs. Xu

634
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,880
to come over for a drink.

635
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,239
We won't disturb you two any longer.

636
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,100
We're leaving.

637
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,489
Let's go.

638
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,489
Let's go.

639
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,719
Mrs. Xu?

640
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
We're not married yet.

641
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,320
Stay calm.

642
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,400
Not married?

643
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,900
What did you have in mind then?

644
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,300
What are you doing?

645
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,080
Xiaofei,

646
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,320
what's wrong?

647
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
I'm thinking about what to do next.

648
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,570
Now that things have settled down,

649
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,960
I plan to focus on my career again.

650
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
I want to get rich.

651
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
It might be difficult

652
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,500
with just my little treasure.

653
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,500
But I can't give up.

654
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,560
So,

655
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,960
I'll try my best

656
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,820
to remain a female tycoon.

657
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,880
What about you? What are your plans?

658
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,930
First, we need to set up our home properly.

659
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,920
I'm thinking of getting a bigger bed.

660
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,920
That way when we sleep together,

661
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,120
we won't easily roll off.

662
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,240
Then,

663
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
we need a large dining table,

664
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,290
an extremely large one.

665
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,100
And most importantly,

666
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
although my identity as an imperial detective

667
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,360
has been exposed,

668
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,080
I still need to continue investigating the chamber of commerce matter.

669
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,340
While the four elders are under control,

670
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,480
I plan to interrogate them thoroughly

671
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,000
to find out where the account book is hidden.

672
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,280
It's just one account book,

673
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,000
how can it be so impossible to find?

674
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,400
Maybe it's not an ordinary account book.

675
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
That makes sense.

676
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,490
For example?

677
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
Well,

678
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,160
it could be

679
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,800
an emotionless learning machine,

680
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,260
memorizing the accounts.

681
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,090
Actually just a living person.

682
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,520
That seems quite far-fetched.

683
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Or

684
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,480
maybe it's hidden in a secret cellar

685
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
guarded by monsters,

686
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,440
perhaps a three-headed dog

687
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,840
or a giant spider.

688
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,040
Or maybe there's a snake

689
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,220
that turns you to stone with one look.

690
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,040
Xiaofei,

691
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
you should focus on making money.

692
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,280
Leave the investigation to me.

693
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,960
Alright!

694
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,000
Sir, the person has arrived.

695
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,420
Why don't you remove the blindfold covering your eyes?

696
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,320
What you wish for me to see,

697
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,520
I will surely see.

698
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,760
What you don't wish for me to see,

699
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,160
I wouldn't dare look at all.

700
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,440
Take it off.

701
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,440
The items you presented,

702
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,180
I've seen them,

703
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,480
I like them very much,

704
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
and I accept them.

705
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
If you

706
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
have any requests of me,

707
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,280
feel free to speak.

708
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,280
I beg you to grant me real authority in the guild,

709
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,120
to give me a chance

710
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,000
to make something of myself.

711
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,880
Living without seeking comfort and peace,

712
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,620
insisting on making achievements instead.

713
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,960
You young people,

714
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,400
do you truly understand what it means that 'the wise adapt to circumstances'?

715
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,760
Being born in prosperous times -

716
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,120
these are the circumstances.

717
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,360
Not fighting, not grabbing,

718
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,960
not competing,

719
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,160
knowing your place - that's being wise.

720
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
What achievements do you seek?

721
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
To cause trouble for the court?

722
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,640
If you want achievements,

723
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,640
comfort and peace are certainly not what you seek.

724
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,480
Speak. What do you really want?

725
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,890
I am the son of the disgraced official Fang Siyou.

726
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,360
I want to find a patron

727
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,440
to clear me of the stigma of being a criminal's son.

728
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,960
You young people

729
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,960
still don't see through the ways of this world.

730
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,920
A stain is something that can never be truly cleaned.

731
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,520
When the stain is gone,

732
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,980
the fabric is also ruined.

733
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,760
It ruins both the appearance

734
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,920
and the substance.

735
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,080
Sir, I have nowhere else to turn.

736
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,440
Sir.

737
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
You are this humble one's last hope.

738
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,000
You're

739
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,560
quite obedient indeed.

740
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,360
You've given me such a nice gift,

741
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,060
I should return the favor.

742
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,000
Come on, bring it in.

743
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,960
Boss.

744
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,880
Didn't we agree to conduct an interrogation?

745
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
What's all this?

746
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,610
It looks like an ambush.

747
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,240
We're doing serious work here.

748
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,400
We finally caught these four elders.

749
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Of course we need to interrogate them

750
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,560
thoroughly and completely.

751
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,120
So...

752
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
We brought our own supplies.

753
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,440
Boss, boss.

754
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,730
Something terrible has happened!

755
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,640
Open it!

756
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,360
Sir,

757
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
I've been disrespectful.

758
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,560
Please punish me,

759
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,320
sir.

760
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
These elders of the guild

761
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,240
have little loyalty,

762
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,960
yet plenty of schemes.

763
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,760
They're so disobedient

764
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,970
and reckless in their actions.

765
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,810
Keeping them around will only cause trouble.

766
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,140
Take them away.

767
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,480
I've had someone remove those items.

768
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,840
You can open your eyes now.

769
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,760
Sir, may I ask where Elder Yi is now?

770
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,640
Elder Yi has confessed to the corruption charges

771
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,050
and will be executed tomorrow at noon.

772
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,520
Elder Yi has been good to you,

773
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,880
I am aware of that.

774
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Go see her one last time.

775
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Reminisce and share your thoughts,

776
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,120
and also resolve some

777
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,800
unfinished matters.

778
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,690
Unfinished matters...

779
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,760
It's getting late today.

780
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
You should head home now.

781
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,780
I understand, sir.

782
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,450
I will take my leave now.

783
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,320
I'll go now.

784
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,000
You may go.

785
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,160
Sir, do you think

786
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,520
that Fang Lihen is someone we can use?

787
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,240
He seems naive and easy to control.

788
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,880
But people,

789
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,170
who doesn't have their own agenda?

790
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,720
Go and watch carefully

791
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,000
what he said

792
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
to Yi Rusu in the prison.

793
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,040
This Yi Rusu,

794
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,520
is she hiding something from me?

795
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,000
Yes.

796
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,640
Go see her one last time.

797
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,120
She's dying.

798
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,440
Do you still want to keep secrets in this world?

799
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,360
Elder Yi.

800
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,800
These are all prepared for you by Xiaofei.

801
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,920
She said in this prison,

802
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,600
toiletries are in short supply.

803
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,000
Since you're

804
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,420
always so meticulous,

805
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,850
she prepared these things for you.

806
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,320
They're not expensive items though.

807
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,690
Please bear with it.

808
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,280
Last night,

809
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,660
the three of them never returned.

810
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,160
I knew

811
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,160
they wouldn't come back.

812
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,440
Elder Yi.

813
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,700
There's something important

814
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,160
I must ask you.

815
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,920
Is there a book in the guild that...

816
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,170
Why are you here?

817
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,650
I've come to visit Elder Yi.

818
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,420
Is that necessary?

819
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,600
Master Xu, could you give us some privacy?

820
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,440
I have something

821
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,960
to say to Fang Lihen.

822
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,000
Elder Yi.

823
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,280
I know you want to replace me

824
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,040
and that's why you framed me.

825
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,890
But I never thought Mr. Wu would be so ruthless

826
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,560
that he would take all four of our lives.

827
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,560
Is there any way to get you out of here?

828
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,080
It's too late. I have no choice.

829
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,290
I'm going to die anyway.

830
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,120
Elder Yi.

831
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:46,880
I...

832
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,760
You don't need to apologize to me.

833
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,880
Fang Lihen.

834
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,980
You've been oppressed by the guild for so many years

835
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,760
and suffered so much.

836
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,450
The guild is indeed falling apart now.

837
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,040
You made a choice to protect yourself.

838
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,600
There's nothing wrong with that.

839
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,480
Besides,

840
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,800
what the four of us did was truly heinous.

841
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,640
Since joining the guild,

842
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,120
I've always known I might die a gruesome death.

843
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,780
I've thought about it before.

844
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,610
What's with all this

845
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,440
commotion?

846
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,520
Noon approaches.

847
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,120
The prisoner Yi Rusu will be escorted to the execution ground.

848
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,960
Today...

849
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Mr. Wu.

850
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,240
He must have someone watching your every move,

851
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,320
to see if

852
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,760
you can still help him gather some information.

853
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,160
Shouldn't they at least give the person time to clean up?

854
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,220
It'll only take about half an incense stick. Just wait.

855
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,640
The chamber of commerce has a ledger.

856
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,840
I've hidden it inside the courtesan's portrait.

857
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,440
Find the courtesan's portrait.

858
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,760
This item must never be given to Master Wu.

859
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,360
This man is heartless

860
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,520
and completely untrustworthy.

861
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,440
You must find the ledger and keep it to protect yourself.

862
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,200
Do you understand?
