1
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,860
Have a seat.

2
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,520
It's such a thick book.

3
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,440
This will take all night to copy.

4
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
You've been copying for hours.

5
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,360
When will you finish?

6
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,480
Read ten thousand books.

7
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,100
Brew tea like a master.

8
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,920
Mr. Xu.

9
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Must you finish all of this tonight?

10
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,240
I must finish it all tonight.

11
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,080
Let's go.

12
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Um, Xu Ziqi.

13
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
Can we just

14
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040
go through the basics today?

15
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,040
You've almost finished the book.

16
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
Just review it at home.

17
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,050
First, learn how to judge water temperature.

18
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
Different types of tea

19
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,640
require different water temperatures for brewing.

20
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,079
Water has three boiling stages.

21
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,920
Today,

22
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,760
we'll learn

23
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,420
how to determine water temperature by bubbles.

24
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
The first boil

25
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,960
is when bubbles the size of crab eyes form at the bottom.

26
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,820
The second boil

27
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,120
is when bubbles the size of fish eyes appear around the edges.

28
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
The third boil

29
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,320
is when the water roils vigorously.

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm starting to boil the water now.

31
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,930
You need to watch it.

32
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
When it reaches the third boil,

33
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
let me know.

34
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,760
If your timing is perfect,

35
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,959
you'll pass the test.

36
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,320
Here.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
First boil.

38
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,680
Second boil.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
Xu Ziqi.

40
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
Xu Ziqi.

41
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,520
Xu Ziqi.

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
What are you thinking about?

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
I called you but you didn't hear me.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,530
Has the water reached the third boil already?

45
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes, it has.

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,880
So have I passed the first test?

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,200
You passed.

48
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,880
Next,

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,930
we'll learn how to make tea powder.

50
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Sounds good.

51
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,120
These are the tea powders I made.

52
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
If you can grind tea

53
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
half as fine as mine,

54
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
you'll pass the test.

55
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,560
What are you doing?

56
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,920
You have something on your mind.

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
You seem a bit off today.

58
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,480
Is something bothering you?

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,810
Tell me about it.

60
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,450
Give me a good laugh.

61
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,440
What's wrong with you?

62
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,120
So my troubles can entertain you?

63
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,320
See?

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,690
You do have something on your mind.

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,200
Can you please focus on your studies?

66
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,250
Look at this tea.

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
You've been grinding it forever.

68
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
And it's still inconsistent.

69
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,290
Can you be more serious?

70
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,640
What should I do then?

71
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,280
Why don't you show me how?

72
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Steady hands, calm mind.

73
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,320
Be serious.

74
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
What are you doing?

75
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm trying to feel

76
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,640
how to apply force smoothly and steadily.

77
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,440
Are you done feeling?

78
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,340
If you're done, let go.

79
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Don't disturb me.

80
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
Alright, that's enough.

81
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's move on to the next one.

82
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,800
O-okay.

83
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,140
When I say you've passed, you've passed.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,260
Master, please try it.

85
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,320
Xu Ziqi, you're really acting strange today.

86
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,640
The appearance and taste are both good.

87
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Really?

88
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,010
Then I'll have a sip too.

89
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
I knew you were acting weird today.

90
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,559
What's wrong with me?

91
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,159
You just

92
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,600
don't want to teach me properly.

93
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,780
You're hiding something.

94
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,680
I-

95
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,880
What could I possibly be hiding?

96
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,200
It's just that you can't learn no matter how I teach you.

97
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,680
What do you mean I can't learn?

98
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,280
Hey!

99
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Xu Ziqi, what's wrong?

100
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,600
Hey!

101
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
Xu Ziqi, open the door!

102
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

103
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,080
You're not hiding anything.

104
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,800
It's me, I'm being silly.

105
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Xu Ziqi,

106
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
just pretend nothing happened

107
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,170
and forgive me, please?

108
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,200
Xu Ziqi?

109
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
You didn't do anything wrong.

110
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,980
It's just that I...

111
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
We can't brew tea together anymore.

112
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,320
Why not?

113
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,440
Weren't we just fine a moment ago?

114
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
Don't say anything more.

115
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
Some things

116
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,480
just won't work no matter how hard you try.

117
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,740
I just tasted your tea.

118
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,600
Compared to Gu Jin'er's tea,

119
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,940
yours is far inferior.

120
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,400
Really?

121
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
It couldn't be more true.

122
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,100
Just accept that you have no affinity for tea ceremony.

123
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,620
Let's just give up.

124
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Hua Xiaofei.

125
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,040
Xiaofei?

126
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,800
Xiaofei?

127
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,130
I've gone crazy.

128
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
What am I even saying?

129
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,840
Xiaofei.

130
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Xiaofei.

131
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,080
Xiaofei.

132
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,680
Xiaofei.

133
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Xiaofei.

134
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,680
Xiaofei.

135
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,080
Ziqi.

136
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,560
Ali.

137
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,130
What are you doing out here?

138
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,600
Well,

139
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm just taking a walk around.

140
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,360
Where's Hua Xiaofei?

141
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
She just left.

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Did she learn the tea ceremony that quickly?

143
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,200
Not really,

144
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
but she learns quite fast.

145
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,940
She's quite talented.

146
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,040
So does she

147
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
have any chance of winning the competition?

148
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
Are you

149
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,440
hoping she'll win or lose?

150
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,320
Lose.

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,320
Is that what the chamber wants?

152
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,720
Yes.

153
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,840
Ali,

154
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
the chamber is corrupt.

155
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
You should find a way to get out soon.

156
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
You know I can't.

157
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,680
Ziqi, this is my only way to bring my parents

158
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,160
back home.

159
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,800
So much for being Tang Dynasty's

160
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,530
top tea master. All show and no substance.

161
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,250
Something's not right.

162
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Although I never studied it before,

163
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,040
I mastered water observation,

164
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
tea whipping and grinding right away.

165
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,450
How can I not learn this now?

166
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,890
Why can't I compete with Gu Jin'er?

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,680
No.

168
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,280
I need to go back and pester Xu Ziqi to teach me.

169
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
Hello, customer.

170
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,800
This is today's free gift.

171
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Lychee cherry mare's milk glutinous rice wine

172
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,130
and pearl glutinous rice ball sweet soup.

173
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Wait a second.

174
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,040
Tell me,

175
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,680
what is this?

176
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,680
Lychee cherry,

177
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,140
mare's milk glutinous rice wine,

178
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,650
and pearl glutinous rice ball sweet soup.

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,200
Thank you.

180
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,370
Enjoy your meal.

181
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
Mare's milk...

182
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,480
Pearls...

183
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Mare's milk...

184
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,680
Bubble tea!

185
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,200
Bubble tea!

186
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,080
Isn't that tea too?

187
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
You're awake.

188
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,800
Why am I at your place?

189
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,560
You got drunk last night.

190
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,080
So I brought you back.

191
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,160
Xu Ziqi, why are you here?

192
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,960
I don't want to talk to you.

193
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,320
Are you here to spy on my secrets?

194
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,600
I was drunk.

195
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,440
You brought me home.

196
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,320
Where else could I take you?

197
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,440
That makes sense.

198
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,720
What's this?

199
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,440
You forgot?

200
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
This is your signature move.

201
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
Last night,

202
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,280
I used all my strength

203
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,560
but couldn't pry it from your hands.

204
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Your secret weapon to victory.

205
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,400
Treasure.

206
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,200
The greatest tea master of Tang Dynasty.

207
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll brew you a very special tea.

208
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,900
Just do as I say.

209
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,280
It'll definitely work out.

210
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,920
Boss Xu!

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,720
Boss!

212
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,960
Coming!

213
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,560
Boss!

214
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,680
We've searched the entire Chang'an City

215
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,600
for this horse milk,

216
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,130
sheep milk, and camel milk.

217
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,200
The task you gave us,

218
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
we've accomplished it.

219
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,680
So,

220
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,360
we'll take our leave now.

221
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Stop right there.

222
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
What's the rush?

223
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,720
I still have something for you.

224
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,480
Come in.

225
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
Boss,

226
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,200
how about this?

227
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,040
Just let us off the hook today.

228
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,680
Miss Xiaofei's concoctions...

229
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,840
we really don't deserve such treatment.

230
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720
You seem quite bothered about having tea with me.

231
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,440
No, no.

232
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,500
Come in.

233
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,210
I've never seen anyone cook like this.

234
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,400
Sit down.

235
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Take a seat.

236
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,480
Sit.

237
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,560
Have a seat.

238
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,720
Sit.

239
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Try the food in the white bowl first.

240
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,440
Hey!

242
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,980
This...

243
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,240
It's too gamey.

244
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,240
Looks like camel and goat milk won't work.

245
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,560
We'll have to use cow's milk.

246
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,440
Cow's milk? Isn't that water buffalo milk?

247
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Water buffalo milk isn't gamey,

248
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,120
but it's not creamy enough.

249
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,920
We need to use dairy cows.

250
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
Dairy cows?

251
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,360
You don't have dairy cows here?

252
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,730
Never heard of them.

253
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,840
Dairy cows are like yellow cattle

254
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,820
but they don't have horns.

255
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,680
I mean the horns on their heads,

256
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,240
not that they don't have feet.

257
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,440
They're black and white,

258
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,640
with patches of both colors.

259
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,540
Let me do it myself.

260
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,720
This...

261
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,200
This is a dairy cow.

262
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,000
Well,

263
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,520
use your drawing for the outline

264
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,920
and mine for the pattern.

265
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,120
Yes,

266
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,400
that's it.

267
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,810
I've never seen a cow like this before.

268
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,720
Does the Tang Dynasty really not have these animals?

269
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,760
In all my life,

270
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
I've never seen

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,330
or heard of such a thing.

272
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,640
It seems

273
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,960
we'll have to use the last option.

274
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,220
What are you doing?

275
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,000
Hua Xiaofei, calm down!

276
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you doing?

277
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Xu Ziqi.

278
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,960
Please teach me the art of tea ceremony.

279
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
I'll go find a cow right now.

280
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
I'll go immediately.

281
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,600
Have you two ever seen this species?

282
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,520
No.

283
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,040
Really haven't.

284
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,960
Truly never seen it.

285
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
I don't know what it is.

286
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
What is this, sir?

287
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,140
Master Xu, please take a look.

288
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,120
Is it this?

289
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,200
What on earth is this?

290
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,210
I heard these small animals

291
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,280
love to run wild on slopes like this.

292
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,330
If we just wait here,

293
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,960
one will surely run right into us.

294
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,780
Waiting for prey to come to us.

295
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,280
Boss Xu! Boss Xu!

296
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,560
You need to check on Miss Fei.

297
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
She's messing with the horses.

298
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,780
The men can't stop her.

299
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,360
What?

300
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
Miss Fei was trying to milk the horses.

301
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,960
She was chasing them around the stable.

302
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,290
And then... then she got kicked by a horse.

303
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,170
Let's go.

304
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,480
Come on, hurry!

305
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,040
It's so hard.

306
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,300
Sir, the horse is fine.

307
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,680
Xiaofei.

308
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Are you okay?

309
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,120
This...

310
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,600
This...

311
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,120
Just this little bit.

312
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,770
I don't know if it's enough.

313
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,240
What...

314
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,040
What's wrong? Is it not enough?

315
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,760
If it's not enough, I can go get more.

316
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,720
Don't cry.

317
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
No need.

318
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
Thank you, Xu Ziqi.

319
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,280
I just wanted to win too badly.

320
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,880
Look what I've done to you.

321
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm fine.

322
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,250
Please stop crying.

323
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Don't cry.

324
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,760
It's okay.

325
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,520
Sir.

326
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,640
Mr. Xu, are you looking for cows?

327
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,200
Miss Yang, do you know where I can find cows?

328
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
Although the Tang Dynasty doesn't have cows,

329
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
I

330
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,160
have heard about these animals from Western merchants.

331
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,880
Would you be so kind as to share

332
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,720
where I might find such animals?

333
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,760
I can. But I have one condition.

334
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,450
What condition?

335
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,180
This is a red string from the Matchmaker Temple.

336
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,120
I have confirmed my feelings for you,

337
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,220
and hope you will accept this gift

338
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,040
and wear this string of fate.

339
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,880
Miss Yang,

340
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,120
such matters

341
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,180
aren't appropriate to express so directly.

342
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,200
Why not?

343
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,280
Well,

344
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,360
these

345
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,720
intimate matters should be decided by parents,

346
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,440
and shouldn't be...

347
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,200
Sir,

348
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,680
I only know books,

349
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,520
but I've learned much from them.

350
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,880
In this life,

351
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
one should act with honesty and integrity,

352
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,220
not be hindered by worldly conventions.

353
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Once the heart is moved,

354
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,100
one should express it openly.

355
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,170
I consider myself accomplished in both literary and martial arts.

356
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,200
Sir.

357
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,720
Miss Yang, I cannot accept your red string.

358
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
Please go home, Miss Yang.

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,040
Fine.

360
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,960
I will go back for now.

361
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll return when you've sorted out your thoughts.

362
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,840
The cow is on West Mountain.

363
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,860
I take my leave.

364
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,440
Miss Yang.

365
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,720
Even though you've told me where the cow is,

366
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,240
I still cannot agree to your terms.

367
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,500
There was never any need for conditions.

368
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,440
I was merely testing you.

369
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,720
If you had agreed so easily,

370
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,090
that would have been too calculating.

371
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Now I've confirmed that

372
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,440
you are exactly the kind of person

373
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
with true feelings and character that I want.

374
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,960
I'll go back and wait until you've sorted your thoughts.

375
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,620
Then you will understand that

376
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,240
Debiao is your perfect match.

377
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,300
I take my leave.

378
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
West Mountain.

379
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,580
One hour later,

380
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,240
the second round of the competition begins.

381
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,040
What's wrong with Hua Xiaofei?

382
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,520
She seems to have no fighting spirit.

383
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
She'll definitely lose this round.

384
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,360
Xu Ziqi.

385
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
Cow.

386
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,120
Um,

387
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,680
I heard there were Hu people raising these in the western mountains,

388
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,040
so I just went to take a look.

389
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,960
Surprisingly, they really had some.

390
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,890
That's amazing!

391
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,480
I love you so much, Xu Ziqi!

392
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,440
Hey,

393
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,160
the competition is about to start.

394
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,220
You should hurry so you won't be late.

395
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,820
Aren't you coming?

396
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,680
I have some urgent business to take care of now.

397
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,340
I'll come over after I'm done.

398
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,400
Alright, I'll wait for you.

399
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Well,

400
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
I'll leave this cow with you then.

401
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,970
Go ahead.

402
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Cow.

403
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
These Hu people's weapons are really formidable.

404
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,360
Hua Xiaofei's hand is way too heavy.

405
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,680
In this Flower Queen competition,

406
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,480
there's a woman named Hua Xiaofei who has some skills.

407
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,240
Your Majesty wants to help her become the Flower Queen

408
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,960
to use her as a pawn to infiltrate the merchant guild.

409
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,760
Your Majesty,

410
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I believe

411
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,530
this is inappropriate.

412
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,760
Why is it inappropriate?

413
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,840
Hua Xiaofei has no relatives,

414
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,760
making her difficult to control.

415
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
Second, her personality is reckless,

416
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,960
hard to manage.

417
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,760
Therefore, I believe she is not a good candidate.

418
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,600
I have also heard

419
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,400
about the various incidents this woman has caused in Chang'an.

420
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,200
Indeed,

421
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,640
she's not an obedient woman.

422
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,440
She doesn't listen at all

423
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,360
and is extremely difficult to control.

424
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,640
I will have someone discipline her.

425
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,160
The eunuchs in the palace are very experienced.

426
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,160
There's no one they cannot train properly.

427
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
Smooth sailing.

428
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,600
Great fortune and prosperity.

429
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,680
Good.

430
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,920
What is that?

431
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,920
Sir,

432
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,040
what's this troublemaker doing here?

433
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,770
I don't know.

434
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,600
Is that Xu the foreman

435
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,800
who brought it back from West Mountain?

436
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Brother, what is the former sister-in-law leading?

437
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Yes,

438
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,160
it looks

439
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,160
like a bull.

440
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,760
Ladies and gentlemen,

441
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,200
the

442
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,440
second round of the Oiran Competition,

443
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,480
the tea ceremony contest will begin shortly.

444
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,280
First,

445
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,920
let me introduce the contestants.

446
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,960
Last year's Oiran champion, Miss Gu Jin'er.

447
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,600
[Applause]

448
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,440
And her assistant, Miss Huan'er.

449
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,600
This year's dark horse,

450
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,920
Miss Hua Xiaofei.

451
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
And her assistant

452
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,760
Cow.

453
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,570
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce the competition rules.

454
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,680
This tea ceremony competition

455
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,880
will focus on tea brewing skills.

456
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,240
No specific tea variety is required.

457
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
No specific water source is required.

458
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,680
No specific utensils are required.

459
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,240
Everything is up to the two contestants.

460
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,960
Finally,

461
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,440
the taste and spiritual essence of the brewed tea

462
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
will be the basis for voting.

463
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,440
The contestant with more votes

464
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,240
will be the winner of the second round.

465
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,240
Ladies,

466
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,600
please prepare.

467
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,810
Brother.

468
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,880
What

469
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,900
does the former sister-in-law mean by this?

470
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Our Koi Alliance

471
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,960
is blessed by the koi

472
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,220
requires daily fish-touching rituals.

473
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,240
Look at Xiaofei's cow

474
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,960
with its majestic presence,

475
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,040
unique patterns,

476
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,240
smooth horns,

477
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,760
it's no ordinary creature.

478
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,520
I bet it must be her

479
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
guardian beast.

480
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,000
Guardian beast.

481
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
Brother, you're brilliant.

482
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,360
Of course.

483
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,100
Let's get to business.

484
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,680
Everyone raise your signs up

485
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,120
and cheer for Gu Jin'er with me.

486
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,640
Go Gu Jin'er!

487
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,520
Gu Jin'er will win!

488
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,600
Go Gu Jin'er!

489
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
Gu Jin'er will win!

490
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,640
Go Hua Xiaofei!

491
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,440
Go Gu Jin'er!

492
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,840
Go Hua Xiaofei!

493
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,840
Come on! Go Hua Xiaofei!

494
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,400
Go Hua Xiaofei!

495
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
Go Hua Xiaofei!

496
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,360
Go Hua Xiaofei!

497
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
Go Gu Jin'er!

498
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,840
Erha,

499
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,800
did you prepare everything I asked for?

500
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,520
Sir, look.

501
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,840
All set. Absolutely valuable.

502
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,160
Sir,

503
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,760
is this a congratulatory gift for Miss Jin'er's victory?

504
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,000
This is for

505
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,440
comforting Hua Xiaofei after her defeat.

506
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
For Hua Xiaofei?

507
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,880
Alright.

508
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,440
Ladies and gentlemen, I declare the competition officially open.

509
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,000
Great!

510
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,520
Excellent!

511
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,720
Good!

512
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,880
Well done!

513
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,960
Nice!

514
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,600
Brother.

515
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,340
Sister-in-law's movements are so elegant.

516
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,560
Beautiful!

517
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,620
What on earth is the former sister-in-law up to?

518
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,040
I have no idea.

519
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,640
Sir, look at Miss Jin'er's movements.

520
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
She's truly as beautiful as a heavenly fairy.

521
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,100
Much better than that troublemaker.

522
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,530
Wait for my command.

523
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,490
Yes, sir.

524
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,560
The art of tea ceremony emphasizes tranquility and stillness.

525
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,520
Miss Hua Xiaofei's behavior

526
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,280
is truly inappropriate.

527
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,800
What is this thing?

528
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,460
I've never seen it before.

529
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,800
Time's up.

530
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,960
Would both contestants please present their tea.

531
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,960
This tea is called 'Transcending to Immortality.'

532
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,040
I have chosen the finest Xiangyu tea.

533
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
As its name suggests,

534
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,460
it has a lingering fragrance.

535
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
I brewed it quickly with boiling water

536
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,400
to preserve its richest aroma.

537
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,840
The tea is light yet has a profound aftertaste.

538
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,240
It makes one feel

539
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,480
ethereal yet grounded.

540
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,640
Throughout the tea preparation,

541
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,440
my movements mimicked the divine dance from Chu poetry.

542
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,500
Striving for elegance and softness,

543
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,440
that's why this tea is called

544
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,580
'Transcending to Immortality.'

545
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,400
Good.

546
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,920
The aroma is rich,

547
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,260
and this tea has remarkable complexity.

548
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,120
It truly lives up to its name 'Transcending to Immortality.'

549
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,880
Miss Jin, your tea skills are truly exceptional.

550
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,500
This tea is called 'Birth of All Things.'

551
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,080
'Birth of All Things.' Quite an ambitious name.

552
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,320
With tea in hand,

553
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,900
the world is in your heart.

554
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,280
I was wondering

555
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,920
if it's possible to put everything in one cup of tea.

556
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,840
This tea contains milk,

557
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,120
rice, sugar,

558
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,380
salt, the sweet and sour taste of lychee,

559
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,120
and even the essence of the firewood used to boil the water.

560
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,320
All the essentials of daily life - fuel, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea -

561
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,080
I've tried to blend them all into this bowl.

562
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,860
Everyone, please use this small straw to drink the tea.

563
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,560
You'll suck up these small black pellets.

564
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,450
Don't they look like black pearls?

565
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,160
I believe life is about finding pearls

566
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,640
in the ordinary moments.

567
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,120
That's why this tea is called 'Birth of All Things.'

568
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,360
Good.

569
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,840
Excellent.

570
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,920
Mr. Liu Bo,

571
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,200
you're a master in the tea world.

572
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,440
What do you think of this tea?

573
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,960
Miss Hua, this cup of Wanwu Sheng

574
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,360
truly has a distinctive flavor,

575
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,820
with a smooth texture,

576
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,040
the sweet freshness of tea

577
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,400
and the richness of milk fragrance.

578
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,760
Especially those tapioca pearls.

579
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,890
The texture of those little pearls

580
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
is simply amazing.

581
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,040
Indeed.

582
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,440
It's truly something that cannot be described

583
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,520
in words.

584
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,120
Do you feel especially happy while drinking it?

585
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,080
Very, very happy.

586
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,040
Yes.

587
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,760
That's exactly why I developed this tea.

588
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,960
Everything has life.

589
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
Life is joyful.

590
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,360
Drinking tea is about experiencing this joy.

591
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,490
Brother,

592
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,700
it tastes amazing.

593
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,920
It's really delicious.

594
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,040
How can there be

595
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,280
such wonderful tea in this world?

596
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,440
My life is complete now.

597
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,320
You're being too dramatic.

598
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
We are already happy.

599
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,280
Indeed happy.

600
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,520
Sir,

601
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,720
these judges seem genuinely happy.

602
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,600
If this continues,

603
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,240
we'll be the unhappy ones.

604
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,280
Let's wait and see.

605
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,440
Please welcome Mr. Yang to announce the results.

606
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,320
Miss Gu Jin'er's tea ceremony shows exquisite traditional skills

607
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,400
with remarkable techniques.

608
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,120
Miss Xiaofei's tea ceremony demonstrates innovation

609
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,720
with unique craftsmanship.

610
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,840
For this round,

611
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,600
we judges unanimously agree that both performances are equally matched

612
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,040
and equally excellent. We declare it

613
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,960
a tie.

614
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
What? How can it be a tie?

615
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,160
Everyone,

616
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,360
the judges have declared a tie.

617
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,050
So the outcome of this second round

618
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,700
will be decided by all of you in the audience.

619
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,800
We will now beat the drum ten times,

620
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,400
and when the drumming stops, voting ends.

621
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,480
Please cast your votes.

622
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,440
When the drum sounds,

623
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,560
voting begins.

624
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,090
Brother,

625
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,530
go vote for Jin'er and Xiaofei,

626
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,100
20,000 votes each.

627
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,800
Yes.

628
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,850
Let's go.

629
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,440
[Two drum beats]

630
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,080
What's

631
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,760
going on here?

632
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,800
Sir.

633
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,090
Could Master Yang be

634
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,740
having a reaction to the milk tea?

635
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,640
Did it give Master Yang

636
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,280
an upset stomach?

637
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,360
I think so, brother.

638
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,960
I drank a bowl of it too.

639
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,440
[Three drum beats]

640
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,440
[Four drum beats]

641
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,160
Erha.

642
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Let them begin.

643
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,120
Remember, at all costs,

644
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,480
push up Gu Jin'er's votes.

645
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes.

646
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,640
[Five drum beats]

647
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,160
[Six drum beats]

648
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,120
[Seven drum beats]

649
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,440
The money for the courtesan election tickets

650
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,480
I will have someone

651
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
deliver it to you before the voting.

652
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,760
Remember,

653
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,120
I want Hua Xiaofei

654
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,160
Serve my purpose.

655
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,280
Eight drum beats.

656
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,320
Nine drum beats.

657
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,560
Ten drum beats.

658
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,890
Stop. Seal the ballots.

659
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

660
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,160
Gu Jin'er received

661
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,480
106,345 votes.

662
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,120
Hua Xiaofei received

663
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,960
83,274 votes.

664
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,460
I hereby announce.

665
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,800
The winner of the second round tea ceremony contest

666
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,920
in the courtesan competition: Gu Jin'er.

667
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
Great!

668
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,280
Follow my signal.

669
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,920
Cast all your votes for Gu Jin'er.

670
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,840
We absolutely cannot give Hua Xiaofei any chance to recover.

671
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,040
Before my ancestors,

672
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,260
I, Ziqi, am disobeying orders

673
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,890
out of absolute necessity.

674
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,380
If Hua Xiaofei wins the courtesan title,

675
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,480
she will be innocently drawn into court disputes,

676
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,940
lose her freedom forever,

677
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,770
and her life would be in danger.

678
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,560
I don't wish to harm the innocent,

679
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,820
which is why I disobey.

680
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,880
If I can protect Hua Xiaofei,

681
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,560
I will devote my life to serving the people.

682
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,320
I will expose the conspiracy behind all this.

683
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,440
Ladies.

684
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,520
The final round of the courtesan competition will focus on attire and makeup.

685
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,360
In ten days,

686
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,240
we will continue here.

687
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,040
Attire and makeup.

688
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,240
However, in three days,

689
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,400
you must confirm your registration at the registration site.

690
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,160
Ladies,

691
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,760
see you in three days.

692
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Let's go back now.

693
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,700
I'll prepare everything for you.

694
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,080
Master Zhang,

695
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,480
why are you in such a hurry?

696
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,040
Oh, it's Instructor Xue.

697
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,040
Instructor Xue, please accept this.

698
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,800
Are these

699
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
all for me?

700
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,480
Master Zhang,

701
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,080
I can see your sincerity toward our Jin'er.

702
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,720
These gifts are enough for you and your brothers

703
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
to stay here for a while.

704
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,760
However, there's one thing I must remind you of,

705
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,600
which is:

706
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,440
Do not disturb Miss Jin'er's life.

707
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,360
Rest assured, Instructor Xue.

708
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,960
I will lead my brothers

709
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,760
to quietly protect Miss Jin'er,

710
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,120
and ensure she experiences no discomfort whatsoever.

711
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,880
Perfect.

712
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,920
Brother.

713
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,480
Yes?

714
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,010
Guard this place carefully

715
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,280
and don't let any man in.

716
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:36,960
Yes, sir.

717
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,440
[Complete surveillance coverage]

718
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,370
Over there. And over there too.

719
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,800
Jin'er, don't worry.

720
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,560
When it comes to fashion,

721
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,520
Hua Xiaofei will definitely lose.

722
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
But she always

723
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,760
has some strange ideas.

724
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,360
I still can't let my guard down.

725
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,410
Alright.

726
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,640
Come on, I'll go out first.

727
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,610
Try on these two outfits again.

728
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,760
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
