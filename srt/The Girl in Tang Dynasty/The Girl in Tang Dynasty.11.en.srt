1
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,930
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

2
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,290
Why are you here?

3
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,360
Why are you here?

4
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,680
Yuanhan.

5
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,240
Didn't I tell you

6
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Don't let anyone in.

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,840
Brother.

8
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
You only let us see men.

9
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,079
but not women.

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Nothing

11
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,560
Take him away.

12
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,210
Let's go.

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,640
It's here. It's here.

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,079
I...

15
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,640
Shut up. I didn't ask you.

16
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm asking Zhang Gui Cai.

17
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,560
It's late.

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,640
What are you doing here

19
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,770
with your brothers?

20
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,320
Miss Jin'er.

21
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Here's the thing.

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,520
I've observed carefully before.

23
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,240
Many men admired Jin'er

24
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,800
many men admire Jin'er.

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,840
but there are some filthy people among them.

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,560
I think as a girl,

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,079
How can she be insulted

28
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,120
by these filthy people.

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,520
So I took my brothers

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,520
take turns to protect them.

31
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,960
If you find

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,960
dirty people,

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Take him down on the spot.

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
Mr. Zhang, you...

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
You have guts.

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
Your heart

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,720
It's good. It's good.

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
But

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,240
Come in while Jin'er is changing.

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,700
when Jin'er gets changed.

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
Hero, this is a misunderstanding.

42
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,560
Jin'er is the best girl in the world.

43
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,400
I love her and respect her.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,840
I dare not insult her.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
It's my responsibility to protect Jin'er all my life.

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,240
I can only observe from afar.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,300
Don't disturb him.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,520
I don't want

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,840
to trouble Jin'er.

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,560
Yes.

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,260
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Before going out,

53
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
before going out.

54
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,560
I came here after touching the fish.

55
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,440
Yes.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
We swear with our lives.

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,760
I never peeped at you.

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
If I lie to you,

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,260
Our boss will be struck by lightning.

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,560
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,680
I'll be struck by lightning.

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,760
We will be struck by lightning.

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,680
Yes, we will be struck by lightning.

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes, I swear.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,200
If I peeped at you on purpose,

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
I'll be struck by lightning.

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,700
You don't have to say that.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,000
I trust you.

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Thank you for your trust.

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I must do better in the future.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
I'll do better.

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,880
I...

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,440
I'll marry you.

74
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,080
Look.

75
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,000
I've been exercising recently.

76
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Isn't it good?

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,880
Look.

78
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,360
You

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
lost weight.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
It didn't work.

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,520
You...

82
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,570
What are you doing here?

83
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Isn't the final round a competition of clothes?

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
I...

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,200
I know my enemy.

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,530
Pick it up and report it to the government.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
Wait, Jin'er.

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,360
Just let her go

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,810
let her go this time.

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,000
Zheng, look.

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,760
If you want to see Jin'er,

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
you can take a look.

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
You're not a kid anymore. Why are you pulling the window?

94
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,640
Yes.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,560
She won't show it to me.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,000
Yuanhan.

97
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,730
Let's go.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Let's go.

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Jin'er, rest early.

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,080
No.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,760
Goodbye.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Let me go!

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Hero.

104
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
I think you've recovered.

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,250
Let's play together when you're free.

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,440
Let go of me!

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,800
Let go of me!

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,120
Brother.

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,440
What about the ex-sister-in-law?

110
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,960
Don't talk nonsense.

111
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,180
You only have one sister-in-law.

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,240
That's to listen to Jin'er's wife.

113
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,100
Get her to the government office.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,760
Let go!

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,330
Who's going to the government office?

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,760
Brother Xu.

117
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,360
Lord Xu.

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,000
Xu Ziqi.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Xu Ziqi!

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,770
They want to take me to the government.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Xu Ziqi, how about you pretend to arrest me

122
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,440
and let me go when no one is around.

123
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,000
Brother Xu, this is a good idea.

124
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,210
Oh my god.

125
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,320
Bro, it's okay.

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,080
But your voice is too loud.

127
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,360
Hua Xiaochi keeps disturbing the atmosphere.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,200
and disregarded the law.

129
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
and ruthless.

130
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,000
It's tolerable.

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,240
sentenced

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,960
expelled from Chang'an.

133
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,340
Execute immediately.

134
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,250
Your acting skills have improved.

135
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,800
Yes.

136
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,320
Arrest me.

137
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Keep patrolling.

138
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,320
Yes.

139
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
I knew you would come to save me.

140
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,620
Are you listening?

141
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,880
Where are we going?

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
Get out of Chang'an!

143
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Open the door!

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,920
Never step into Chang'an again.

145
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,340
Hua Xiao Zheng,

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,130
Whether it's Chang'an,

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
or the name of the Oiran,

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
you can't afford.

149
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Xu Ziqi, I didn't do anything wrong.

150
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Who are you to kick me out of Chang'an?

151
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,160
Who gave you the right?

152
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,680
Under the order of Chief Xu,

153
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,440
to escort Miss Xiao Zheng to a safe place.

154
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Ms. Zheng.

155
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,200
Get in.

156
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,040
Take him.

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,970
I'm not leaving.

158
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,080
I, Xu Ziqi,

159
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
to leave Chang'an.

160
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,920
And she has given up the election for the Oiran.

161
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,220
She will never step into Chang'an again.

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,960
I know

163
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,840
the corruption of the Chamber of Commerce is involved.

164
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,800
This negligence is unforgivable.

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,160
Your Majesty,

166
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,320
give me a chance to make amends.

167
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,200
I will serve the court for the rest of my life.

168
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,720
I will never mention retirement.

169
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,960
I just want to share your burden.

170
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,680
for the people.

171
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,960
for the people.

172
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,080
I will do my best to die.

173
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
I

174
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,680
by Xu Ziqi.

175
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,370
Miss Xiao Zheng.

176
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Please.

177
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,010
Miss Xiao Zheng.

178
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,600
This is the place our boss arranged for you.

179
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,680
Peace.

180
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
I thought

181
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,570
he helped me find the cow because he believed I could win.

182
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,960
Turns out he thought I would lose.

183
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,120
He wanted to throw me out of Chang'an long time ago.

184
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,760
I have to run back and teach him a lesson.

185
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,480
Ms. Zheng.

186
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,720
You are naughty.

187
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,440
I just want to see how you react.

188
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,720
Lord Tu.

189
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Let me introduce.

190
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,800
It's full of people.

191
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
We are

192
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,800
Let's go. Let's go.

193
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm so excited.

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,560
Please come in.

195
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,320
Please, Miss Xiao.

196
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,960
Please.

197
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,960
Why didn't I learn Guqin properly back then?

198
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,680
Now I feel sad.

199
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,720
I can't stop.

200
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,200
I can't write a song

201
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,480
to commemorate this scene.

202
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,560
Maybe with my

203
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
with my unbreakable feeling

204
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,560
Get me a music score.

205
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,800
It might be done soon.

206
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,080
Speak of the devil.

207
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,810
Here comes the music score.

208
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,440
Hua Xiaochi

209
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,280
You idiot!

210
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,400
I knew you'd run away.

211
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,890
It's deeper and deeper.

212
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,810
Deeper and heavier.

213
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,930
Sleep early.

214
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,440
Good night.

215
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,370
I'm going to bed.

216
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,040
If you don't let me out today,

217
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
I'll die in front of you.

218
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
What are you doing?

219
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,200
One knife is enough.

220
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,560
Ms. Zheng.

221
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,400
If you go out,

222
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,680
Chief Xu will kill us too.

223
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,260
How about this?

224
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,320
Let's go together.

225
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
In the afterlife,

226
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,080
in the afterlife.

227
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,720
What?

228
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
Miss Li,

229
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,320
The position of the knife is not right.

230
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
The aorta is here.

231
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Put it here.

232
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
if you put it here.

233
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,080
How about this?

234
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,010
I'll count down to five.

235
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,240
Let's do it together.

236
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,960
We don't wish to be born on the same day.

237
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,560
but to die on the same day.

238
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,440
Five, four, three, two.

239
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,040
Life is so beautiful.

240
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,600
Don't be impulsive.

241
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
Put it down.

242
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,080
You win.

243
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
Just like your boss, Xu Ziqi.

244
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,080
as your boss Xu Ziqi.

245
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,160
I'm not leaving.

246
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,450
I won't leave, okay?

247
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
Why are you kneeling?

248
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Men have gold to kneel down.

249
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,920
What about dignity and dignity?

250
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,680
I don't want it.

251
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
You guys are awesome!

252
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,560
There will be a way to escape.

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,460
Xu Ziqi has flying skills.

254
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,440
I have a stick.

255
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Three.

256
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,240
What are you doing?

257
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
What are you doing?

258
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
It's not stabilized.

259
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,280
Not stable.

260
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,040
What are you doing?

261
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
It's weird.

262
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,400
Yeah

263
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,680
Look.

264
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,400
Three.

265
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
No.

266
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,200
Well...

267
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,920
This stick doesn't work.

268
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,240
Come on!

269
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,160
Can we do it next time?

270
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,400
The third time will do.

271
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,440
You can do it.

272
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,240
Come on! Come on!

273
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
Come on! Come on!

274
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,320
Three.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,160
Three.

276
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,480
Stop looking.

277
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's go.

278
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,680
Ziqi.

279
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,640
I asked you here today

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,520
to ask you for a favor.

281
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,200
What is it?

282
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,250
I have confirmed with the four Elders.

283
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,250
Gu Jin'er won this time.

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
someone

285
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,440
behind my back.

286
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,720
I want to know who he is.

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,440
Is he an enemy?

288
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,960
Friends?

289
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Did the four elders ask you to ask me?

290
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,960
Yes.

291
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,200
The Chamber of Commerce is just an organization

292
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,860
to promote public relations.

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,640
Why are they so nosy?

294
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,360
Who is behind Gu Jin'er?

295
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,890
has nothing to do with them.

296
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,040
You

297
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,680
don't always listen to

298
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,740
to the four of them.

299
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
Be careful

300
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,880
in the mess of the Chamber of Commerce.

301
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,920
I know it too.

302
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,200
But now,

303
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Aye's mother

304
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
is still exiled at the border.

305
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
I've been hoping to use the Chamber of Commerce

306
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,360
with the Chamber of Commerce

307
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,020
and get them back soon.

308
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,480
Li,

309
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,720
Even if you want to sacrifice yourself,

310
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,280
I want you to know what you should do.

311
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,860
and what you shouldn't do.

312
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,520
and not ascend.

313
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,040
But don't sink.

314
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Ziqi.

315
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
If one day

316
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
my mother can return to Chang'an,

317
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,600
At that time,

318
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,840
I had no choice.

319
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,340
Please take good care of them.

320
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,490
What are you talking about?

321
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,940
Take care of yourself.

322
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,050
Alright.

323
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm hanging up.

324
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm leaving. I have to be on guard tonight.

325
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,000
I have to go check.

326
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,640
Goodbye.

327
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,920
Miss Xiao.

328
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,760
Leave me alone.

329
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,720
Miss Zheng.

330
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,960
I'm fine.

331
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,960
You misunderstood.

332
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,680
The wind

333
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,880
a few days ago.

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,760
I

335
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
borrow this bamboo stick

336
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,680
to fix it.

337
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,360
Thank you.

338
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,920
Remember to give it back to me.

339
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,720
I still need it.

340
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,680
Don't worry.

341
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
I'll return it to you.

342
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,280
No.

343
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,040
I have to follow him.

344
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,000
Let me see.

345
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,920
Hurry up.

346
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,880
Here.

347
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,720
Here.

348
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,680
Here.

349
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,200
Give it to me.

350
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Hurry up.

351
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,280
Give it to me

352
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Sister

353
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,440
Do you know how to tie this?

354
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,860
Let me do it.

355
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,480
Thank you.

356
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,410
You're welcome.

357
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
Ms. Li is here.

358
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,440
I fixed the room.

359
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,850
I'm here to return the bamboo stick to you.

360
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Stop it, kids.

361
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,290
Here.

362
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000
It's such a big yard.

363
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,760
in such a big yard.

364
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,200
Normally,

365
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Lord Xu and the delinquents often come to help.

366
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
For these trivial things,

367
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,040
I did it myself.

368
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,880
This place is sponsored by Xu Ziqi alone.

369
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,440
Lord Xu has brought everything

370
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,720
to me.

371
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,200
Look at these old furniture

372
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,960
They were replaced from Yifang.

373
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,960
Look at these clothes.

374
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,680
fabrics,

375
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,600
This is also from other places.

376
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,680
Some were donated by others

377
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,200
What about old people's clothes?

378
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,960
Not bad.

379
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
How long can you wear a suitable one?

380
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
Look at these kids

381
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,680
These are for adults who can't wear them.

382
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,000
So it can only be stitched and mended.

383
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,130
Move over there.

384
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,900
Come on.

385
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
Enough.

386
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Don't you have a profitable business here?

387
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,880
You can't even earn money.

388
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,040
How can we earn money?

389
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,920
This tree looks weird.

390
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,280
Okay, have fun.

391
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,600
Be careful.

392
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
Miss Zheng.

393
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,240
This tree

394
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,240
was planted by Lord Xu's grandpa

395
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,770
when he moved into the yard.

396
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,920
Just like the plaque behind you.

397
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,360
was written by Lord Xu's grandfather.

398
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,100
It's full of branches.

399
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,120
It's been hundreds of years.

400
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,000
This tree is full of branches and leaves.

401
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
But the Xu family

402
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,040
only Lord Xu is left alone.

403
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,880
Now the people of Peace are prosperous.

404
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,680
Xu Ziqi is no longer alone.

405
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
Lord Xu

406
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,680
I hate to call him "prosperous".

407
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,400
Just like all famous doctors

408
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,860
hopes that there are no doctors in the world.

409
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Lord Xu wants peace and peace the most.

410
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,680
Don't let others be prosperous.

411
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Then the world will be peaceful.

412
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,440
Xu Ziqi is so poor.

413
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,210
he still tries his best to maintain peace.

414
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,280
It's not easy.

415
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,720
Everyone has something they want to stick to.

416
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
Lord Xu is a wise person.

417
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,200
I think

418
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,480
he knows what he wants to do.

419
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,680
By the way,

420
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,040
why did you take part in the beauty selection?

421
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,280
I can't tell you.

422
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,880
We can't escape.

423
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,960
Forget it.

424
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,720
Why don't you

425
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,120
how to make money.

426
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,680
Stand higher.

427
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Be careful, don't prick your hands.

428
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,720
Look at this. Pull the seeds out.

429
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,680
Try it

430
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,760
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

431
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,960
I've observed carefully.

432
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,000
What do you usually do?

433
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,440
I found that there are many ways

434
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
to turn what you do

435
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,160
into money.

436
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,960
Really? Really?

437
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,680
Take a look. I'm just passing by.

438
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Wash them and cut them. They're all full.

439
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
No matter when,

440
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
people want to release their hands.

441
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,880
To put it bluntly, you're slacking off.

442
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,200
Thank you.

443
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Come and see

444
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,880
The fat chicken from deep mountains

445
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
Eat the most fat and beautiful earthworms

446
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
and enjoy the hottest sunshine.

447
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,440
Drink the clearest spring

448
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,600
and the most delicious local eggs.

449
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:44,920
Look.

450
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,200
In any era,

451
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,040
Chinese food genes

452
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,040
is emphasizing nature.

453
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,120
Fresh.

454
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,880
Take it.

455
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,760
I'll take this.

456
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,680
I want two too.

457
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,740
The new-style sugar-coated haws are starting to sell.

458
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Just order whatever you want.

459
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,490
How many skewers do you want

460
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,530
You even sell one fruit?

461
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Have a look.

462
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,300
Do you want to eat this?

463
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,720
No matter when,

464
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,920
customers want their preferences to be respected.

465
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,240
They have the right to choose.

466
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,520
Me too.

467
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,960
Boss, have one.

468
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,360
I want this.

469
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,200
It's time to close.

470
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,240
I don't know if these will work.

471
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,410
Let's go.

472
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
Ms. Zheng.

473
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,520
You're back.

474
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,640
We made six taels today.

475
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,200
Awesome!

476
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,000
How much did you earn?

477
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,120
Let me tell you.

478
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,480
We've earned six taels today.

479
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
Not bad.

480
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,000
It's enough for all of us for half a month.

481
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,200
Let me tell you.

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,920
we should

483
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,160
should thank Ms. Xiao Zheng.

484
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
Thank you.

485
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
It's nothing.

486
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,600
You're so smart, Miss Kui.

487
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,280
Okay, let's eat.

488
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,720
Let's eat.

489
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,840
Time to eat.

490
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,240
Boss.

491
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
The competition will be over after today.

492
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,300
Let me help you.

493
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,600
Let's go back.

494
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
Besides, you've been

495
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,840
for three days.

496
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,400
We're not geckos.

497
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,960
Boss, your mouth is crooked.

498
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,720
Yes, this is a happy event.

499
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,130
Smile together.

500
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,840
Why do you always want to run away

501
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,720
Because I have to run.

502
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,680
Is there a dog hole?

503
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,000
Tell me.

504
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,480
Brother Xu, you're right.

505
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,880
Xiao Zheng finally killed me.

506
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,760
Brother Xu.

507
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,880
Xu Ziqi, you coward.

508
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,440
How dare you hide on the roof?

509
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
Get down!

510
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,920
Get down!

511
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,680
Miss Xiao Zheng!

512
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,200
Miss Xiao Zheng.

513
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,880
Come down.

514
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,280
Miss Xiao Zheng.

515
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,740
Don't be like this.

516
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,040
You've escaped.

517
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
Let it be.

518
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,440
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

519
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,240
Just stay.

520
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,000
We love each other and family.

521
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,280
Let's go.

522
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,440
Family.

523
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,040
Let's go.

524
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Sister Xiao Zheng finally killed me.

525
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,640
Brother Xu.

526
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,440
Xu Ziqi!

527
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,560
Why did you stop me from going back to Chang'an?

528
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,720
Ancestor, why are you here?

529
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,080
When the flowers bloom and the moon is full,

530
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,640
I

531
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,640
a secret to you.

532
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,280
about your future husband.

533
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,360
He is in Chang'an.

534
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,680
What else?

535
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
It's a secret.

536
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,000
Why don't you understand?

537
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,240
I understand.

538
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
The secret cannot be revealed.

539
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,450
It's good to have a husband.

540
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,720
Your future husband.

541
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,520
He has a cinnabar mole on his chest.

542
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,440
Ancestor,

543
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,760
Didn't you say it's a secret?

544
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,640
A secret? How do you explain this?

545
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,160
Chance.

546
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,000
Chance

547
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,200
It's random.

548
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,880
Look.

549
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,960
I took after two of them, understand?

550
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,040
I don't understand.

551
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,810
It's so hard to understand.

552
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,600
It's a secret indeed.

553
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,440
It's gone again.

554
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Xu Ziqi.

555
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,400
Xu Ziqi.

556
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
I know you are here.

557
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,920
Xu Ziqi!

558
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Come out.

559
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,720
It's less than an hour

560
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,200
is less than an hour away.

561
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,720
This is very important to me.

562
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,360
I must go.

563
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,640
Boss.

564
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,400
What should we do

565
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
What should we do?

566
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,690
Bring me the net.

567
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,720
If she flies out,

568
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,520
we'll tie her up and send her back.

569
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,640
Xu Ziqi.

570
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,960
I always know what I want to do.

571
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,040
That's what I want to do.

572
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,920
This is my path.

573
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,120
I have to finish this path.

574
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,200
Boss, why don't you reply her?

575
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
How can this be?

576
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,360
I've been here for three days.

577
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,940
But peace and joy are your territory.

578
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
So,

579
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
you would rather die than let me go back to Chang'an.

580
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,040
right?

581
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:36,840
Boss.

582
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,760
It's so high.

583
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,360
If you fall down from the top,

584
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,520
and still can't stand,

585
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,200
This is really something.

586
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,360
Get someone to hold her.

587
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,000
How?

588
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,040
Xu Ziqi.

589
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,680
Business

590
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,240
is my life.

591
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,970
It's the reason I can live in Chang'an.

592
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,200
Now I have no reason.

593
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,240
Xu Ziqi.

594
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,720
I have nowhere to go.

595
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,680
Great!

596
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,760
It's okay.

597
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,490
Who are you to decide for me?

598
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,300
It's for your own good.

599
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
For me?

600
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,600
This is my life.

601
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,240
I have the final say

602
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,520
Not you.

603
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,200
You don't understand the danger.

604
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,920
This matter

605
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,000
can't be done

606
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,200
with no background.

607
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,160
Tell me.

608
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,200
Why do you have to choose this Oiran?

609
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,000
Swing so high.

610
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,730
You'll fall to death, you know?

611
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,520
Have a brain, okay?

612
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm not threatening you.

613
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,850
It took me so much effort

614
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,120
to take such a big risk

615
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,440
to take you away from Chang'an.

616
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,840
Why must you go back?

617
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,960
Xu Ziqi.

618
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,840
What is the most regretful thing

619
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,600
in your life?

620
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,600
Let me ask you.

621
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,600
If God

622
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,420
let you escape from death,

623
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,489
and give you a chance to start over.

624
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,400
You can make up for

625
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,440
what you regret the most in your life.

626
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
what would you do?

627
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm very lucky

628
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,580
to have a chance like this.

629
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,239
I can start over.

630
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,840
to make up for my mistakes.

631
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,719
Since I escaped to Chang'an,

632
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,400
I still made mistakes.

633
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
But at least I know what I did wrong.

634
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,920
I can make up for it.

635
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,120
I also try to make up for it.

636
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,360
Xu Ziqi.

637
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,460
Can you understand this feeling?

638
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,480
It...

639
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,720
It's strange.

640
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,440
but sometimes it's painful.

641
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,800
But isn't life like this?

642
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,210
I don't want to miss this chance again.

643
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,600
Whether it's you,

644
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,720
or anyone,

645
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,520
has no right to take away this opportunity from me.

646
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,820
Are you going to the dangerous place?

647
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,600
Yes.

648
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,280
A tiger's den.

649
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,880
Whether it's right or wrong,

650
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,960
life or death

651
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,720
is my choice.

652
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,220
I'm willing to bear it.

653
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,650
It's harder than a tiger's den.

654
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,040
Are you going too?

655
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,600
Xu Ziqi.

656
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,360
Nothing is easy.

657
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,880
I remember when I first came to Chang'an,

658
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,080
I had no one to rely on.

659
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,720
and no place to stay.

660
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,840
You saved me.

661
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,680
I was kicked out of Chang'an and almost eaten by a wild dog.

662
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,960
You saved me.

663
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,280
You saved me without a partner in the first competition.

664
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,600
No cow in the second round.

665
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,920
you saved me.

666
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,360
I believe no matter how difficult it is,

667
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,580
you will protect me

668
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,880
you will protect me, right?

669
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,320
It's too late to sign up.

670
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
It takes at least an hour

671
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,400
to the registration place.

672
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,240
Yes. What should we do?

673
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
It's too far.

674
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,320
That's all.

675
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
Since you saved me,

676
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,560
save me one more time. Don't stop me.

677
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Riding a horse is faster than walking.

678
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Let me see you off.

679
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,400
Get the horse ready.

680
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,120
Yes.

681
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,640
My lord.

682
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
Hua Xiao Zheng really doesn't want to participate in the competition?

683
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,200
I think so.

684
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,620
We don't have time.

685
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,860
Congratulations.

686
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,680
This has really eliminated a major hidden danger.

687
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,960
Hua Xiao Zheng reports.

688
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,690
Hua Xiaotong

689
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,480
It's useless if you're late.

690
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
I'm not late.

691
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,360
Zheng, it's too late.

692
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,960
Li.

693
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,690
Xiao Zheng has arrived.

694
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,280
Time's up.

695
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
The rules are confirmed.

696
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,600
Time stops when the incense burns out.

697
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,560
The incense is not burnt out.

698
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,620
We still have time.

699
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,080
Hua Xiaochi made it in time.

700
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,560
Yes.

701
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,280
We can't let her become the Oiran. Let's go. Let's go.

702
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,000
You and I

703
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,520
have no right to make any decision for anyone.

704
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,400
Guards!

705
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,960
Xu Ziqi!

706
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Xu Ziqi!

707
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,440
Go!

708
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,880
Ziqi

709
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,400
Hurry up.

710
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Hurry.

711
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:06,920
Sir!

712
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
We did it!

713
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,960
We did it!

714
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,320
This...

715
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,920
It's...

716
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
It's really you.

717
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,880
Your future husband is in Chang'an.

718
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He has a cinnabar mole on his chest.

719
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,960
The final of the Oiran election in ten days.

720
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,160
Candidate Gu Jin'er.

721
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,280
Hua Xiao Zheng.

722
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,180
This...

723
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,240
Separating hatred.

724
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,170
Call me Mr. Fang.

725
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
It's inappropriate without rules.

726
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,530
What's up, Mr. Fang?

727
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,160
What's wrong with you today?

728
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,400
Why do you look so down?

729
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,690
What is this?

730
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,000
The competition is coming.

731
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,720
Nervous. Read the dialogue novel and relax.

732
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,920
Nervous? You signed up?

733
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm just nervous.

734
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,000
I didn't say no.

735
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,760
You...

736
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,360
Give up then.

737
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
or stop.

738
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,800
What?

739
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,080
Why don't you lose to Jin'er on purpose?

740
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,800
Fine.

741
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,760
On purpose?

742
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,560
Yes.

743
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,720
[Even if you risk your life,]

744
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,760
you may not win.

745
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,040
So you are here to persuade me to quit?

746
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

747
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,720
If you win,

748
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,120
what should I do?

749
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,840
That means

750
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,000
you also think I'm not to be underestimated.

751
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,960
Look at how proud you are.

752
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,720
Do you know

753
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,760
how much trouble

754
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,840
to my lord?

755
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,440
Now Zhang Gui has turned against Gu Jin'er.

756
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,600
As the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

757
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,360
I also prefer Gu Jin'er to win.

758
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,780
Gu Jin'er is more like the Oiran in people's hearts.

759
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,040
But you don't.

760
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,640
Why not?

761
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,440
Do you know what the final round is?

762
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,320
Clothes, clothes and makeup.

763
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,440
Gu Jin'er relies on heroes,

764
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,640
not herself.

765
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,340
Do you really think

766
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,320
Gu Jin'er can become the most beautiful woman in Chang'an

767
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,640
thanks to the hero.

768
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,000
Then why Gu Jin'er?

769
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,960
Not anyone else.

770
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,000
It seems

771
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,920
You really don't know.

772
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,650
Why do you use clothes as a test?

773
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,960
Since you don't know,

774
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,820
I'm afraid losing is inevitable.

775
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,600
It's fine if you lose.

776
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,760
I told you before.

777
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,520
I have a big family.

778
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,800
I can support you.

779
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,840
I know

780
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,040
I know it all.

781
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,720
The competition is over.

782
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Come back with me.

783
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,080
What if I win?

784
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,440
Stop dreaming.

785
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,210
People can have dreams,

786
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,080
but don't fantasize.

787
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,400
Are you done?

788
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,560
Please leave.

789
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,840
My lord.

790
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,640
This...

791
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,480
This...

792
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,480
What is this?

793
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,880
This is...

794
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,320
I’m going to

795
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,720
to the girls at Pingkang Fang tomorrow.

796
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,160
Are you

797
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,440
have improper thoughts about me?

798
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,440
No.

799
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,040
My conscience.

800
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,600
I don't want

801
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,530
create literature.

802
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,320
Creation, you know?

803
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
Yang Debiao also does creation.

804
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm also good at Four Books and Five Classics.

805
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,920
Everyone knows that creation comes from life.

806
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,760
Yes. Creation comes from desires.

807
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,600
You've always been loyal to my lord.

808
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,960
Your eyes are full of desire.

809
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,080
Desire?

810
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,700
Why didn't I see it?

811
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,880
What the hell?

812
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,440
Forget it. I know Husppy is here.

813
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,900
You're too shy to admit it.

814
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,400
But don't forget that we haven't met for a long time yesterday.

815
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,730
I tried to stop you from checking the game,

816
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,770
but you still...

817
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,880
still...

818
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,760
You still can't control your beast desires.

819
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,040
and stripped off his clothes.

820
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,000
If it weren't for the crowd,

821
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
you would have...

822
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,600
to me.

823
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Separate hatred.

824
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,760
What are you thinking?

825
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,290
It doesn't matter what I think.

826
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,560
I know

827
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,240
in your mind.

828
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,140
Ten days later,

829
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
come back with me.

830
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
and be my woman.

831
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,960
This...

832
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,650
What's going on?

833
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,600
The domineering young master fell in love with me.

834
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,640
Why can't Xu Ziqi

835
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,920
a domineering young man?

836
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,480
That makes sense.

837
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,600
Why did Gu Jin'er

838
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,800
become the Oiran for three consecutive years?

839
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,560
What do women in Chang'an like?

840
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,160
All right.

841
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,280
How dare you steal Mr. Bang's clothes in public?

842
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,860
I've been working hard to be a perfect Oiran.

843
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,280
to work with Mr. Bang.

844
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,960
She...

845
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,800
Who does she think she is?

846
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,240
Calm down. Calm down.

847
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,400
Sit here.

848
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,280
Jin'er.

849
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,560
Do you know why I left the women's country

850
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,840
I came all the way to Chang'an?

851
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,040
I remember you said

852
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,760
In a women's country, you should respect the gender's gender's gender's gender. In a woman's country, you should respect the gender's gender's character.

853
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,960
A woman respects a man as a humble.

854
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,920
and was humiliated.

855
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,960
There is another reason

856
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,480
there is another reason.

857
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,920
I never told you.

858
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,170
In the women's country,

859
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,360
I'm a royal.

860
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
as a prince.

861
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,440
and living a luxurious life.

862
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,240
But I don't feel happy at all

863
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,640
I don't feel happy at all.

864
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,760
Jin'er.

865
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,880
I know you've been selling yourself here

866
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,100
and suffered a lot.

867
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,400
You want to find a powerful

868
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,800
for the rest of your life.

869
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,320
I can understand.

870
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,620
But Jin'er,

871
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,320
money sometimes

872
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,520
is not a necessity for happiness.

873
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,960
Maybe

874
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,000
bring misfortune.

875
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,960
You're right.

876
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,530
All these years,

877
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,200
the business committee has done

878
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,040
are shameful.

879
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,000
But if you still

880
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,440
the Oiran of this year,

881
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,560
you still need to get involved.

882
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,240
But a hero...

883
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,720
With my identity,

884
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,320
I really don't know

885
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,960
I really don't know

886
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,920
what else I can do

887
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,920
to make Mr. Fang

888
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,800
think highly of me.

889
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
I have no choice.

890
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,440
You think so?

891
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,120
Hua Xiao Zheng thinks so too.

892
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,920
She has no choice.

893
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,000
She sells flowers

894
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,960
She sells dialogue novels and tea melon seeds.

895
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,080
She has many choices.

896
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,290
Brother, hang in there.

897
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,080
Hang in there.

898
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,120
Hold on

899
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,400
Hang in there.

900
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,880
Hang in there.

901
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,920
Hang in there.

902
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,120
I...

903
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,160
I will hold on.

904
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,360
I must let Jin'er know

905
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,320
I'll take care of her

906
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,320
I'll protect her.

907
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,760
Yes, stick to it.

908
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,360
Come on, bro.

909
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,000
Come on, bro.

910
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,440
Hurry.

911
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
You can stabilize it.

912
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,000
Steady, bro.

913
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,160
Take it.

914
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,800
In this world,

915
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,800
in this world

916
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,250
They all think they have no choice.

917
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,440
If I can jump out and watch,

918
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,640
the world is vast.

919
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,720
There is a way out

920
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,560
will have another future.

921
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,600
I believe no matter how difficult it is,

922
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,940
you will protect me

923
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,120
You'll protect me too, right? Right?
