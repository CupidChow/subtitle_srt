1
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,479
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:56,940
Get out.

3
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,360
Why did he go to the restaurant? He went to the restaurant.

4
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
What restaurant?

5
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
I saw you and Husppy

6
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
from the restaurant.

7
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,960
Sir.

8
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,079
There's no tea in your room.

9
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
Why do you

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,200
on your body?

11
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,340
You won't admit it if you go there.

12
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,140
It's not a guilty conscience.

13
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
What is it?

14
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,800
Let me guess.

15
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
Did you come to see me?

16
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm not telling you about my trip to the restaurant.

17
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm afraid you'll do this

18
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
because you're obsessed with me.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,480
I went there for you.

20
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
I was so happy.

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm so happy

22
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm crazy for you.

23
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
Calm down.

24
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
I can't calm down.

25
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,120
Sir.

26
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,920
Do you know how handsome you are?

27
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,640
Sir.

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,920
Do you know

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
You're so rich.

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,079
Sir.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,520
Do you know how talented you are?

32
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
I know.

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,079
This is why all the women in Chang'an

34
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,079
in Chang'an.

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,120
But now,

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,100
Please control yourself.

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Sir! Sir! Sir!

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,920
Chairman!

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,520
We're meant to be.

40
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,120
Destiny?

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,400
Sir.

42
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
I made this mistake

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,040
to meet you.

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Chairman.

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Let's go to the top of our lives together.

46
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,519
Top.

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,079
Top?

48
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,450
Look, Mr. Chairman.

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm smart in business.

50
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,000
I built Noble Lady Street

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,760
to build Noble Lady Street

52
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,820
the most popular commercial street.

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,560
You are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm an expert in business.

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,810
If we work together,

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,240
we'll reach the peak of our life.

57
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,800
A woman

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,320
is too close to the Chamber of Commerce.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,980
with the Chamber of Commerce.

60
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,300
You scoundrel.

61
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,800
Don't be so rude to my lord.

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
Chairman Bang is yours now.

63
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,200
From now on, it's mine.

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,000
No, Lord Bang belongs to everyone.

65
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,800
It's ours!

66
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Bastard!

67
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
Ever since I met Hua Xiaochi,

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
I haven't slept well for a day.

69
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,640
How could I say that to her today?

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,200
Calm down.

71
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Calm down.

72
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,440
I need to review.

73
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
I came to Chang'an

74
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,960
I was poor.

75
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,580
I have no one to rely on.

76
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,760
Bare-handed.

77
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
How can I do that?

78
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,060
the best female merchant in Tang?

79
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,960
There are

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,440
in the middle.

81
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
Based on all conditions,

82
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,000
First,

83
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,520
Knowing the room and separating hatred

84
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,960
Second,

85
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,490
Let's make a fortune together.

86
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,680
Three steps.

87
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,020
[He's the one who got married.] [He's the one who got married.]

88
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,200
But yesterday,

89
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
didn't acknowledge my business talent.

90
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,200
Is it not enough?

91
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
Looks like we need to find a good job.

92
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,760
Beauty is reliable.

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
But the place has changed.

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,610
the preferences have changed.

95
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,850
I need to be a detective.

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,900
Where can I be a detective?

97
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
There are many girls.

98
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,640
I know.

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,690
Where are you going?

100
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,940
Pingkang Fang.

101
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,940
I knew you wouldn’t go to a good place.

102
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,080
My lord, the sedan chair is ready.

103
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
Where are we going today?

104
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,299
Pingkang Fang.

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,440
Why did your lord go to such a place?

106
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,280
He's going to work.

107
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,450
Where are you going?

108
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,680
Business.

109
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,800
President, I was just kidding.

110
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,280
You and those

111
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,440
who went to Pingkang Fang

112
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
is different.

113
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,850
The adults are so mad at you.

114
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,800
Shut up!

115
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,420
Get on the sedan

116
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
On the way. Get in.

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
But sir,

118
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,800
Don't you think this sedan chair

119
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,200
a little...

120
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,480
It's small.

121
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Husppy

122
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,440
Yes.

123
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Get a double sedan chair.

124
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,130
I don't want to get too close to her.

125
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,220
Watch out, my lord! Watch out!

126
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Rise the sedan

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,960
Why are you going to Pingkang Bang?

128
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Stay away from me.

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,560
The sedan chair is only this big.

130
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,440
It's not far.

131
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Mr. Chairman.

132
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,560
Did you fall for my sweet smile?

133
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
by my sweet smile?

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,020
I don't believe

135
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,440
you have the beauty of my smile.

136
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,560
Smile then.

137
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,960
Let's go.

138
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,280
Well...

139
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,040
The chairman's cold face is very handsome.

140
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,440
If you smile, you'll ruin this beauty.

141
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
What do you think?

142
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,960
Mr. Chairman.

143
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm here

144
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,080
to share my beauty skills with you.

145
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,320
Then why are you here?

146
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,680
Where do you want to go?

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,080
to report to you?

148
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,840
Aren't you going to protect me?

149
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,320
Why?

150
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Do you really think you can win his heart

151
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
you can win his heart?

152
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
Sir.

153
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,080
Don't you think she's scary? She's scary.

154
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm so scared.

155
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,960
Hua Xiaochi.

156
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,480
Aren't you looking for your Mr. Right?

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,200
Why are you here again?

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,530
in a willow alley again?

159
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,920
Mr. Bang.

160
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,600
Mr. Bang is here too.

161
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,200
And I'm here for business.

162
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm here to check on you. I'm here to check on you.

163
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,460
You won't understand.

164
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Li, why are you here?

165
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
I have work to do.

166
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Yes.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,180
Mr. Bang said he came to Pingkang Fang for business.

168
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,920
right?

169
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,560
Li,

170
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
You have work to do in Pingkang Fang.

171
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,970
It’s confidential.

172
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,520
I can't tell you here.

173
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
I have something else to do.

174
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,820
I'll get going.

175
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,140
Goodbye, Mr. Bang.

176
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,020
Aren't you coming in for some tea?

177
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,920
No.

178
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,560
Mr. Bang.

179
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,440
You came all the way to Pingkang Fang.

180
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,440
Are you here to see me off?

181
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,480
You wish. You wish.

182
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Keep your image.

183
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,160
Xu Ziqi, what are you doing here?

184
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,080
I...

185
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,720
I'm here to see if you've done something wrong again.

186
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
Besides,

187
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,850
you haven't done what you promised me.

188
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,130
You want me to find you a wife again?

189
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,040
Fine.

190
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,810
You should at least cooperate with me.

191
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Lord Xu,

192
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,800
If you want a good girl,

193
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,920
you can't let her help you.

194
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,440
This evil behavior

195
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,800
can be trusted.

196
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,840
Miss Jin'er.

197
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
You have a point.

198
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,560
Let's go.

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,680
Come on.

200
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Come on.

201
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
Miss Jin'er's hands

202
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,560
is so beautiful.

203
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,490
You're indeed the top star.

204
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Miss Jin'er.

205
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Lord Xu is a reliable man.

206
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Be a good man.

207
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,840
What?

208
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,360
You...

209
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,840
Lord Xu.

210
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,480
I just want a successful woman like you

211
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,160
beautiful and rich.

212
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,200
Do you also want

213
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,440
a strong boy

214
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,340
to rely on for the rest of his life.

215
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,800
You can’t stay

216
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,840
for the rest of your life.

217
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,800
Miss Hua is right.

218
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

219
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,320
It doesn't make sense.

220
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,850
What are you talking about?

221
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,720
Baby.

222
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,780
Listen to me first.

223
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
Miss Hua is right.

224
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,780
But you forgot the most important question.

225
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,440
Everyone in Chang'an knows

226
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,040
the man Jin'er loves

227
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,800
It's Chairman Bang.

228
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,920
Mr. Bang will be with me.

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
I think Mr. Xu and you are a good match.

230
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
A pair of Chang'an.

231
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,330
Come on. Come on.

232
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Xu Ziqi.

233
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,160
I'll help you find a wife. Okay. Okay.

234
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,480
Hit me.

235
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,740
You have to protect me.

236
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,920
Drag him out and beat him.

237
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,600
Yes.

238
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,720
You...

239
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
Don't.

240
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,320
Don't.

241
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,680
Xu Ziqi, I'm helping you find a wife.

242
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,720
Let go of me!

243
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,280
Xu Ziqi!

244
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,800
Move! Move! Move!

245
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,560
Are you okay?

246
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,840
Don't scare me.

247
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,890
Hua Xiaochi.

248
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,770
Are you out of your mind?

249
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,840
I was saving you.

250
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,040
You almost had a stitch.

251
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,920
What happened to you?

252
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,480
I don't know what's wrong with me.

253
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
I've been practicing martial arts for 16 years.

254
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,250
I've never encountered such a situation.

255
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,080
Do you feel suffocated

256
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,920
I can't lift it up at once.

257
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,840
Are you dizzy?

258
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,280
Spin the sky

259
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,530
I feel like I'm going to faint anytime.

260
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Do you feel chest tightness and shortness of breath?

261
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,440
A big rock

262
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,720
on the chest.

263
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,080
Are you angry?

264
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,160
Who do you think made me angry?

265
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,560
I guess

266
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,160
I guess you're angry that you're too ordinary

267
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,260
that you can't marry a rich woman.

268
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,599
Are you okay?

269
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,440
Where are you touching?

270
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,640
I think you have chest tightness and breath.

271
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,680
I can help you.

272
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,720
Stop!

273
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm fine.

274
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
I just want to see

275
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,960
Are you really recovered?

276
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,840
It seems true.

277
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

278
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,220
Hua Xiao Zheng.

279
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
I'll give you one last chance.

280
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
to tie the red thread for me.

281
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,960
Otherwise,

282
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Just cash it to me.

283
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,260
That's enough.

284
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,680
100 taels of gold.

285
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,440
One coin is missing.

286
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,680
I'll kick you out of Chang'an

287
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,200
I'll kick you out of Chang'an myself.

288
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,760
100 taels.

289
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,360
Are you blackmailing me?

290
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes, it's blackmail.

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,360
The rules of you coming and going

292
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,290
It's just that you're not kind and I'm not righteous.

293
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
I'm not convinced.

294
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,960
Really?

295
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,040
I find I can't follow your rules.

296
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,920
So just follow my rules.

297
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,920
This is your last chance.

298
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Or

299
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,240
It's 200 taels.

300
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,920
Any problem?

301
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
I think it's fair.

302
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,760
Okay. Deal.

303
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Are you threatening me?

304
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,840
I don't feel well.

305
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,770
I have chest tightness.

306
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,440
I can't breathe.

307
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,240
My lord, it's late.

308
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,040
Why don't you go back to your room and study?

309
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,770
Don't hurt your precious eyes.

310
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,850
It's quiet here.

311
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,880
The room is noisy.

312
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,680
By the way,

313
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,960
I asked you

314
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,360
for dinner.

315
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
As you ordered.

316
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
20 dishes in total.

317
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,480
Are you ready?

318
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,240
Yes.

319
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,960
My lord.

320
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,520
Yes, tonight.

321
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
Who is coming?

322
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,600
Just me.

323
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,920
One person.

324
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
20 dishes.

325
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
I want to change my taste.

326
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,240
Mr. Bang, I'm home.

327
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Hello. Hello.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,680
Report!

329
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,360
Braised pigeon.

330
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,600
Yulan soup.

331
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,040
Feels good

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,050
Chicken shredded cucumber

333
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
Come on. Come on.

334
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,040
Go on.

335
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,360
Longjing bamboo mushroom.

336
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,680
Fragrant apple.

337
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,410
Snow Mountain Plum.

338
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,900
Here you go. Thank you.

339
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,160
You're eating a lot, Mr. Chairman. Let's go.

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,760
Let's go.

341
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,920
Nothing.

342
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,720
These are the most famous food in Chang'an.

343
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,280
Take your time.

344
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,440
Have you had dinner?

345
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,120
I had three pancakes.

346
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,040
Are you full?

347
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,680
I ate three pancakes.

348
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,120
I only had two pancakes.

349
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,140
She'll be stuffed to death if she eats three.

350
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm a little full.

351
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Enjoy. I'm going back to my room.

352
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
See you tomorrow.

353
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
I told you to stop.

354
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,290
Keep reporting.

355
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:01,960
Louder.

356
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
Almond Buddha Hand.

357
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,200
Tofu.

358
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,100
Golden Steamed Dumpling.

359
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,640
Shrimp.

360
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,520
Braised Red Shrimp.

361
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,560
What's wrong?

362
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,200
Finish this meal today.

363
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,370
You don't have to find me tomorrow.

364
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't you have dinner?

365
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,040
I'm hungry.

366
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,300
I'm hungry.

367
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
Let's get to work.

368
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,240
I went to the east and west market today.

369
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,640
I wonder if the city's rouge is good

370
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
You bought so much.

371
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,040
Let's study it.

372
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,400
It's not very colourful.

373
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,940
It's not that good. It's good. It's good.

374
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,660
Look at this. Look at this.

375
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,120
It's quite eye-catching.

376
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,580
The powder has fallen off.

377
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
This is the rouge of Chang'an.

378
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
Coming.

379
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,480
Come here, everyone.

380
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,040
Marry him. Marry him.

381
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,040
Marrying him won't hurt you.

382
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
I won't fall for it if I marry him.

383
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,280
He's handsome

384
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,680
He has great limbs.

385
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,000
Work with love

386
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
Speak with your heart.

387
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,840
and observe the situation.

388
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,280
The government's salary

389
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,960
in the imperial court.

390
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I heard that Lord Xu has been on a blind date for a long time.

391
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,200
but he doesn't have a suitable match.

392
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,600
Is it demanding?

393
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,960
A little red in the green

394
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,400
Maybe Lord Xu is waiting for you.

395
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Do you have any standards?

396
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
Destiny?

397
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
Wonderful.

398
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,290
I set up this place today

399
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,480
to fulfill this unparalleled marriage.

400
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,680
Lord Xu, I don't need to introduce more.

401
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,280
He is a good man.

402
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,640
Loyal and loyal.

403
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,920
with both literature and martial arts.

404
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,680
Now I want to find a girl who can get along with me.

405
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,480
to spend the rest of my life with.

406
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Here is my sincerity.

407
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,480
I just need to pay for the tea.

408
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,720
Line up if you want.

409
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,680
Let's make an appointment to meet Lord Xu.

410
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,840
Every girl

411
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,520
have two hours

412
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,480
to have a private chat with Lord Xu.

413
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,680
Come on, queue up, girls.

414
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,840
Come on.

415
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,240
Thank you, ladies.

416
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,960
please fill out the information

417
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,220
during the interview.

418
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,200
How old are you?

419
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,920
Is your face oily?

420
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Do you wash your face in the morning?

421
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,880
in the morning?

422
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,240
What kind of cosmetics do you like?

423
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
lipstick, eyebrow brush, the more detailed, the better.

424
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,200
Put it here. Fill it yourself.

425
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,880
Xu Ziqi.

426
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,680
I have to thank you

427
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,480
for giving me such a good chance.

428
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
to gather all the girls in Chang'an.

429
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Those who can afford the registration fee

430
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
are free money.

431
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,480
They have the purchase power.

432
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,120
Killing two birds with one stone. Killing two birds with one stone.

433
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm so smart.

434
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,600
Here we go. Here we go.

435
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,680
Elder Yi.

436
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,440
Lord Xu.

437
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,780
Please come in.

438
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,760
The Oiran election is coming.

439
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,280
Thank you, Mr. Bang.

440
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,680
It looks like you've lost some weight.

441
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,840
It's my duty.

442
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
We should take care of it.

443
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Besides the selection of the Oiran,

444
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,440
and your new dowry maid.

445
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,300
to torture you.

446
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,280
I saw that the young master fell in love with me.

447
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,680
I remember

448
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,440
are also thinner.

449
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,250
Please investigate it.

450
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,680
That woman has nothing to do with me.

451
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,640
I just took her in Chang'an

452
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,120
so I took her in.

453
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,360
It's almost lunchtime.

454
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,840
They're all decorating.

455
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,040
Why don't you stay for dinner?

456
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,400
Okay.

457
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,180
I'm here. I'm here.

458
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,600
Well...

459
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,970
Please go to the toilet.

460
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
This is...

461
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,050
Here you go. Here you go.

462
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,200
This is yours.

463
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Thank you.

464
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,600
Don't worry.

465
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,280
Thank you.

466
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,240
Miss Yang.

467
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,500
Help yourself.

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,640
Miss Yang,

469
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,240
If you want to go on another blind date with Lord Xu,

470
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,200
just tell me.

471
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
I'll arrange it for you.

472
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,520
Don't come here.

473
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm not here for a blind date.

474
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,920
I'm here for a blind date. Okay.

475
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,480
This is...

476
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,240
You...

477
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,400
in public

478
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,480
to go on a blind date for the Xu family.

479
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
He's a despicable man.

480
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,440
What did your lady say?

481
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,970
She said you're shameless.

482
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
Look at you.

483
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,120
It was Lord Xu's idea.

484
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,440
I just did what he wanted.

485
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,880
Is that true?

486
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,960
Lord Xu disregards his dignity.

487
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,960
He's not afraid of death.

488
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,160
He said Lord Xu is shameless.

489
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
Is this really Lord Xu's wish?

490
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,200
I have no integrity.

491
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
[and abandon the roots.]

492
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,720
Shameless!

493
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,460
Death with heavy profits.

494
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,700
You're shameless. You'll be punished sooner or later.

495
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,720
Miss Yang, you're being too harsh.

496
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,600
Too heavy.

497
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,200
Lord Wu is so bad at writing.

498
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,280
I made an appointment

499
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,360
three days later.

500
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,680
to go on a blind date with Lord Xu.

501
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,480
Is it 9 p.m. in four days?

502
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,640
Although it's not good at 9 p.m.,

503
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,960
but I've had breakfast.

504
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,090
It's still swollen.

505
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,600
But there's no other day.

506
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
It's good to have one seat.

507
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
to have a position.

508
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,000
This is the most powerful King of Hell in Chang'an.

509
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,220
A man from the Xu family is proposing.

510
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,920
Take it.

511
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,320
Thank you.

512
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,200
Hua Xiaochi

513
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,640
This is for you.

514
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,400
Here you go. Here you go.

515
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,680
Xu Ziqi is so handsome.

516
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,890
You can see him soon.

517
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,680
Yours. Yours.

518
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,600
I've signed up.

519
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,520
Thank you.

520
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,840
Am I that popular?

521
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,720
Thank you.

522
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,920
Is your skin dry or oily?

523
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,160
Can you write it down?

524
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:48,960
Okay.

525
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,240
Thank you.

526
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Thank you.

527
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,640
Take care.

528
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,720
Xu Ziqi.

529
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,780
I didn't expect you to be so charming.

530
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,680
Hua Xiaochi, you bastard!

531
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,130
A hidden weapon flying dagger.

532
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,970
Don't be afraid.

533
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,000
You want money?

534
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,420
What are you doing?

535
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,960
Xu Ziqi! Xu Ziqi!

536
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,640
Protect me!

537
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,740
Someone robbed me.

538
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,000
He has a hidden weapon flying dagger.

539
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,160
Hide behind me and let them fly me.

540
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,520
That makes sense.

541
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,960
Come on, get down.

542
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,660
Come on.

543
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,680
Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me.

544
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Lower your voice.

545
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
I'll stab you now.

546
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,740
Flying dagger!

547
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,720
You...

548
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
Xu Ziqi!

549
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,360
You are a court official.

550
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,440
to rob a good woman?

551
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,360
What a fool.

552
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,360
You...

553
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,740
Are you robbing me?

554
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,200
I'll scream.

555
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,680
I...

556
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,840
How did you get the money?

557
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,040
how you got the money?

558
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,880
Brother.

559
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,920
I'm helping you find a wife.

560
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Those girls...

561
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,570
I won't go on blind dates with them.

562
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,770
I took the money.

563
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,060
You took it too.

564
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,360
Be honest, OK?

565
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,760
You took the money, not me.

566
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,200
I didn't say anything.

567
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I'll give you more.

568
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,480
Take the money.

569
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,840
I have to kiss you.

570
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,040
This is my money at most.

571
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,740
for my reputation.

572
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,940
Why did you bury the money in the soil?

573
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,440
You can't take it with you today.

574
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,370
I'll dig it with a shovel tomorrow.

575
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,780
Hua Xiao Zheng.

576
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
You did everything

577
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,400
for money.

578
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,290
I just want to make a living.

579
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,960
I won't give others a way out.

580
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,840
I'll take the money.

581
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,680
Finish the rest yourself.

582
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
I took the money.

583
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
What should we do?

584
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,440
We'll see.

585
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,200
My money!

586
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,960
Come on everyone

587
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,600
Come on.

588
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,960
You are going on a blind date with Lord Xu tomorrow.

589
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,320
You only have one chance.

590
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,920
Beautiful makeup is a guarantee to win.

591
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,170
A woman who loves her looks.

592
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,600
In this world,

593
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,800
in this world

594
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,920
doesn't care about

595
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,400
for the man he likes.

596
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,840
I want a more beautiful face.

597
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,960
Without the support of cosmetics.

598
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,400
Good cosmetics

599
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,159
can make us look more beautiful

600
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,520
and bad cosmetics

601
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,960
will make us look pale.

602
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,760
After 18 hours,

603
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,240
12 procedures

604
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,440
Over 300 makeup verification.

605
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,640
Finally in your questions,

606
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,280
the 47 cosmetics mentioned

607
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,880
has been selected.

608
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,640
What does Red and Black mean?

609
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,880
Red List is good.

610
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,800
It's a deal.

611
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,160
But don't use the blacklist.

612
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
You'll regret it.

613
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,640
Now I'm sharing the base makeup.

614
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,760
No.5 on the blacklist.

615
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,760
Pretty girl's honey powder.

616
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
You're all familiar with it, right?

617
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,240
Beautiful lady's honey powder.

618
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,880
Look at the makeup.

619
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,440
It's unconvincing.

620
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,880
Today I also prepared a bag of flour

621
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,840
flour.

622
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,440
Let's compare it.

623
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Who would like to have a try?

624
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,960
Me.

625
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,120
It's you. Come on.

626
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,700
Let's use the beauty honey powder first.

627
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,800
Look.

628
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,880
We actually bought a box of flour

629
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
to buy a box of flour.

630
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,080
The quality and effect

631
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,280
I can't believe it's in the cosmetics that ladies must buy.

632
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,210
among the cosmetics of all ladies.

633
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,760
Just because it's called Qiaojia,

634
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,740
Will it become a beauty if I buy it?

635
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,720
Girls, promise me

636
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,440
Throw it away now

637
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,320
That's right.

638
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,650
Thank you, miss.

639
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,600
Next,

640
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,080
I'm going to introduce the fifth place on the red list.

641
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,210
Rouge, Eighth Sister's Rouge.

642
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,880
Where's Eighth Sister's lipstick?

643
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
is Master Wang from the east of the city.

644
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
for his beloved wife.

645
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
for her beloved wife.

646
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,120
The bee wax made by Master Wang

647
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,720
It's a good product

648
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,760
that all women and children know.

649
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,920
Wang's bee wax is the base.

650
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,960
and the rose that represents love

651
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,040
which represents love.

652
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
Let's smell it again.

653
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,960
It's really nice

654
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,840
Smell it

655
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,080
Smells good

656
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,480
Very fragrant

657
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,250
Master Wang said

658
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,440
lipstick is valuable.

659
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,500
Love is priceless.

660
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,780
With a big sale of love,

661
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,960
From today onwards, we'll purchase Bayi's lipstick.

662
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
Can you get

663
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,480
20% off.

664
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,120
About the blind date tomorrow,

665
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,120
I won't...

666
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,040
tomorrow.

667
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,760
He won't.

668
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,920
Lord Xu.

669
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,680
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

670
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,040
Beauty, save the hero.

671
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,360
They look great together.

672
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,440
Ladies,

673
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,200
I haven't announced the first place on the blacklist yet.

674
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,120
Come back.

675
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,280
Now I'm going to announce

676
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,120
No.1 on the blacklist.

677
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,800
Beauty meteorite.

678
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
You must have heard of it.

679
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,440
This foundation is amazing.

680
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,480
It's the top beauty makeup artist in Chang'an.

681
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,920
the most famous

682
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,280
of heroes.

683
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,640
Surprised?

684
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,640
It's the last cosmetics I should buy.

685
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,080
Why not?

686
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,960
Thank you for your help.

687
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,120
It's nothing.

688
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I can finally repay

689
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,760
for saving my life that day.

690
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,720
Where are you going?

691
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,600
I plan to go back to my residence.

692
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
I heard that

693
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,220
a woman has found out your residence.

694
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,320
It's not safe for you to go back now.

695
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,960
If I go back now,

696
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,440
if those girls come after me,

697
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,280
it would be inappropriate.

698
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,690
Why don't you go back to the mansion with me first?

699
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,800
No.

700
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,360
I'd better go back to my place.

701
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,120
Without me,

702
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,800
who knows

703
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,440
will do.

704
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,640
She's trying to trap me to death.

705
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
I know the whole city

706
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,960
is not your own will.

707
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,080
Of course not.

708
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,120
Who would have thought

709
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,960
I'm so popular among women.

710
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,290
Unfortunately,

711
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,760
I can't find a good match.

712
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,120
You're quite handsome.

713
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,960
It's not strange that others admire you.

714
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,120
But you need to remember

715
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,560
Deok-biao is the perfect match for you.

716
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,120
Sir.

717
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,800
It doesn't matter if you don't answer Deok-biao directly.

718
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,660
Deok-biao will wait for the moment you fall in love.

719
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,040
Tell me.

720
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Who is it this time?

721
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,360
The five daughters of Lord Liu of the Ministry of Revenue

722
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,490
returned all the good-looking goods.

723
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,020
How many are these?

724
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,520
Two hours ago.

725
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,960
After Hua Xiaochi's promotion,

726
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,360
there will be

727
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,520
139 refunds.

728
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,380
Mr. Wu from Ministry of Rites sent a message.

729
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,520
We need you to get ready

730
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,640
and give the ladies and daughters an explanation.

731
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,080
Jin'er!

732
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
[Jin'er!] [Jin'er!]

733
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,960
Now,

734
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,880
we can only confront that witch.

735
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,220
and make her admit that she's talking nonsense.

736
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,960
It's not all nonsense.

737
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,850
What do you mean?

738
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,760
Although the meteorite is light and obedient,

739
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,120
but it does have a great side effect.

740
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,640
Before the production,

741
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,440
before the production.

742
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,460
Although he controlled the dosage and proportion,

743
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
but long-term use

744
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,970
is not good for your health.

745
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,440
I'm pouring the powder now.

746
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,720
to improve it.

747
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,620
But unexpectedly,

748
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,560
the witch surnamed Hua

749
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,280
by that witch Hua.

750
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,100
Where are you going, baby?

751
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,530
Remove your makeup.

752
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,490
Change clothes.

753
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,280
So luxurious

754
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,520
glowing.

755
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,800
Where are you going?

756
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,770
Jin'er is right.

757
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,080
I want to meet her myself.

758
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,160
That witch surnamed Hua.

759
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,860
Let's take a look at its composition.

760
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,600
It's lead.

761
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,840
The lead is poisonous.

762
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,400
After a long time,

763
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,840
it will directly reflect on our skin.

764
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,000
Too much lead.

765
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,360
The skin is dark at the beginning.

766
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,720
Too dry

767
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,160
The skin is not balanced.

768
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
If you use it every day it will directly affect your brain

769
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,800
You'll get dementia.

770
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,960
I hate it.

771
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,880
Alzheimer's.

772
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,360
What should I do?

773
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,720
I used it before

774
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,440
Excuse me

775
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,520
Here.

776
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,140
Young Master Ying.

777
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Young Master is so handsome.

778
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,980
Young Master Ying is so handsome.

779
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,960
Young Master.

780
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,800
Long time no see.

781
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
I know

782
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,560
what you just said.

783
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
He heard everything.

784
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,960
Sir, don't blame me for being blunt.

785
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,400
It's true that meteorite is harmful to your body.

786
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,920
But how many times do you have in your life?

787
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,080
Why don't you bloom in your best years?

788
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,280
Time is short

789
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,320
and have fun in time.

790
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,160
There are many ways to entertain in time.

791
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,880
You don't have to use poison.

792
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,560
I've studied beauty makeup for more than ten years.

793
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,440
I don't know how

794
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,160
to make your face

795
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,320
and not harm your health.

796
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,920
I'll show you

797
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,120
That's great.

798
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,440
Come on.

799
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,730
That's what I've been waiting for.

800
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,360
I can fight you now.

801
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,440
and see if there are

802
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,640
in ordinary cosmetics.

803
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,980
I wonder if you dare to accept the challenge.

804
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,440
After all, you are the best in Chang'an.

805
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,920
What should we do if we lose?

806
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,440
Yes.

807
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,640
Young Master Ying, don't be afraid to compete with her.

808
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,970
Yes. Compared with her.

809
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,760
Don't be afraid.

810
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,440
Which side are you on?

811
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,880
Now?

812
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,700
Otherwise, why didn't I close the stall?

813
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,120
I was waiting for you.

814
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,600
You set me up?

815
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,040
How could you say that?

816
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,800
I'm diligent.

817
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,120
I want to play with you.

818
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
What? You don't dare?

819
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Trust Young Master Ying. It's fine.

820
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,840
Why not?

821
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,880
I've been waiting for you to say that.

822
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,610
I've already chosen the judge.

823
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,130
Mr. Ba from Qingfeng Tea House across the street.

824
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,960
Everyone.

825
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,960
Who are these two masters from today's competition?

826
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,440
One

827
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,120
is Miss Hua whom we know very well.

828
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,160
And the other is the hero, Young Master Ying.

829
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,160
The best makeup artist in Chang'an.

830
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,240
It's bestowed by the royal family.

831
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,760
[by the royal family.]

832
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,520
Your future husband

833
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,480
He's powerful and powerful.

834
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,440
and has a great backing.

835
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,120
During the years Young Master Ying managed the beauty business,

836
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,880
through the trade between Chang'an and foreign countries.

837
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,120
There are less than 10,000 taels of silver

838
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,320
every year

839
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,840
there will be thousands of taels

840
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,000
This man asked for it from outside.

841
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,640
You've shown your deepest potential in destiny.

842
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,280
Lofty and powerful.

843
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,930
Be upright. Be upright.

844
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,400
He is upright.

845
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,920
and handsome.

846
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,840
Oh, my God. You're so handsome.

847
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,480
What are you doing? What are you doing?
