1
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,800
There is a girl in Hua Village.

2
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,600
named Hua Xiaochi.

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,360
There was a legend

4
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,880
once dominated the capital with business.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,440
and a rich family.

6
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,960
With the blessing of our ancestors,

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,960
and inherited his business talent.

8
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,080
You're a wise man

9
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,880
and become a businessman.

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,360
and achieve success.

11
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
You'll have a better future.

12
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,960
are far beyond ordinary people.

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,480
[They have to gamble.] [They have to be careful.]

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
The debts were built high.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
He even

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,120
as his wife.

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Hua Xiao Zheng will never obey.

18
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
Make a clear wish.

19
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,720
Hua Xiaotong!

20
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,960
I'm coming.

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,760
It's here. It's here. It's here.

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,130
I've seen my ancestors.

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,640
Hua Xiao Zheng.

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
I'm your ancestor.

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
I am your ancestor.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
What?

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,960
Cherish your good years.

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
and control your own life.

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,400
You will meet

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,480
a good husband.

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680
Remember,

32
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,940
you should start your career first and get married.

33
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,320
If you choose the wrong husband,

34
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,320
fate will change.

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,480
Make it clear.

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,960
Go to Chang'an.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm still alive.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,360
I'm still alive.

39
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,000
I said you jumped into the well.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,360
In order to escape marriage,

41
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
to escape marriage.

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,640
Marry me.

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
I'll kill you if you don't.

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
Get married.

45
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Servants, welcome the bride.

46
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,760
Music, dance.

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,080
What is spirit in the water?

48
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,320
Riding a white whale to chase the salmon

49
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
Walking with a girl, the Nagisa of the river

50
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
and flows in the future.

51
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,890
Madam, this is your marriage invitation.

52
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,760
Hua Xiao Zheng.

53
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,200
as the head of the Carp Alliance.

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,760
The wife of a scholar Zhang.

55
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,200
I shouldn't have died.

56
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,680
God gave me

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
another chance.

58
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
to welcome the bride.

59
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,680
Today,

60
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
the head of the Carp Alliance is getting married.

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,200
Please propose a toast to River God.

62
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,880
God of River. Cheers.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,930
Bow to River God.

64
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
River God has shown his presence.

65
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,560
The joy is unlimited, and the disease is unstoppable.

66
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,000
It's just a fish.

67
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,840
Let's welcome the groom.

68
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,880
The carp is leaping high. The director is mighty.

69
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,120
The carp is leaping high. The director is mighty.

70
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,440
Thank you.

71
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Judging from the aura,

72
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,120
he must be a strong person.

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,409
Brother.

74
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,560
Xiao Zheng, I'm your husband.

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,960
Mr. Zhang.

76
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,000
This momentum is so deceitful.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,240
Don't be shy.

78
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,200
Here.

79
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
Remember,

80
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
you should start your career first and get married.

81
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,920
If you choose the wrong husband,

82
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,560
my fate changed.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,440
I got married before I started my career.

84
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,360
I can't change my fate.

85
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Bride and groom,

86
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
To River God.

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,080
Didn't we toast just now?

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,880
Here's the thing, Xiao Zheng.

89
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,760
This is our rule.

90
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
We need to

91
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,200
to River God.

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,880
With the protection of River God,

93
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,640
can we get married.

94
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,960
Here.

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,690
What should I do?

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,130
I can't get married now.

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
God of River, bless me.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,860
River God bless us!

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,200
River God.

100
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,520
Xiao Zheng!

101
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,450
Don't come over.

102
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,760
Don't.

103
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
What are you doing?

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,320
Don't come over.

105
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
I have the fish.

106
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't move.

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,860
Xiao Zheng.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,680
Don't hurt the relic of our alliance.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,880
No, it's fine.

110
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
I won't get married.

111
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
Let me go.

112
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,000
That won't do.

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,440
We're engaged.

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,520
You're a member of the Zhang family.

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,880
If you die, you'll be the ghost of my family.

116
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,360
I...

117
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,560
I can't explain it to you.

118
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,000
I have the fish.

119
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,180
Put down the knife.

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Put it down.

121
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,320
Prepare a boat for me.

122
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,440
Can you row?

123
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,520
Boat.

124
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,200
Ship! Ship! Ship!

125
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,260
Xiao Zheng, relax.

126
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,080
Think about it.

127
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,680
the fish in your hand is innocent.

128
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,080
is innocent.

129
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,120
This is the sacred thing of our alliance.

130
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
We still need it to protect us.

131
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,850
Cut the crap.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
Hand over the boat. Hand over the fish.

133
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
River God.

134
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,200
Save River God!

135
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,160
Yuanhan,

136
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,920
Did you find him?

137
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,680
Brother.

138
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
I can't find the fish.

139
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
Keep looking.

140
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,680
Let go of me!

141
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,560
I finally

142
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,920
to swim ashore.

143
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,180
but you almost stepped on my head.

144
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,840
You...

145
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,960
Nice step.

146
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,800
Bro, let's talk about it.

147
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,720
A woman

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,080
She didn't show up sooner or later.

149
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,720
Why now?

150
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Do you want to die?

151
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm looking for a way out, boss.

152
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
He doesn't look like an accomplice.

153
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,440
So stupid.

154
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,160
Who are you?

155
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
Bring it to the detention center.

156
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
Pass what?

157
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,080
Pass

158
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,680
Right.

159
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,080
If you don't pass, you can't

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,440
in Chang'an.

161
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
then

162
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,280
change your fate?

163
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
Me neither.

164
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
He ran away from marriage.

165
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,200
How could he think so much?

166
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,200
Officer, help!

167
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,920
Let go!

168
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,600
Let go!

169
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
I hate women crying.

170
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,650
Stop crying.

171
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I'll let you live.

172
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,960
Go back to where you came from.

173
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
I have my way to live in Chang'an.

174
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,570
I want to go back too.

175
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
You can't enter Chang'an

176
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
you can't get into Chang'an.

177
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,410
Stop thinking about it.

178
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,490
Boss.

179
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,440
Keep a close watch.

180
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
The annual

181
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,840
in Chang'an.

182
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,960
Everyone on alert.

183
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
Don't let anyone

184
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,400
sneak in.

185
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,680
Yes.

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,210
Look at that.

187
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,200
Look over there.

188
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,080
I've never seen it before.

189
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,810
What's that?

190
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,560
Me too.

191
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,280
I've never seen this before.

192
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,160
Buns.

193
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,040
Fresh steamed buns!

194
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,580
Boss, give me two buns.

195
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,280
Okay.

196
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,160
This is Chang'an.

197
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,560
The capital of Tang, Chang'an.

198
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,680
Tanghulu!

199
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,480
Candied haws.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,540
Lord Xu, try it.

201
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,320
Okay.

202
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,320
Miss.

203
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
Why can I see him everywhere I go?

204
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,280
Take it.

205
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,440
Take it.

206
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,540
What are you doing?

207
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,280
Are you threatening me because I didn't go to prison?

208
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,680
I'll use you for private protection fee.

209
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
You haven't paid yet.

210
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,760
It's okay.

212
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,080
If you want to be the No.1 female merchant in Tang, you have to take the first step.

213
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,880
the first step

214
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,800
to get rid of the stumbling block in front of me.

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,560
Yae!

216
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
This is your favorite candied haws.

217
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,840
Thanks to our ancestors,

218
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,560
I came back alive today.

219
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,680
You're still up so late.

220
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,160
He must be doing something shady.

221
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,040
In broad daylight

222
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,080
How...

223
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,730
Who is it?

224
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,200
Close your eyes.

225
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,080
Rascal.

226
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,040
Where's my knife?

227
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,100
Where's the knife?

228
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,040
Let's go.

229
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,080
You pervert!

230
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,280
I didn't mean to

231
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,040
watch you take a shower.

232
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,740
You didn't manage a place.

233
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
How dare you sneak into the city?

234
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,040
I...

235
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,960
Stop talking.

236
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,200
You sneaked into the city and trespassed.

237
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Intentional assault.

238
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,330
Send him to the government office now.

239
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Why are you staring at me?

240
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,440
We're friends after all.

241
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,320
We can take care of each other in Chang'an.

242
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,400
Stop talking nonsense.

243
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,440
Otherwise,

244
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Sword is blind.

245
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't.

246
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,690
It's very useful to keep me.

247
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,460
It'll be a waste if you kill me.

248
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Look.

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,260
You remove your makeup and makeup every day.

250
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,940
Your face is getting skinned.

251
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,200
Skin

252
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,440
This is moisturizing and moisturizing water.

253
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,079
It's specially made by me.

254
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,329
moisturizing baby.

255
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,130
Look, it's done. It's done.

256
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,480
One joss stick

257
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,599
to make your skin look new.

258
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Do you want to try?

259
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,839
I'll try it too.

260
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Come on.

261
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,680
Look.

262
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,440
Oh my god.

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,960
Your face is tender.

264
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,600
It's smooth.

265
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,720
Hikaru.

266
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,080
Just now...

267
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,160
Logically,

268
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
I should be responsible for you.

269
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,680
But...

270
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,480
the ancestors have shown their presence.

271
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,120
I have to establish a career first and get married.

272
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,000
So I can't

273
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,460
this responsibility.

274
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,240
I can't.

275
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
Why are you blushing?

276
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
What are you thinking about?

277
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,360
Who's thinking about something dirty?

278
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,970
Look at your blushing face.

279
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,960
You're still thinking about dirty things.

280
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,480
Bah!

281
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,400
I, Xu Ziqi, am a bad commander in Chang'an.

282
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,660
Why would I think about something dirty?

283
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,820
How old are you?

284
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm 22.

285
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,280
22 years old.

286
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,530
You're not married yet?

287
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
It's really rare.

288
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,400
You...

289
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
Get lost!

290
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,200
Now...

291
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,760
Forget it.

292
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,250
You can sleep on the cold chair.

293
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,000
This egg clear water is really good.

294
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,840
I'm poor now.

295
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,300
I have no one to rely on.

296
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,440
I don't know how to become

297
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,640
how to become

298
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,540
the best female merchant in Tang?

299
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Get up early to embrace the sun

300
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,200
Make life

301
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,200
full of positive energy.

302
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,360
Full of positive energy.

303
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Morning, Lord Xu.

304
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,980
I've prepared breakfast for you.

305
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
Let's eat first.

306
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,020
I'll take you to a place later.

307
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Sure.

308
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,120
Look at what you want

309
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,570
Eat something you want.

310
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Don't think about it when you leave.

311
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,040
You don't have a school.

312
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,520
You die fast if you walk around.

313
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
There is a place outside the city

314
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,200
for people like you.

315
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,240
Go and settle over there.

316
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
Why is there a Concubine Hu?

317
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Have you forgotten?

318
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,040
Today is the annual

319
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,640
the annual charity auction.

320
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,920
The auctioned prostitute, Gu Jin'er.

321
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,520
by Gu Jin'er.

322
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,960
Tonight, Pingkang Fang

323
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,420
in Pingkang Fang tonight.

324
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,040
Spending money.

325
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,960
Last year,

326
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,760
last year.

327
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,640
Spend money.

328
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,200
When you go out,

329
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,640
to go out.

330
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,280
But the place you're going

331
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,240
is free.

332
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,280
When you arrive,

333
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
just say my name.

334
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,600
But

335
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,300
I still have some money

336
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,760
I still have some money on me.

337
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,020
It's more convenient.

338
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,260
I have some money here.

339
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,480
Take it.

340
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,260
Are you chasing me away

341
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,360
I want you to go outside the city

342
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
outside the city.

343
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,840
Lord Xu.

344
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,770
I must stay in Chang'an.

345
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,090
What did you say?

347
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,520
Lord Xu.

348
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,160
Consider it a loan from me.

349
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll pay you back later.

350
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,960
Hua Xiao Zheng.

351
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,000
You...

352
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,160
Okay.

353
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,280
Okay.

354
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,200
Good.

355
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,360
Good.

356
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
All the brocade boxes today

357
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,640
were made by

358
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,960
by Jin'er.

359
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,960
The auction today

360
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,600
all the money

361
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,760
will be donated.

362
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Not a penny.

363
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,000
I hope you

364
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,360
to help us.

365
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,920
Let's welcome

366
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,240
Miss Jin'er.

367
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,640
Okay.

368
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,000
The delinquents in Chang'an

369
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,460
to maintain social order.

370
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,400
A delinquent.

371
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,280
A delinquent.

372
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Here comes Lord Xu.

373
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
Chairman of Anle Chamber of Commerce is here.

374
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,450
Lower the sedan.

375
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Mr. Bang.

376
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,480
Mr. Bang.

377
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Mr. Bang.

378
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
Mr. Fang.

379
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,120
You're still so charming.

380
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,770
It keeps rising every year.

381
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,280
Thank you, Lord Xu,

382
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,040
for protecting me.

383
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you, Mr. Bang.

384
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,280
For Jin'er's Jinbox auction,

385
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,880
for Jin'er's brocade auction.

386
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Mr. Xu.

387
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,640
Please take care of

388
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,760
Thank you.

389
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
I have prepared

390
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,880
for you two.

391
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,960
We can catch up with you.

392
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Please.

393
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,490
Let's go.

394
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
You go up first.

395
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,120
I'll be right back.

396
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
I'll wait for you.

397
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,620
I'll wait for you, Lord Xu.

398
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,040
This way, please.

399
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,220
Tu Da, Jia Ding.

400
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,200
Maintain order at the scene.

401
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,680
Yes.

402
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,640
This is

403
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,240
for today.

404
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,960
will be auctioned

405
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,840
will be auctioned for you.

406
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
The last one

407
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,880
will be given

408
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,440
will be given to

409
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
a garden in the suburbs.

410
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,720
there took in

411
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,520
over a hundred orphans.

412
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Jin'er also lost her family when she was young.

413
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,440
I don't want them

414
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,770
since they were little.

415
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,720
If you pity me,

416
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,680
I'll be grateful.

417
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,520
Good.

418
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,120
Okay.

419
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay.

420
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,960
500 taels.

421
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,040
800 taels

422
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,160
1,000 taels.

423
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,480
2,000 taels of gold.

424
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,840
2,000 taels.

425
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,000
2,000 taels

426
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,760
Any higher price?

427
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,520
2,000 taels.

428
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,680
I announce

429
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,200
the last box

430
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,480
was taken

431
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,160
and Mr. Bang.

432
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,280
Sure.

433
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,880
Okay.

434
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,500
Congratulations.

435
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,960
Come on.

436
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,200
Go up, Mr. Bang.

437
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,920
Here.

438
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Come on.

439
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,600
Okay.

440
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,280
Now

441
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,200
to enjoy our dance.

442
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,960
Please sit down.

443
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,820
We're going to spend money later.

444
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,240
Okay.

445
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,690
Let me fill it up for you.

446
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,520
The auction tonight

447
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,720
Good work, everyone.

448
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,440
Mr. Bang.

449
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
This year's money

450
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,450
is three times as much as last year.

451
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Mr. Bang is brilliant.

452
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,840
You came up with a blind photography box

453
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,480
to raise the money.

454
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,720
As usual.

455
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,200
40% of the Chamber of Commerce.

456
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,520
I'll send it to you

457
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,640
I'll send it to you.

458
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,640
Good job.

459
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,560
Coach Xue.

460
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Didn't you say this place

461
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,480
is specially prepared

462
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,880
for me and Lord Xu?

463
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,200
Yes.

464
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,920
Lord Xu is busy.

465
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,980
He hasn't come yet.

466
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,280
Please enjoy.

467
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,920
Mr. Xu, you are finally here.

468
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Chairman Fang

469
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,260
is waiting for you.

470
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,040
Li, it's been three years.

471
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,440
How are you?

472
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
I'm fine.

473
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,840
I am now the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

474
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,200
I heard that after you returned to Chang'an,

475
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
after you came back to Chang'an.

476
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,160
and survived.

477
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,520
From now on,

478
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,400
I'm going to get married

479
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
and live a peaceful life.

480
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,120
We'll protect each other from now on.

481
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,200
I will protect you.

482
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,240
It's indeed a prosperous world.

483
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,680
So lively.

484
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,840
The three biggest lanterns

485
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,520
Mr. Fang

486
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
will light the lantern for you.

487
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,280
Okay.

488
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,400
OK. OK.

489
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,040
Anle Chamber of Commerce

490
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,840
to pray for peace

491
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,680
I pray for peace and prosperity

492
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,960
and give back to the people.

493
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,020
Wish you good luck.

494
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,040
The money-sprinkling ceremony officially begins.

495
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,440
Okay.

496
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Hurry up.

497
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,160
The first light is on.

498
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,370
and have no worries.

499
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,920
The second light is on.

500
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,320
Blessings and longevity

501
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,960
Hua Xiaochi

502
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
How dare you come here?

503
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,840
The third light is on.

504
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
The sun is on

505
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,200
It's okay.

506
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,960
Move!

507
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,940
Hua Xiaochi, you pervert!

508
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,960
How dare you

509
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
How dare you

510
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,240
to Chairman Bang?

511
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,640
Mr. Bang.

512
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,000
I’m the chairman of Anle Chamber of Commerce.

513
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Fang Li.

514
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,480
Guards!

515
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,960
Arrest her!

516
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:18,960
Yes.

517
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,200
Don't you care about

518
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,140
what happened last night?

519
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
Last night...

520
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,880
What are you talking about?

521
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,440
Get him.

522
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,480
Are you angry?

523
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm not responsible for you.

524
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,880
Shut up!

525
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,760
Get him!

526
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,360
I didn't expect

527
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,520
you turned your back on me.

528
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,840
I...

529
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,600
How could I do such a thing?

530
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,720
No way.

531
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Really?

532
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,680
What are you waiting for?

533
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,280
Go get him.

534
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,960
Yes.

535
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,040
Move!

536
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,160
Shut up!

537
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,360
You picked up a lot of money.

538
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
You scared me.

539
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Xu Ziqi who was stabbed a thousand times

540
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,650
He knows the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce?

541
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,920
Oh no.

542
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
This is bad.

543
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,640
I've offended him.

544
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
How can he live in Chang'an?

545
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,740
If you want to establish a career and become the best female merchant in Tang,

546
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,520
I have to work hard.

547
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,880
connections.

548
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,840
[Store]

549
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,360
Price.

550
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,520
My capital.

551
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,200
My money!

552
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,400
You crazy girl.

553
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,440
I made you upset.

554
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,480
It's okay.

555
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,680
Nothing serious happened to me.

556
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,760
I'll drink with you tonight.

557
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:38,960
This kind of thing

558
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,240
never happen again.

559
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,920
Okay.

560
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,680
My money!

561
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,480
My money!

562
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,760
The money is gone.

563
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,120
It's all their fault.

564
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,850
I'd better stay away from them.

565
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,520
You

566
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,520
accompany Jin'er

567
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,400
to Lord Xu and Chairman Fang's room

568
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,660
and bring some fruits.

569
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,760
Okay.

570
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,760
Mr. Bang, Mr. Xu.

571
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,520
Okay.

572
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,200
Okay.

573
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Great.

574
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,960
Beautiful

575
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,640
So nice.

576
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,720
Husppy

577
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,720
Yes.

578
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,680
Go get more wine.

579
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,410
Yes, my lord.

580
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,200
Come on, Xu.

581
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,450
I can't take it anymore.

582
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,240
I need to rest.

583
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,690
Take a break.

584
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,440
I'll come in.

585
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,280
Mr. Bang.

586
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,720
I'm Jin'er.

587
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,420
I brought you some fruits.

588
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,200
Mr. Fang.

589
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,000
You scared me.

590
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,680
Mr. Bang.

591
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,840
Mr. Bang.

592
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,920
Mr. Bang.

593
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,520
Hurry.

594
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,600
Help me

595
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
back to my room.

596
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,920
This girl

597
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,960
is no ordinary person.

598
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,000
I want to see

599
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,139
what you want to do.

600
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,280
I've admired Mr. Fang for a long time.

601
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,880
This is the only chance I lack.

602
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,920
If I go with you today,

603
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,520
Jin'er.

604
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,080
Come here.

605
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
Come here.

606
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,920
Wake up, okay?

607
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,120
Mom.

608
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,000
If I sleep with him,

609
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,960
from now on,

610
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,160
you can only be responsible for me.

611
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,960
Why are you so confused?

612
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
Does he really like you?

613
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,400
You are...

614
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,840
You need

615
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,360
to force him

616
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,840
to force him to marry you?

617
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Stop looking.

618
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,810
Let's go.

619
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,840
Hurry up.

620
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,000
Let's go.

621
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,480
Hurry up. Stop looking.

622
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,600
Come on.

623
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,450
Hurry up.

624
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,440
Come out!

625
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,320
Stop looking. What are you looking at?

626
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,850
Let's go.

627
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,240
Let's go.

628
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,400
This woman is too...

629
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,400
Money is more reliable.

630
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,080
What is this?

631
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,480
It's so beautiful.

632
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,800
He's holding fireworks.

633
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,960
The standard of fireworks in the capital

634
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,760
Not bad.

635
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,400
Twin Dragons.

636
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,240
Alert!

637
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,640
Emergency muster!

638
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,160
Let's go.

639
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,450
Let's go.

640
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,040
Search everywhere.

641
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,480
Yes.

642
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,480
Boss.

643
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,120
Boss, wake up.

644
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,760
Boss.

645
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,500
Where's your signal bomb?

646
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,160
Search all rooms.

647
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,280
All suspects will be investigated.

648
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,920
Yes.

649
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
Guard patrol!

650
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,490
Irrelevant people, please leave.

651
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,960
The blanket is not covered.

652
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,290
What if you catch a cold?

653
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,240
All the delinquents cooperate with the Imperial Guards

654
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,000
to check all the people in Pingkang.

655
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,120
Check all rooms.

656
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,640
All suspicious people, check them. Yes, sir.

657
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,160
Yes.

658
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,800
Sir!

659
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,600
My Lord!

660
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,960
My Lord!

661
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,880
My Lord!

662
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,800
My Lord!

663
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,400
My Lord!

664
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,720
My Lord!

665
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,300
Where is he?

666
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,120
My lord, why are you here?

667
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,000
I didn't even cover my quilt.

668
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,440
What if you catch a cold?

669
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,400
Hey! Hey! Hey!

670
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,060
This...

671
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,100
This...

672
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,280
You witch!

673
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,040
How dare you

674
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,000
my lord's innocence.
