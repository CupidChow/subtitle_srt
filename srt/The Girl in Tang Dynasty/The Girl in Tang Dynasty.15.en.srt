1
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,840
Don't say anything. Let's go.

2
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,900
I'll take you away.

3
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
and leave Chang'an forever.

4
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,060
and leave this fearful place.

5
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,400
I also

6
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,360
leave the Chamber of Commerce forever.

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,730
Leave Chang'an?

8
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,860
Leave this place where you eat people without spitting bones.

9
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,079
But Ziqi,

10
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
I can't leave.

11
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
I worked so hard

12
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,560
to bear the humiliation and be a dog.

13
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
to

14
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,560
to bring

15
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,520
who was exiled.

16
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,520
and bring glory to our family.

17
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,840
But now,

18
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
there are rumors about you everywhere in Chang'an.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,240
The Chamber of Commerce won't let you go.

20
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,100
How about this?

21
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,860
If you really want to stay,

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,730
I'll help you lift the chamber.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,880
and shake the tree.

24
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,280
Fight a rock with an egg.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,730
You really don't want to leave?

26
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,960
It's just

27
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,960
be a dog who endures it.

28
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,360
It's just that in the past,

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,680
to the elders.

30
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,680
Now you can shake your tail to more people

31
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Shameless.

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,680
[Face]

33
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,210
and reputation.

34
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,440
When I restore my family,

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll get them all back.

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Okay.

37
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,420
If you decide not to leave,

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,530
I'll always be by your side.

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Ziqi.

40
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,260
How many times have I told you?

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,529
About the Chamber of Commerce,

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
as far as you can.

43
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,810
But you are in the Chamber of Commerce.

44
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,410
I'm afraid you'll get involved again.

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
you won't be in Chang'an.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Let me ask you.

47
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,920
If you want to be a dog,

48
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,159
Do you want Hua

49
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,600
be a dog with you?

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,600
I will protect her.

51
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,920
I'll do my best to protect her.

52
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,480
I will do

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,240
I will do it.

54
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,480
As long as you stop bullying Fang Li,

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,360
do you know

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,840
represents to the Chamber of Commerce?

57
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,240
A tool.

58
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,680
Tools. Tools.

59
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
You're a tool. You're a tool.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,280
You are the tool of the Chamber of Commerce.

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
and a tool to make money in the folk.

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,140
So what do you want me to do?

63
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,360
You misunderstood the Chamber of Commerce too much.

64
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,720
In fact, we want the people to live and work in peace.

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
The Tang has always regarded peony as a noble flower.

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,920
The price of acquiring peony is extremely high.

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,720
For the sake of the common people,

68
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,480
for the sake of the people.

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
As long as you plant peonies at home,

70
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
and stay at home,

71
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,800
the government will pay a lot of money to buy it.

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
will benefit the people.

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,480
That makes sense.

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,120
makes sense.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,400
Go and promote it.

76
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,000
and let everyone know the benefits of planting peonies.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,140
When the government acquired it with a lot of money,

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,800
you will be rewarded.

79
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,360
Benefit?

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,400
The Chamber of Commerce

81
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,680
the richest man in Tang.

82
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,000
The richest man of Tang?

83
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
Listen to the Chamber of Commerce.

84
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,040
Be a good Oiran.

85
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
Great! Great! Great!

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,659
The richest man! The richest man!

87
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Don't miss it.

88
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
A business opportunity to make a fortune Come quickly

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
Peony is a national flower.

90
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,720
Now the Chamber of Commerce is giving everyone

91
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,400
to make more money.

92
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,980
I've thought about it.

93
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,600
Peony is indeed

94
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,660
bought the peony the most every year.

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,480
with the highest price.

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,800
And the annual acquisition is very shocking.

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Don't miss this opportunity.

98
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,560
Please line up.

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,680
If you want to seize this business opportunity,

100
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,600
Get in line to buy seeds from me.

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Me too.

102
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Give me one.

103
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll buy two more.

104
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,720
Okay, thank you.

105
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Pay from the side.

106
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,159
Here you are.

107
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,800
Did you grow peonies?

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,530
Give me some.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,040
Take it.

110
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Don't mention it.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
I just got a dozen of flowers.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,240
Everyone in Chang'an is crazy.

113
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,800
This is yours.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,730
Yes. It's yours.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I got 30 flowers

116
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,400
to buy 30 flowers.

117
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
It costs me more money.

118
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,760
It's okay.

119
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,920
When the court receives flowers,

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
we'll earn more than we do now.

121
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,120
I think so.

122
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,580
We'll make a fortune then.

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes.

124
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,360
Are you okay with that?

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll take you there

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,040
after they all leave.

127
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,920
Okay.

128
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,820
Here you go.

129
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,360
Me too.

130
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
This is yours.

131
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,680
What?

132
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,700
Let me take you somewhere.

133
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,400
What are you doing? Put me down.

134
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
I kidnapped you to watch the sunset.

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
So beautiful.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,730
This is the first time I watch sunset in Chang'an.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,840
It's so beautiful. It's falling very fast.

138
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
Push

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,840
This is the innerhouse.

140
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,080
The people living here bought your peonies.

141
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,480
Ordinary people.

142
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,720
Let me show you their life.

143
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,480
and see where they live.

144
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,540
In the inner house.

145
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,380
People like them are everywhere.

146
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,180
a dozen people in a family.

147
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,420
The monthly income

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,530
is less than 50 copper cash.

149
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,320
But the peony plants in Chang'an

150
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,600
has been sold for over 20 copper cash.

151
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,840
Many families

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,360
are willing to bet on the acquisition

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,490
to bet on the acquisition of the peony.

154
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,480
Moreover,

155
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,220
who have no savings at home

156
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,600
You borrowed money from a loan shark.

157
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,330
Just because they believe you.

158
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,480
the peony

159
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,300
will definitely sell at a good price.

160
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,840
But I did look into the information.

161
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
The court does attach great importance to

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
the acquisition of peony.

163
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,610
That was in the past.

164
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,240
Now everyone in Chang'an is planting peonies.

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
The amount of peonies has increased

166
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,970
has increased by ten times.

167
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,720
It's rare.

168
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,720
These peonies might even be sold at a low price.

169
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,480
And planting peonies

170
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,880
to plant peonies.

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,720
Many people have no skills to plant flowers.

172
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,960
Peony plants many deaths.

173
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,820
What should the people do?

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
I didn't think that much.

175
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,290
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

176
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
I was careless.

177
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,840
You didn't contradict me. You didn't?

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,600
It seems

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,920
you did listen to me this time.

180
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,480
Do you know

181
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,340
I didn't make the decision

182
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,480
wasn't a decision I made.

183
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
Why did my ancestors die?

184
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,720
It's to keep the people alive.

185
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
I can't stand

186
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,600
let alone anyone bullying them.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,600
I don't want you to be the one.

188
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Xu Ziqi.

189
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,810
What should I do?

190
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
What should I tell the Chamber of Commerce?

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640
They are still bullying me.

192
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
I've found it out.

193
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
It's the Commerce. It's the Commerce of Commerce.

194
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
on purpose.

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
the court wants to buy peony at a high price.

196
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,840
I used you

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,480
I made a lot of money from the people.

198
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
I really thought

199
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,700
they would care about the people.

200
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,520
They think I'm a tool.

201
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,840
Right.

202
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,120
I still have the money for the plants.

203
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,920
I'll return it to the people now.

204
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,440
Xiao Zheng.

205
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,440
You can see the suffering of the people.

206
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Just do it.

207
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,600
and change.

208
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,960
and be

209
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,480
in your mind.

210
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
What did Xu Ziqi

211
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,960
by Xu Ziqi?

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,860
You have no idea

213
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,120
when you were the Oiran

214
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,890
you were really beautiful.

215
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
Work hard and modest.

216
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Thank you. Keep fighting for your dream.

217
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,720
Hua Xiaochi, come on!

218
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
Sell everything

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,840
and paid back all the money.

220
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
Are you out of your mind?

221
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,600
You spread the news

222
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,530
about the acquisition of peonies.

223
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,320
You cheated the people.

224
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,240
Do you have a conscience?

225
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,360
Zheng.

226
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
Master Yi, please calm down.

227
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Please calm down.

228
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Please calm down.

229
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,480
I’m disappointed in you.

230
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,140
You should kneel here.

231
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,600
As for this farmhouse slave, get lost!

232
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,320
Zheng!

233
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,760
Let's go together.

234
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,720
Stop kneeling. Let's go.

235
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Let's go.

236
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
Take him away

237
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
Leave me alone. Let's go.

238
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,120
Run! Run!

239
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Go!

240
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Separate hatred.

241
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,600
Miss Xiao.

242
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,440
Hang in there.

243
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,600
Who hit you?

244
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,400
It's Lord Xu. It's him. It's him.

245
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,640
Who hit him?

246
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Who else could it be?

247
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,200
Master Yi. He beat him so hard.

248
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,440
Where is Li?

249
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
He's still making her kneel.

250
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,960
Yes.

251
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,080
The four Elders are furious.

252
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
Judging from the situation,

253
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm afraid he'll kneel for one night.

254
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,840
Steward Yang, go to the Chamber of Commerce to investigate.

255
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,320
I'll figure something out.

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,960
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

257
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,720
I'll go now.

258
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,600
Please take good care of her.

259
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,480
It hurts. Be gentle.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,480
Master Yi is a martial artist, right?

261
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,240
He's so strong.

262
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,120
Look.

263
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,000
They are all steamed buns.

264
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,240
Why did you hit me so hard?

265
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,040
Your face is swollen.

266
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,360
How can you eat?

267
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,740
How about this?

268
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,760
I'll make some porridge for you tomorrow.

269
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Add some rough rice with chicken porridge.

270
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,690
It tastes better

271
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
I want some mushrooms

272
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
It's crushed.

273
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Hua Xiaochi, what are you doing?

274
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,440
Why are you drooling?

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
Well...

276
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,480
That Elder Ii

277
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,960
is a devil.

278
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,760
I'll remember her.

279
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,600
Just wait.

280
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,700
I'll teach her a lesson tomorrow.

281
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,850
How dare you bully my brother and hit my woman!

282
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,240
We're brothers too.

283
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,240
Yes.

284
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,440
You bullied my two brothers.

285
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,880
Well,

286
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,320
I'll return the money today.

287
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
Did I do well?

288
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
Nice, heroine.

289
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,360
That's for sure.

290
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,840
Who am I?

291
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,000
Stop talking.

292
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,360
You'll drool again.

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,730
Spread these information out.

294
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,370
and evacuate immediately.

295
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,440
Don't let anyone see us.

296
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,320
Oh no.

297
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,080
The master of the Chamber of Commerce

298
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,320
has an affair with a royal relative?

299
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,360
You have an affair?

300
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,600
As men,

301
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,480
didn’t become the leader of the four Elders.

302
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,160
but a little girl became the leader.

303
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,760
Today,

304
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,480
I finally understand

305
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
I have something urgent to tell you.

306
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,250
Get out if you want to make sarcastic remarks.

307
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,079
I admire you for that.

308
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
When Mount Tai collapses,

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,720
You still look the same.

310
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
You look so awkward.

311
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,770
but you're still giving us a hard time.

312
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm a woman.

313
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,050
As the leader of the elders,

314
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,880
he's capable and capable.

315
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,480
All these years,

316
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,200
all these years,

317
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,160
I would have died a long time ago.

318
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
I've given you face

319
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,080
I've given you enough respect.

320
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,520
In this situation,

321
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,560
I'm just a little girl.

322
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
You have to admit defeat.

323
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,160
No matter what.

324
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,800
At least I have filled up

325
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,160
for all these years.

326
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,100
It's your turn.

327
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,280
Can you do it?

328
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
I'll find out sooner or later

329
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
sooner or later.

330
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
who did it.

331
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,240
I didn’t do

332
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,400
did this.

333
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,080
It has nothing to do with me.

334
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,400
I didn't do it.

335
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,720
They're all on the same rope.

336
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,080
with sharp knives hanging on their heads.

337
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,440
Let me make it clear today.

338
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,530
If something happens to me,

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,040
I'll give you the ledger.

340
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
By then,

341
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,680
no one can live.

342
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,520
Have some tea.

343
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,480
We are friends.

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,800
Calm down.

345
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,320
Xiao Zheng.

346
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,800
You can’t find Elder Yi now.

347
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,680
This has spread throughout Chang'an.

348
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,280
Master Yi must be angry.

349
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,240
She used to be arrogant

350
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,480
to order us around.

351
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,520
She's now at the bottom of the valley.

352
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,640
We need to negotiate with her now.

353
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Separate hatred.

354
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,040
All the four Elders are farting.

355
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,860
Other than your position,

356
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,800
they're still doing

357
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
something shameful.

358
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,740
You are much better than them.

359
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,600
Everyone in Chang'an knows that

360
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,040
I'm just their puppet.

361
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
But everyone in Chang'an likes you.

362
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,960
Of course.

363
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,580
They probably like your appearance.

364
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
We know you.

365
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,480
In my heart, no matter who you are,

366
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,040
you're great.

367
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,780
I just want to bring my mother back

368
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,000
and bring glory to our family.

369
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,520
You have to believe that

370
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,780
you can bring them back with your talent.

371
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,520
We will always be with you.

372
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,720
You should've told me earlier.

373
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,000
I always feel

374
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,000
I was alone.

375
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,520
But since I met you,

376
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,520
after I met you,

377
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,480
I finally feel I have a soul.

378
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,040
Thank you.

379
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,280
It's okay. Those bad guys.

380
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
I'll try my best to fight for you.

381
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,240
I...

382
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,720
I'm so happy.

383
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,880
From now on,

384
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,960
you don't have to be alone in this world.

385
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,000
A hundred years later,

386
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
you have someone by your side.

387
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080
I’m relieved.

388
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,160
Yang Lin.

389
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,880
I can’t let a woman

390
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,410
into the tiger's den for me.

391
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
I have to show the Chamber of Commerce

392
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm on the same side with Xiao Zheng.

393
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,880
My lord.

394
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,760
What do you want to do?

395
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,280
Propose?

396
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,140
What you said last time...

397
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,720
Elder.

398
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,680
Who let you in?

399
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,920
Search carefully.

400
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,440
Yes.

401
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,000
Lord Xu.

402
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,000
It seems that you have been

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,080
for a long time.

404
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,040
Thank you.

405
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,200
We delinquents

406
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
We should do our best.

407
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,480
Mr. Xu is in a bad mood today.

408
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Aren't you afraid that the road will be hard?

409
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,280
Is my road hard?

410
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,320
depends on

411
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,720
my arrangement with God.

412
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,640
Let’s see

413
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,560
can get through this.

414
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,760
Boss, we found nothing.

415
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,000
No.

416
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,440
Let's go.

417
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,280
Lord Xu barged into the mansion today.

418
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,080
to barge into the mansion today?

419
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,640
We both know

420
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
why I came to the Chamber of Commerce today.

421
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,960
It’s my duty to search.

422
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,640
If I can't find it today,

423
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,520
it doesn't mean I can't find it in the future.

424
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,720
Looks like Lord Xu is well prepared.

425
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,200
You deserve

426
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,800
You'll be the king. You'll be the king.

427
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,660
The king of hell

428
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,760
He only accepts evil spirits in the mortal world.

429
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,720
This is a warning. Let's go.

430
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,640
King of Hell.

431
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,800
Did he know about the ledger?

432
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,240
I'm afraid it's leaked.

433
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,880
Xu Ziqi is hard to deal with.

434
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,200
We need to find Lord Wu to solve this.

435
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,730
The sooner, the better.

436
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,720
Why are you here?

437
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,730
You go first.

438
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,440
Yes.

439
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm here to avenge you and Bang.

440
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm here to seek revenge for myself.

441
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,240
That's good.

442
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,650
It looks more powerful.

443
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,520
Go. I'll protect you.

444
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,850
She dares not bully you.

445
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,080
Elder Yi, I want to talk to you alone.

446
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Lord Xu,

447
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,930
Please come with us.

448
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,720
Go ahead.

449
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,640
Your scandal has become like this.

450
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,160
I don't think people are interested.

451
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
Let's work together.

452
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,760
As long as you stop forcing me

453
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,480
and do what we don't want to do,

454
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,560
I have a way to help you regain the people's support

455
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,920
and make the people believe you again.

456
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,080
What do you want to do?

457
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
Do something practical.

458
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,480
What the people really need

459
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,240
like a shelter,

460
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,720
and sell them at a low price.

461
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,240
We can also make some cheap cosmetics

462
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,010
and benefit the people.

463
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,960
Then the people will support us.

464
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,720
I really don't understand.

465
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,560
How could a woman like you

466
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,880
Why would he like a stupid woman like you?

467
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,410
What do you mean?

468
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,560
Do you think I became the leader of the four Elders

469
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,800
for the people?

470
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,480
The Chamber of Commerce is doing a big business.

471
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,240
You spent a year

472
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,500
for the common people.

473
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
is not as good as

474
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,440
than mine.

475
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Why should I work so hard

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,260
for those poor people?

477
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,920
So you don't care about your reputation.

478
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,320
or worry about

479
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,560
Everyone in Chang'an is scolding you.

480
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,560
Do you think I still care about my privacy

481
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,980
I still care about my privacy being exposed?

482
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,480
Even if everyone in Chang'an scolds me,

483
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
So what?

484
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,000
Can they defeat me

485
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,480
or the people behind me?

486
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,560
Do they dare to scold me?

487
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
Just like you.

488
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,490
you only dare to negotiate with me.

489
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,520
If I don't agree,

490
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,560
you'll still be helpless.

491
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,280
This is the reason

492
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,960
Human for fish.

493
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,240
You're bullying me because you're rich and powerful.

494
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,680
I am.

495
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,720
I have no one to rely on.

496
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
I started from scratch in Chang'an.

497
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,720
I earned all my power

498
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,560
by myself.

499
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,160
Now that I have power, I use it.

500
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,640
I'll make it clear today.

501
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,480
Do you think I'm bullying you?

502
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,720
I hate him for being invincible.

503
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,240
It's not my fault

504
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,560
It's not my fault.

505
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,880
It's not his fault either.

506
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,760
It's you.

507
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,200
You don't understand

508
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,000
what separation is.

509
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,480
What are the rules of this world?

510
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,160
People like you

511
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,200
don't deserve to live in Chang'an.

512
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,160
I don't understand.

513
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,960
A person like you who doesn't care about human life

514
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,260
deserve to be an elder?

515
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,480
You...

516
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,920
You barbarian!

517
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
Get out!

518
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
It's not me.

519
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,760
I'll fire you.

520
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,160
I quit.

521
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,020
My legs are dirty if I step into the Chamber of Commerce.

522
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,760
Bye.

523
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Why don't you chop off your legs too?

524
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,240
I was just finding an excuse to throw you.

525
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,200
Stupid woman!

526
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
You're a barbarian! You're the best! You're the best!

527
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,080
You finally became the Oiran.

528
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,480
and ended up with these evil merchants.

529
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,400
Forget it. I might as well set up my own brand

530
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,560
and the Chamber of Commerce.

531
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,760
I'll do R&D.

532
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm here to support you.

533
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,040
I don't believe I can't figure it out.

534
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
I don't want to live a pathetic life.

535
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,880
I want to be the master of my life.

536
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,080
I have to go and get a divorce.

537
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,480
That's awesome.

538
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,320
You've become more reckless lately.

539
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,680
I asked you to arrange Hua Xiaochi

540
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,240
but you acted on your own to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

541
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,880
You alerted the enemy.

542
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,880
You even got yourself injured.

543
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,420
Your Highness.

544
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,200
Lord Xu took the punishment himself.

545
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
He did it himself.

546
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,200
by himself.

547
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,920
I've been investigating the Chamber of Commerce for more than three months.

548
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,880
The Chamber of Commerce is extremely cautious.

549
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
Instead of waiting,

550
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,320
we should lure the snake out.

551
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,560
I will

552
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,040
will make you worry.

553
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,580
and start to transfer the ledger.

554
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,820
Release hatred

555
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
[Falling in love]

556
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,280
He's here. He's here.

557
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,780
Where is your lord?

558
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,400
I don't know.

559
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,540
As soon as you left,

560
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,760
The Lord went out with Butler Yang

561
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,090
and never came back.

562
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,480
Oh no, was I too arrogant?

563
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,240
The Chamber of Commerce took away the Separation Greed.

564
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,400
I can't defeat the Chamber of Commerce alone.

565
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,720
No, I have to find Xu Ziqi.

566
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,560
It sounds like

567
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,480
you planned all this.

568
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,250
Then why did you take the initiative to take the punishment?

569
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,240
Because I like Hua Xiaochi.

570
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,010
The Chamber of Commerce

571
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,930
of the Chamber of Commerce.

572
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,000
I should handle it myself.

573
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,640
She is the one I love.

574
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,320
So,

575
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,480
I can't let her take the risk.

576
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,280
What retirement?

577
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I don't want

578
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,520
I don't want them all.

579
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,080
I will never leave Chang'an.

580
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,050
I won't leave the court.

581
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,480
Xu Ziqi.

582
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
You took Hua Xiaochi out of the city that day

583
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,400
and left me a letter of self-condemnation.

584
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,760
I knew

585
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,680
you love this woman deeply.

586
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,280
Fine.

587
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,680
The Xu family is loyal to Tang.

588
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,240
Don't worry.

589
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,060
I won't let you die.

590
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,480
let you die.

591
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,040
and kill your Xu family.

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

593
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,280
Xu Ziqi

594
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,040
Xu Ziqi. Xu Ziqi.

595
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,880
Xu Ziqi.

596
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,400
Jia Ding, have you seen Lord Xu?

597
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,500
Are you also looking for Chief Xu?

598
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,160
What happened to Xu Ziqi?

599
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,960
After searching the elder’s home,

600
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,240
Master Xu disappeared.

601
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,800
We've been looking for him for almost two hours.

602
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,880
There's no news.

603
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,280
Keep looking.

604
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,560
At this point,

605
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,340
I want you to make up for your mistake.

606
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
and fight against the four elders.

607
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,280
and force them to attack you.

608
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,450
Then you can pretend to die.

609
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,280
Only if you die,

610
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
if you die.

611
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,020
the court will be fine.

612
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,080
By investigating your cause of death,

613
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,160
the cause of your death

614
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,040
to make the four elders suspect each other.

615
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,880
They will think

616
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,720
they sent someone to harm you.

617
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,800
The more they bite,

618
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,960
the better it is for us.

619
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,480
Understood? Yes, Your Majesty.

620
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,380
Brilliant, Your Majesty.

621
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,560
These two living people...

622
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,880
Where have they been all day?

623
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
Where did they go?

624
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,560
Did I see a ghost or did they see a ghost?

625
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,860
Hua Xiao Zheng!

626
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,320
Ancestor

627
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,760
A sudden breeze

628
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,240
I feel like I'm only seeing you for the last time.

629
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,400
I have to tell you.

630
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,440
the last hint of your future husband.

631
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,720
The last hint.

632
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,280
From now on,

633
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,280
go to Feng Hua Pavilion under the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda

634
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,040
the first man you met.

635
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,080
is your future husband.

636
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,240
the first man you met.

637
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,720
This is...

638
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,000
Feng Hua Pavilion

639
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,880
What are they doing?

640
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,960
Yes, it's quite festive.

641
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,010
Boss Xu, why don't you go in and have a seat?

642
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,920
Let's go.

643
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,960
Butler Husppy

644
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,280
Why are you here?

645
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Miss Li.

646
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,480
Come on, open this flower for you.

647
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
For me?

648
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,920
It's really a piece of cake.

649
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,880
What is this?

650
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,880
I don't want to play anymore.

651
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,400
Wait.

652
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,480
Here we go. Here we go.

653
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Let me bloom

654
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,920
Xiao Zheng.

655
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
I want to be

656
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,920
in your life.

657
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,560
Why didn't you do that

658
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,320
make a flower?

659
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,840
Because you like flowers

660
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,320
Be serious.

661
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,920
My lord is confessing to you.

662
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,480
Xiao Zheng.

663
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,060
This is the hairpin my mother left me.

664
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,679
It's her last personal item.

665
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,360
Xiao Zheng.

666
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,840
My mother told me

667
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,920
this hairpin

668
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,449
can only be given to my future wife.

669
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,679
We've only known each other

670
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,199
until now.

671
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Walk side by side

672
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,880
You comfort me

673
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,620
and encouraged me,

674
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,199
support me, cherish me,

675
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
and love me.

676
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
My love and hatred

677
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,199
In this life,

678
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,400
to have you by my side.

679
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,679
Zheng.

680
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,199
Marry me.

681
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,480
I will use all my power

682
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,010
to give you a peaceful life.

683
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,200
and happiness.

684
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,400
Well, I...

685
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Ms. Zheng,

686
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,760
I used to hate you.

687
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,200
But now I see you

688
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,080
you finally have a smile.

689
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,520
No matter what I do,

690
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,480
I'm not alone anymore.

691
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,180
Most importantly,

692
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,480
as a woman,

693
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,500
you care so much about him.

694
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,130
and take care of him.

695
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,890
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

696
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
Thank you for protecting me.

697
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,040
Thank you for arguing with the Chamber of Commerce.

698
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,480
From now on,

699
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,600
I won't let you

700
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
alone again.

701
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,480
Xu Ziqi.

702
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,840
Yes, I've been looking for him all day.

703
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,320
Do you know where Xu Ziqi is?

704
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,960
What?

705
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,520
Xiao Zheng, I'm proposing to you.

706
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,240
You...

707
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
I'm here.

708
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,040
Here, Lord Xu is here.

709
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
Xu Ziqi

710
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,360
Sir.

711
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,920
Zheng.

712
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,720
What's wrong?

713
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,680
Ziqi

714
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,140
My lord.

715
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,960
Zheng!

716
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,960
Zheng!

717
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,480
Xu Ziqi.

718
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,340
Why is your head

719
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
Why is it swollen?

720
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,200
Xu Ziqi.

721
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
Are you going to die?

722
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
Yang Lin, call the doctor.

723
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,000
My lord.

724
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,810
Are you proposing to me?

725
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,320
It's not appropriate.

726
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,040
Xu Ziqi.

727
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,480
Ziqi

728
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,680
Ziqi

729
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,680
Call the doctor.

730
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,560
Have some tea, my lord.

731
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,880
Lord Xu

732
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,320
I think he did it on purpose.

733
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,640
Chang'an is such a big place.

734
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,480
What's wrong with him fainting?

735
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,080
He insisted on fainting in Hua Xiaochi's arms.

736
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,120
Yae.

737
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
How is Lord Xu?

738
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,960
I was tapping Mr. Meng in the country.

739
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,420
he was seriously injured.

740
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Did Hua Xiao Zheng agree to propose?

741
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,640
Jin'er!

742
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,120
Jin'er! Jin'er!

743
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,680
Chairman Fang has already...

744
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,520
He's asking for his hand. He's asking for his hand. He's asking for his hand. He's here.

745
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes.

746
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,840
Zheng must have

747
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,760
agreed.

748
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,640
Why are you

749
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,560
to pursue?

750
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,440
No.

751
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
You didn't agree.

752
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,560
Of course I did.

753
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,940
I want to see Mr. Xu.

754
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,920
Where are Lord Xu and Xiao Zheng?

755
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,280
Yes.

756
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
Where's Hua Xiaochi?

757
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,000
Be gentle.

758
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,700
Why are you poking?

759
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,000
Didn't you ask me to check your wound?

760
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,840
I told you to be gentle.

761
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,700
How do I know if I don't count them?

762
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,920
Fine.

763
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,840
Stop poking.

764
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,970
Aren't you capable?

765
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,680
to hurt yourself?

766
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,340
What's wrong with poking you?

767
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,120
It hurts.

768
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,440
Xu Ziqi.

769
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,280
I'll get mad.

770
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,560
Xu Ziqi, I'm putting medicine on you.

771
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,040
Miss Hua is so cruel.

772
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,940
Lord Xu is covered with wounds and yet he still wants to poison him.

773
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,280
Lord Xu, take a rest.

774
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,160
Bite later.

775
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,760
Judging from your teeth,

776
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,000
he should be fine.

777
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm fine.

778
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,520
It's just a minor injury.

779
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,050
It should heal in a few days.

780
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,580
But you still need to apply the medicine.

781
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,440
Will you marry Mr. Fang?

782
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm asking you.

783
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,000
Do you agree?

784
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,880
Lord Xu is badly injured.

785
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,360
Let's talk about this later.

786
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,680
Lord Xu just said

787
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,040
it's just a scratch.

788
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,080
Answer me now.

789
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,080
He's just comforting us.

790
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,360
Right, Lord Xu?

791
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,680
Lord Xu.

792
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,760
Xu...

793
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,680
Xu Ziqi.

794
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,280
Why are you awake?

795
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,000
In an emergency,

796
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
I gave Lord Xu a pulse.

797
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,600
If the acupuncture point goes down,

798
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,000
unless it's a dead person,

799
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,280
they will react.

800
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,960
Then

801
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,000
will you faint again?

802
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,920
Lord Xu, are you sure you're okay?

803
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,960
Don't worry.

804
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,280
Lord Xu won't faint again.

805
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,700
Unless he dies.

806
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,080
Hua Xiaochi, answer me first.

807
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,040
Let go of me!

808
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,680
Wait, answer me.

809
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,080
Answer me.

810
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,000
Will you agree to Mr. Fang's proposal?

811
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,530
Alright.

812
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
Get down! Assassins!

813
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,160
Where?

814
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,120
Zheng.

815
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,500
Jin'er!

816
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,640
Help! Help!

817
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,480
Brother, help!

818
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,400
Protect me!

819
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,280
Oops! Oops!

820
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,840
Boss!

821
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,320
Get a doctor.

822
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,120
Did you forget to touch the carp?

823
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,560
Something happened.

824
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
Hurry, protect them.

825
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,280
Hurry up. Let's go.

826
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,360
Let's go.

827
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,340
Xiao Zheng.

828
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,160
Hurry!

829
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,960
Don't pull me.

830
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,860
Xiao Zheng!

831
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,480
Catch the assassin!

832
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,680
I...

833
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,000
Am I not human?

834
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,180
There's no one.

835
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,520
to protect me?

836
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,440
Is this

837
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,640
feeling lonely?

838
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,440
Ms. Yang, why are you lying down?

839
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,600
You are our guide

840
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,320
Stop howling.

841
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,640
Why don't you pick a good day

842
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,320
Why didn't you pick a good day?

843
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,160
If I don't stop the bleeding,

844
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,080
if I don't stop the bleeding.

845
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,530
Where's the doctor?

846
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,440
Yae!

847
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,360
Doctor!

848
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,940
Coming.

849
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,200
Hurry up.

850
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,480
Bite it.

851
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,120
Hang in there.

852
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,600
It'll be over soon.

853
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,480
Miss Yang, you've lost too much blood.

854
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,040
You need a strong prescription.

855
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,120
You must use the blood of your closest relative as the guiding.

856
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,680
Use mine.

857
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,400
No.

858
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:00,920
Use mine.

859
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,560
No!

860
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,800
Yae is fine.

861
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,480
Listen to me.

862
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,080
No, no.

863
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
No.

864
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,040
No.

865
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,000
Xu Ziqi.

866
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,600
Are you going to die?

867
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,480
Don't laugh. You don't know how worried I was.

868
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,000
You're badly injured.

869
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,860
What if something happens to you?

870
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,600
You were so worried about me.

871
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,960
I just found out today.

872
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,280
Your job is easy to get hurt.

873
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,680
Why don't you quit?

874
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,560
Fine, I quit.

875
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,200
I won't do it again, okay?

876
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,280
Stop crying.

877
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,880
You're crying like I'm dead.

878
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,080
I'm holding myself back. I'm not crying.

879
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,660
What are you doing?

880
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,440
Do you really want Jin'er to confess her love?

881
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,520
Stop her!

882
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,560
I do love Jin'er.

883
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,200
But the more I do this,

884
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,100
the more I can't let her do what she doesn't like.

885
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,800
Hero, I'm annoyed.

886
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,200
Mr. Bang has been

887
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,320
for three years.

888
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,760
I think

889
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,120
it's time to talk to you.

890
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,200
I used to be a lowly servant.

891
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,360
Now I can make my own decision

892
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,520
and live the life I want.

893
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,160
I...

894
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,600
I've admired you for a long time.

895
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,880
I want to

896
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,520
I wish you happiness

897
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
I'm still waiting for you.

898
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,280
Jin'er.

899
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,610
My heart has already begun.

900
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,520
I won't change

901
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,930
Thank you for your love.

902
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,680
I hope you can find a good man soon.

903
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,080
I'm fine.

904
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,800
Don't be sad.

905
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,440
Jin'er.

906
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,120
As long as you're willing,

907
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,960
I will

908
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,320
to marry you.

909
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,080
Hero, I'm upset.

910
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,560
I'm so upset.

911
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,680
Good brother.

912
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,400
Good brothers.

913
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,960
Good brother.

914
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,800
Shameless!

915
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,480
Watch out for a big knife.

916
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,680
will kill you.

917
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,600
Then why didn't you do it?

918
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,440
I was forced.

919
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,560
Look.

920
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,600
Shameless!

921
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,320
He grabbed it tightly.

922
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,880
Zheng.

923
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,040
It's inconvenient for a man and a woman

924
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,480
It's really inconvenient.

925
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
I'd better

926
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,060
another room for Ziqi.

927
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,120
No need, Li.

928
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,640
Well...

929
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,360
How's Ms. Yang's injury?

930
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,960
The doctor said he's fine.

931
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,680
I'm here to see if you're scared.

932
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,580
Xiao Zheng.

933
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,920
I only have you in my heart.

934
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,640
But...

935
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,810
You haven't responded yet.

936
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,160
Well...

937
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,800
I...

938
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,480
Bad news!

939
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,800
Yang Debiao is not Steward Yang's daughter
