1
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,000
They say the best male dancer in Chang'an

2
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
is you.

3
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,000
Speak.

4
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880
Say something, Xu Ziqi.

5
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,280
Just say it.

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,520
Xu Ziqi.

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,600
Who is the best male dancer in Chang'an?

8
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,000
The best male dancer in Chang'an is...

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,360
It's Master Fang Lihen and Master Yingxiong.

10
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,240
You seem to know quite a lot.

11
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,200
Everyone in Chang'an knows about the two dancing masters.

12
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Isn't that right, everyone?

13
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,840
Yes.

14
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,180
They dance beautifully. I've seen them.

15
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,960
I... I...

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,640
Master Ying.

17
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,680
Please look. Look carefully.

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,800
Master Ying, let me see your tongue.

19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,240
Brother, I really have something urgent.

20
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,140
Lin.

21
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,760
This is...

22
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
...way too targeted!

23
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,040
Brother, I won't go in.

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,860
Just deliver a message for me.

25
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Brother, please help me out.

26
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,880
Young Master Ying's gynophobia

27
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,760
has improved remarkably.

28
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
At this rate,

29
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Young Master Ying and Miss Jin'er

30
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,320
can continue participating in the courtesan competition

31
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
without any problem.

32
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,250
Yes, indeed.

33
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,720
What is it?

34
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,520
Sir,

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,080
Hua Xiaofei is right now at the entrance of Pingkang Ward

36
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,880
asking specifically to see you.

37
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,090
Stay calm, quickly!

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
Start meditating

39
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,079
and activate your chakras.

40
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Inhale.

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Exhale.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,079
Inhale.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,760
Exhale.

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,880
Tell yourself

45
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,880
Hua Xiaofei is just a passing cloud.

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,000
A passing cloud.

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Heroic Young Master,

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Hua Xiaofei invites you to dance with her

49
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
for the first round of the courtesan competition.

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
Flying wing to wing,

51
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
a toast to destiny!

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
Inhale.

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,520
Exhale.

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,080
Heroic Young Master,

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,380
Hua Xiaofei invites you to dance with her

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,000
for the first round of the courtesan competition.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,130
Flying wing to wing,

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
a toast to destiny!

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
Heroic Young Master,

60
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,000
Hua Xiaofei invites you to dance with her

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
for the first round of the courtesan competition.

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,760
Flying wing to wing,

63
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
a toast to destiny!

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
Stay calm, sir!

65
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Hua Xiaofei invites you to dance with her

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,360
for the first round of the courtesan competition.

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,220
Stop shouting!

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,620
Can't you let people have some peace?

69
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Yingzi, go out and drive that troublemaker away.

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,680
Yes.

71
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
Stay calm, sir.

72
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,940
Young Master Ying.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,860
Young Master Ying.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,120
Hero.

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,680
Young Master Ying.

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,000
Hero.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Young Master.

78
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,320
Ali.

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,620
Have you heard?

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,000
One of Chang'an's Twin Pillars, Hero

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,930
is already dead.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,400
You're the only one left.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
It can't be that soon.

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Fang Lihen.

85
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
Fang Lihen.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,640
Erha.

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Fang Lihen.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,080
Don't move. I see you.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
If you have any issues, come at me

90
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,250
and leave Ali alone.

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,880
You...

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,860
Fang Lihen.

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,560
I need you.

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,440
You need...

95
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm begging you.

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
One of Chang'an's Twin Pillars is already gone.

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,200
You're all I have left.

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,760
Isn't Hero in this state because of you?

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,220
Whatever you want, come at me.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,660
President,

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,440
why won't you dance with me?

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
It's improper,

103
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,690
absolutely not.

104
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,440
You...

105
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,080
If you don't agree,

106
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,760
I...

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll hold onto your leg and won't let go.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,320
Miss Xiaofei.

109
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,240
What are you doing?

110
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
Miss Xiaofei.

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,930
Get up, Erha.

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,360
Ali.

113
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Get up.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Miss Xiaofei.

115
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,570
President Fang.

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
President Fang.

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
President Fang.

118
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,120
Miss Xiaofei.

119
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Stop right there.

120
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,800
Fang Lihen.

121
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,220
President.

122
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
If you don't agree today,

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
I'll come find you every day.

124
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,680
You'll see me as soon as you open your eyes

125
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
and hear my voice even when you close them.

126
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
You must agree to my request.

127
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
Look how determined she is.

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,500
Why not just agree?

129
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,800
No.

130
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,620
Anything else is fine,

131
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
but this courtesan matter

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,930
is absolutely out of the question.

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,120
Why not?

134
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Hua Xiaofei.

135
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
Your daily playfulness,

136
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,640
I can take as a young woman's sentiment

137
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,440
just for fun.

138
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
But life needs planning.

139
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,210
Every step must be correct.

140
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,240
One wrong step leads to many more.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,170
What status does a courtesan have?

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,880
Even if they can enter high society,

143
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,120
they'll still be looked down upon by people of power.

144
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
A woman

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,880
whose background isn't prestigious

146
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,810
should just find someone to marry.

147
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,880
Don't waste your life.

148
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,200
I'm just choosing to be a courtesan.

149
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,800
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

150
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,200
Wasting my life?

151
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,180
Why do you make being a courtesan sound so terrible?

152
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,180
If being a courtesan is so bad,

153
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,170
how is Gu Jin'er doing so well at it?

154
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,420
You even support her publicly

155
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,800
and attend so many events with her.

156
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,080
Gu Jin'er's situation is different.

157
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,960
She was unfortunate enough to be sold to Pingkang District

158
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,220
and is destined to remain there for life.

159
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,080
People are born into different social classes

160
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,010
and some things cannot be changed.

161
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,580
Becoming a courtesan is her best option.

162
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
But you, Hua Xiaofei,

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,179
are different.

164
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,090
Gu Jin'er is deeply in love with you

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,860
but tries to kill me whenever she sees me.

166
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
You're actually using her as a pawn.

167
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,280
Both of you keep rejecting Miss Xiaofei

168
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,960
without explaining what's really going on.

169
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,220
It's driving me crazy!

170
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,320
Here's the situation:

171
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,040
Originally,

172
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,840
Young Master Yingxiong was supposed to compete with Miss Jin'er.

173
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,800
And our master

174
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,040
is one of the judges.

175
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,040
But you made Young Master Yingxiong unconscious.

176
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,200
And now,

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
just moments ago,

178
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,890
our master received orders from the guild

179
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,480
to replace Young Master Yingxiong and compete alongside Miss Jin'er,

180
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
and they must win.

181
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,840
Do you understand now?

182
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,680
Get it?

183
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,130
Stay out of it. Keep your distance.

184
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,400
Ziqi!

185
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,680
Ziqi!

186
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
You should help me with this favor.

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,800
You must persuade Hua Xiaofei

188
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,680
not to enter the Flower Queen competition.

189
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,160
If she really participates,

190
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
people will gossip about her for life.

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,890
Her reputation will be ruined.

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
What's so bad about her reputation?

193
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,920
The Flower Queen title is officially recognized by the court.

194
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,680
No, that's not...

195
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Alright, don't worry.

196
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,610
Please sit down.

197
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,440
A woman

198
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,940
who isn't some trafficked lowly servant

199
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,880
yet eagerly seeks to expose herself in public.

200
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
That Gu Jin'er's skills in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting,

201
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,560
poetry and prose

202
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,960
are indeed quite accomplished among the women in Chang'an.

203
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
But Elder Yi still looks down on her,

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
thinking her origins too humble.

205
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,560
What exactly is Elder Yi's background?

206
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,760
Why do you look down on people like that?

207
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,320
Actually, she comes from nobility too,

208
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
just like me, we share the same misfortune.

209
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,840
Her father was a third-rank official in the court.

210
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,560
For extorting the common people,

211
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
he was imprisoned

212
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,720
and his family suffered for it.

213
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,440
There's something I've been wondering about.

214
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,640
Why among the four elders of this guild,

215
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,960
is this Elder Yi specifically

216
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,920
the head of the four elders?

217
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,680
Is it because of her good looks?

218
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,080
Don't underestimate Elder Yi.

219
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,010
She comes from nobility after all.

220
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,880
She's well-educated

221
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
and talented.

222
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,200
All the guild's affairs

223
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,740
and account books are managed by her.

224
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm so clumsy.

225
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,220
Are you all right, sir?

226
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,250
Steward Yang...

227
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,520
We're just having a casual chat.

228
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,440
Your technique for spilling tea is so awkward.

229
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
If you'd splashed just a little,

230
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
it might have seemed natural.

231
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,410
But you poured out half the pot.

232
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't know what's wrong.

233
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,080
My hands aren't cooperating today.

234
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,780
Xu Ziqi is not an outsider.

235
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
You may leave.

236
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,600
Yes.

237
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,250
Why don't you change your clothes?

238
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,290
Don't underestimate Elder Yi.

239
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,610
She comes from nobility after all.

240
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
She's well-educated

241
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,040
and talented.

242
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,080
All the guild's affairs,

243
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,600
including the account books,

244
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,060
are under her management.

245
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,480
Li, oh Li,

246
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,920
what am I going to do with you?

247
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
Where on earth

248
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,980
are Elder Yi's account books?

249
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,160
We've had multiple agents investigating this for years.

250
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,960
But we only found out

251
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,160
that the mastermind is a royal relative.

252
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,600
Li.

253
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,640
If it weren't for you,

254
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
I wouldn't be in such a difficult position.

255
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,040
Hua Xiaofei.

256
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,770
Hua Xiaofei.

257
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,080
I...

258
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,200
Why are you walking so hurriedly?

259
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,000
Are you blind?

260
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
It's urgent.

261
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
I can't find anyone.

262
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,960
Actually,

263
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,890
finding a dance partner

264
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,740
isn't that difficult.

265
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,600
Do you remember what I said

266
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,840
at the Fang residence yesterday?

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,170
You were at the Fang residence yesterday?

268
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,200
Yesterday I was with Li

269
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
and Yang Lin, standing right in front of you.

270
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
If you need anything, come to me.

271
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,900
Leave Li alone.

272
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,960
Chairman Fang, I need you.

273
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,720
Did I?

274
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
I think so.

275
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
I was only thinking about Fang Lihen

277
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,080
and didn't see you.

278
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,140
What were you going to say yesterday?

279
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,260
I'm standing right in front of you like this,

280
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
don't you have any thoughts?

281
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,700
What thoughts?

282
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
What are you doing in seven days?

283
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,480
In seven days,

284
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,840
the first trial for the Flower Queen paired dance.

285
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,080
Xu Ziqi.

286
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,850
If there's anything I can help with, just ask.

287
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
You have so many people in your Buliangren group,

288
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,780
could you lend me a dance partner?

289
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,040
Go.

290
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,080
Let's go.

291
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,800
Move it.

292
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,200
Hurry up!

293
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,560
Position.

294
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,600
One, two, three, four.

295
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,400
Five, six, seven, eight.

296
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,320
Two, two, three, four.

297
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,320
Squat down and raise your hands.

298
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,200
Stand up.

299
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,080
I've taught you this routine three times already.

300
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,680
This time, try it on your own.

301
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,200
One, two, three, four.

302
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

303
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,440
Two, two, three, four.

304
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Five, six, seven, eight.

305
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,760
Turn around!

306
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,240
Jiading.

307
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
Not bad!

308
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,450
Practice a bit more,

309
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,490
and you can perform on the streets.

310
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,400
Really?

311
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,320
Everyone, come and listen to

312
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,450
Miss Xiaofei's standards for choosing a dance partner.

313
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Yes, yes, yes.

314
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,320
Handsome and well-proportioned.

315
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,800
What else?

316
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,480
Any other requirements?

317
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,840
Strong physique,

318
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,320
good coordination,

319
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,840
elegant posture,

320
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,380
and great stamina.

321
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,080
Who among you thinks

322
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,200
you can be Miss Xiaofei's dance partner?

323
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,080
We all think we can.

324
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,040
Well,

325
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,020
I'll choose Jiading then.

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,680
Really?

327
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,480
Miss Xiaofei,

328
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,920
look at my waist.

329
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,490
My back injury just healed.

330
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,080
You can't move it well.

331
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,280
You were moving it just fine earlier.

332
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,440
You...

333
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,200
Miss Xiaofei!

334
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,839
I...

335
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,680
I have a crushed Adam's apple.

336
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,880
You were shouting very loudly just now.

337
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,599
You Buliang men are all so weak.

338
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,960
No wonder Xu Ziqi

339
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,160
is known as Chang'an's top Buliang man.

340
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,240
Fine.

341
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,960
Fine.

342
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,440
Alright.

343
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,840
Okay.

344
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,480
Fine.

345
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,370
I don't believe you won't invite me to dance with you.

346
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,140
How did you like my fighting skills just now?

347
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
I think

348
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,920
it was quite good,

349
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,330
really impressive.

350
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,520
You're too kind.

351
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,920
Well...

352
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,440
So...

353
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,280
If there's no suitable candidate, I'll be going now.

354
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,200
I still need to find a dance partner.

355
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,960
Carry on.

356
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Goodbye.

357
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,420
This...

358
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,960
Boss, what's...

359
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,640
Are you cold?

360
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,200
It's almost summer,

361
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,680
how could we be cold?

362
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,840
Cold at heart.

363
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't worry, boss.

364
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,360
Come on, let's gather around the boss

365
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,640
to warm him up

366
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,600
with a group hug.

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,480
The lineup this year is incredibly strong.

368
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,120
President Fang Lihen and Miss Gu Jin'er

369
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,720
will be performing the Feitian Dance.

370
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,600
Yes, that's right.

371
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,720
And there will be personally signed

372
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,520
artwork gifts from Master Wu Daozi and Master Zhang Xu.

373
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
The opening guest is Madam Gongsun.

374
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,680
And there's also a contestant with a partner to be determined,

375
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,640
Hua Xiaofei.

376
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,400
Who is Hua Xiaofei?

377
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,000
No idea.

378
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,200
Who cares?

379
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,160
As long as we get to see some excitement.

380
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,720
Let's go.

381
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,320
Where am I supposed to find a dance partner?

382
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,240
Could my path to changing my fate through business

383
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,840
end right here?

384
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,840
Zhihan

385
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,040
Fighting alone

386
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,570
is indeed difficult to make progress.

387
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,160
But among those entering Chang'an every day,

388
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,480
none of them can fight.

389
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,760
The 'heaven-sent warrior' the Empress mentioned

390
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,680
must be someone with extraordinary fighting skills.

391
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,540
Could it be that

392
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
they haven't entered Chang'an yet?

393
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,610
Who's there?

394
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,960
Xu Ziqi

395
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,520
Xiaofei

396
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,200
What are you doing here so late?

397
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,130
I want to borrow your punching bag.

398
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,480
A whole day.

399
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,420
I offered to pay people to enter the dance competition with me,

400
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,840
but no one was willing.

401
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,720
I just don't understand.

402
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,040
There are so many men walking around,

403
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,570
are none of them short of money?

404
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,920
Didn't you see what was posted on the bulletin board?

405
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,120
Madam Gongsun herself will be judging this competition,

406
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,520
and the competitors include Fang Lihen

407
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
and Gu Jin'er, who dance like phoenixes.

408
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,760
Anyone with common sense

409
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,930
wouldn't embarrass themselves by entering.

410
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,960
Well, I...

411
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,680
Well, you

412
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,120
have no shame!

413
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,300
That's what makes you so special.

414
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,200
Get lost! You're so annoying.

415
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,880
Stop hitting me!

416
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,300
We haven't asked one more person yet.

417
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,600
Who?

418
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,170
Standing right in front of you.

419
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,480
Can you even dance?

420
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
We're not going to fight.

421
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,480
Dancing?

422
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,900
Isn't it just like boxing?

423
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
Aren't you using your hands and feet for both?

424
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
Look at my strong physique,

425
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
my coordination,

426
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,220
my graceful limbs,

427
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,720
and my endurance.

428
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,920
But when you stand there,

429
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
people think you're about to hit someone.

430
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,280
That set of moves you did the other day,

431
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,760
honestly, it got my blood pumping.

432
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,400
I was thinking,

433
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,200
if the flower queen competition was about fighting,

434
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,960
I'd definitely win with you.

435
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,480
But now we're competing for a flower queen,

436
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,960
not a gang leader.

437
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,440
Fine.

438
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,040
I'll see if you can find someone when the time comes.

439
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Let's see what you'll do if you can't find anyone.

440
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,640
If you don't look, forget it.

441
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,120
Um.

442
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,170
Hua Xiaofei.

443
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,960
Actually,

444
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
you don't need to try so hard.

445
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,440
If I don't work hard,

446
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,100
what am I supposed to eat? Air?

447
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Well.

448
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,760
Look at me,

449
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,680
I'm also

450
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,240
a perfectly healthy man

451
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,640
with working limbs, right?

452
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I can support you,

453
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,600
adopt you.

454
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,760
You want to be my godfather?

455
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,200
Who wants to be your father?

456
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,260
You're such a pain.

457
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,480
What I mean is,

458
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
we could,

459
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,480
you know...

460
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,200
Know what?

461
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,800
You know, that thing.

462
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
What exactly are you talking about?

463
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,210
Don't you think I've always

464
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,160
Always?

465
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
Don't you think I've always treated you as

466
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,880
As?

467
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,040
a brother?

468
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,840
Like sworn siblings?

469
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes, sworn siblings.

470
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,600
It's not about formalities,

471
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,400
but the sincerity of our hearts.

472
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,200
Why are you two suddenly becoming sworn siblings in the middle of the night?

473
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880
If this happened during the day

474
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,640
and people found out

475
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
that Master Xu wants to become sworn siblings

476
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
with this troublemaker,

477
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,120
This...

478
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,040
wouldn't it become a laughingstock?

479
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,120
It's nothing special,

480
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,520
just a spontaneous feeling.

481
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,000
Right,

482
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,760
a spontaneous feeling.

483
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,920
Today I ask everyone to witness

484
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,120
Brother Xu and I becoming sworn siblings.

485
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,480
That's good. If anything happens in the future,

486
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,810
Ziqi can look after you.

487
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,400
You won't be alone in Chang'an anymore.

488
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,360
Ali.

489
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,680
Why don't

490
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,880
you join our sworn sibling ceremony too?

491
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,920
If we become sworn siblings, we can't be husband and wife.

492
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,280
That's absolutely impossible.

493
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,140
Cannot be done.

494
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,240
No need. Once a brother,

495
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
always a brother.

496
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,500
I can't take on that responsibility.

497
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
Once a brother,

498
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
always a brother.

499
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,620
Kneel down and light the incense.

500
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,440
Once a brother,

501
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,240
always a brother.

502
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,560
Always a brother.

503
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,820
Hurry, kneel down and light the incense.

504
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Who's going to lead the oath?

505
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,840
Our boss Xu knows all about sworn ceremonies.

506
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,720
I think we should let Boss Xu lead.

507
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,360
Once a brother,

508
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,360
always a brother.

509
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,880
Hurry up.

510
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Heaven above,

511
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,720
earth below as witness,

512
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,680
I, Xu Ziqi,

513
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,000
hereby become sworn siblings with Hua Xiaofei.

514
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,170
Heaven above, earth below as witness,

515
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,520
I, Hua Xiaofei,

516
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,480
hereby become sworn siblings with Xu Ziqi.

517
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,960
To entrust our lives to each other,

518
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,520
to help in good times and bad,

519
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,040
to share all fortune and misfortune,

520
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,400
to support each other through hardships.

521
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,120
To entrust our lives to each other,

522
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,600
to help in good times and bad,

523
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,680
to share all fortune and misfortune,

524
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
to support each other through hardships.

525
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,340
The sun and moon bear witness,

526
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,040
heaven and earth are our testament,

527
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,440
I will hold true for life,

528
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
and never break this vow.

529
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,960
The sun and moon bear witness,

530
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,200
heaven and earth are our testament,

531
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
I will hold true for life,

532
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,840
and never break this vow.

533
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,440
Drink the brotherhood wine.

534
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,580
Swear a blood oath.

535
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,960
Yes,

536
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
a blood oath.

537
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,890
Do we really need to cut ourselves for this ceremony?

538
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,240
What's wrong with my heart?

539
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,640
Sir, look at this.

540
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
This is Mr. Xu's true intention.

541
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,480
Can't we just cut our fingers for the blood oath?

542
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,440
Are you aiming at the wrong spot?

543
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,890
I'll cut the finger.

544
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,200
Xu Ziqi!

545
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,760
Um, I'm sorry.

546
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,900
I accidentally cut a bit too deep when my hand shook.

547
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
It's my first time, so I got carried away.

548
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,480
I won't get so excited next time.

549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,460
The ceremony is complete.

550
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,960
Brother.

551
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Sworn sister.

552
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,680
From now on,

553
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,560
I'll protect you well.

554
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,360
Protect me? Yeah, right.

555
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,640
You almost cut my hand off just now.

556
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,380
You're exaggerating.

557
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,920
Anyone else want to become sworn brothers?

558
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,360
That's great!

559
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,360
It's wonderful news!

560
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,200
Good.

561
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,600
Great.

562
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Good.

563
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Sounds good.

564
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,680
Fine.

565
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,960
Alright.

566
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,000
Boss,

567
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,720
are you still cold?

568
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,300
No matter how warm the fire is,

569
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,920
my heart still feels cold.

570
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,240
Miss,

571
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,720
I'd like to ask if

572
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,840
you have any skilled male dancers here?

573
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm not sure about male dancers.

574
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,040
Xiaofei.

575
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,760
Thank you.

576
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,040
I'll do it.

577
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,280
Why are you here?

578
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,920
I heard no one would be your dance partner for the competition,

579
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,720
so I came to volunteer myself.

580
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,560
I'm already grateful that you lent me money for the rankings,

581
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,280
how could I let you risk your life for this?

582
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,720
It's just dancing, not risking my life.

583
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,040
With your physical condition, dancing

584
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,490
is basically risking your life, isn't it?

585
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,280
Why not choose someone from your Jinli Alliance brothers

586
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,200
to be my dance partner?

587
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,920
I asked them already. They all refused.

588
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,960
Why aren't you willing to help?

589
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,420
We swore never to touch our brother's woman.

590
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,380
Good brothers.

591
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Xiaofei, although I'm not good at dancing,

592
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,040
I'm willing to do it for you.

593
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,960
I'll practice through thick and thin.

594
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,760
Where there's a will, there's a way.

595
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
Only three days left.

596
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
How can we make it?

597
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Where there's a will, there's a way.

598
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
Now let's start with some stretching.

599
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,280
Okay.

600
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,490
Let's go.

601
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,600
One, two, three, four,

602
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,240
five, six, seven, eight.

603
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,690
Brother!

604
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,880
Are you okay?

605
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,170
Are you alright?

606
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,360
Brother, are you okay?

607
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,960
I'm fine.

608
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
It'll get better gradually.

609
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,540
Gather around.

610
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,120
Yes.

611
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,680
You okay?

612
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,760
Xu Ziqi.

613
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Hua Xiaofei.

614
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,440
Xu.

615
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,680
Zhang.

616
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,920
What are you doing here

617
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
with so many men?

618
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
Citizens in Chang'an reported

619
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,840
that a group of men gather here daily.

620
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,120
So it's you people.

621
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,260
Embracing each other.

622
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,280
We're practicing dance.

623
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,520
Dancing?

624
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,700
In all of Chang'an,

625
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,760
no one was willing to be Xiaofei's dance partner.

626
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,960
As her husband, it's my duty.

627
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,280
You actually chose Zhang Guicai as your dance partner?

628
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,200
Yes,

629
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,360
wasn't our dance wonderful just now?

630
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes, indeed.

631
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,480
Officer Xu, what are you...

632
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,160
Xu,

633
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,520
why are you putting your sword

634
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,440
against my neck?

635
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,880
Well...

636
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,200
I just saw Zhang's beautiful dance moves

637
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
and admired them greatly.

638
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,960
I want to become sworn brothers with Zhang.

639
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Right.

640
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,440
Yesterday when I became his sworn sister,

641
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,440
he also put his knife against my neck.

642
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,960
Really?

643
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,960
So in Chang'an,

644
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,960
this is the custom?

645
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,880
Seems even more honorable than our Jinli Alliance.

646
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,960
Brothers for life and death.

647
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
Come, let's bow.

648
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,680
Wait.

649
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,280
I need to check the almanac first

650
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,760
to find an auspicious day and time.

651
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,400
Well,

652
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,640
you two keep hugging— no, no,

653
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,680
just continue your training.

654
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,480
I'll go patrol now.

655
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,810
Let me know once you've picked a good date.

656
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,360
Farewell.

657
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,700
How amusing. Let's go.

658
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,040
Is this how everyone in Chang'an puts swords to each other's necks?

659
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,400
This is my first time seeing it too.

660
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,360
Then let's do the ceremony

661
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,280
and become sworn brothers again.

662
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,760
Boss Xu,

663
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,780
why don't we go back to warm up by the fire?

664
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,720
No need.

665
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,840
I'm completely chilled.

666
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,640
Boss Xu,

667
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,520
then let us warm you up with our bodies.

668
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,640
A hug of love!

669
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

670
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,680
The annual Chang'an Flower Queen Contest has arrived as scheduled.

671
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,160
This year we have 8 candidates.

672
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,720
All attendees can vote according to your preferences

673
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,680
and the contestants' abilities.

674
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,880
May they come out on top

675
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,640
and win the title of Flower Queen.

676
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,440
Now then,

677
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,920
let the voting

678
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,520
begin!

679
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:18,960
Sir.

680
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,250
Look at Hua Xiaofei. How could she be a courtesan?

681
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,100
She's just a country girl.

682
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

683
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
what I have here

684
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,680
are the popularity votes tallied so far.

685
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,120
We have 8 candidates in total,

686
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,600
and ranked from highest to lowest votes,

687
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,730
they are as follows:

688
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,210
First place,

689
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,960
The people's choice.

690
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,679
Gu Jin'er:

691
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,280
18,021 votes.

692
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,239
Congratulations, Miss Jin'er.

693
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Second place, Wang Lianyue:

694
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,440
7,500 votes.

695
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,440
Third place, Shen Yunyun.

696
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,920
Boss.

697
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
By comparison,

698
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,280
Miss Xiaofei's family

699
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,179
must be quite poor, right?

700
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,239
She seems a bit

701
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,650
underdeveloped, doesn't she?

702
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,210
What do you mean by 'not well-off'?

703
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,639
She's just young

704
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,940
and still growing.

705
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,639
Eighth place, Hua Xiaofei,

706
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,800
1,176 votes.

707
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,760
Congratulations to these eight contestants.

708
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,040
Sir.

709
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,320
These votes are way too low.

710
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,640
Did you vote for your sister?

711
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,440
Yes.

712
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,530
You didn't vote?

713
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,920
Of course I voted.

714
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,720
I voted.

715
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,160
I'll support her all the way.

716
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,490
Support her all the way.

717
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,840
Yes, support till the end.

718
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,480
Support till the end.

719
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:18,960
Yes.

720
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,800
Give it all to me.

721
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,440
Take out all the money

722
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
you have on you.

723
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,600
When we get back to camp, I'll check.

724
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,400
Anyone who still has money left

725
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,640
will run 200 laps carrying sandbags.

726
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,000
Come on, hand it all over.

727
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,600
Here.

728
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,330
Give it to me.

729
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,120
Sir, where are you going?

730
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,160
Sir,

731
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
this doesn't seem appropriate.

732
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,200
Don't let her lose too badly.

733
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,760
But...

734
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,140
She is a girl after all.

735
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'll vote for her.

736
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
Everyone will now draw lots

737
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,440
to determine the order and opponents.

738
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,720
The color of the ball will be the standard.

739
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,120
Same colors will be grouped together for competition.

740
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,170
Please don't let me draw Gu Jin'er.

741
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,370
I really hope I don't get Gu Jin'er.

742
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Would all contestants please show your colored balls

743
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
to reveal the final results.

744
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
Alright everyone,

745
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,320
the results are in.

746
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,480
Please look forward to

747
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,600
the preliminary dance competition.

748
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,960
After applying this moisturizing egg white water,

749
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,280
my skin is so soft and tender,

750
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,540
simply irresistible.

751
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
Come on, baby, let's apply makeup.

752
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,800
Come on, brother.

753
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,840
Watch for my hand signal.

754
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,040
When I raise my hand, cast all votes for your sister-in-law.

755
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,570
Make sure it works in one go.

756
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,320
Don't worry, brother.

757
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,480
Madam! Let me help.

758
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,860
Brother, take it easy.

759
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,080
I'll do it.

760
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,600
Slow down.

761
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,100
Have a seat.

762
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,040
Madam,

763
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,920
don't be nervous.

764
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,960
Your opponent this time is last year's flower queen.

765
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,360
They're going to perform the Flying Dance.

766
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,640
Flying Dance.

767
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,800
Even a toad needs to become a swan to dance.

768
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Keep it down.

769
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,120
Darling,

770
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,650
don't bow your head. Your crown will fall off.

771
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
All bark and no bite.

772
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,960
Don't cry later.

773
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,840
They dance really well.

774
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,760
What if I lose this round?

775
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,280
What should I do?

776
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,720
Madam, don't worry.

777
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,880
There are two rounds of competition.

778
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,440
I've got everything under control. Rest assured.

779
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,880
She thinks she can make it to the next round?

780
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,920
The Chang'an flower queen is nothing special.

781
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,300
How could she compare to my wife's youthful spirit?

782
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,000
Madam, you're the most beautiful in my eyes.

783
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Isn't that right?

784
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,920
Sir, don't purse your lips.

785
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,450
Those wretches will laugh.

786
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,960
Here.

787
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,160
Don't call me Madam. I don't deserve it.

788
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,960
You are my lawfully wedded wife.

789
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,560
How could you not deserve it?

790
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,300
This color looks nice.

791
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,720
It's fine.

792
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,760
Take a deep breath. Don't be nervous.

793
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,800
Just relax.

794
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,320
Is she a fairy?

795
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,120
Brother.

796
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,360
I can hardly breathe.

797
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,040
Take a deep breath, brother.

798
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,960
The entrance drums have sounded.

799
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,090
The celestial dance is about to begin.

800
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,440
Ladies and gentlemen,

801
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,960
about to compete with Chang'an's

802
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
most beautiful dancing duo,

803
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,600
Fang Lihen and Gu Jin'er.

804
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,720
It's that

805
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,720
unassuming Hua Xiaofei.

806
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,760
And her

807
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,600
dance partner Zhang Guicai who came from nowhere.

808
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,840
The piece they will perform together is called

809
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,320
Please Walk Slowly.

810
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,900
Quite a creative name indeed.

811
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,040
From now until the end of the dance,

812
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,800
everyone can vote freely.

813
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,000
Every 1,000 votes

814
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,540
will raise the alcohol gauge by one foot.

815
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,720
The winner will be determined by the highest gauge.

816
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,800
The stage is our boundary.

817
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,640
Those who enter the stage cannot withdraw

818
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,970
and must cooperate to complete the dance.

819
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,280
Now first,

820
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,760
let's welcome the long-awaited

821
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,240
Flying Apsara.

822
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,920
This is...

823
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,480
Look!

824
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,600
It's beautiful.

825
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,380
Be careful!

826
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Zhang Guicai, you...

827
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,440
You traitor!

828
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,240
Why did brother go up there?

829
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,160
Are you alright, fairy?

830
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,660
What are you doing?

831
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,220
What are you all doing?

832
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,520
I don't even know what I'm doing.

833
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,960
A new contestant has entered.

834
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,560
According to the competition rules,

835
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,020
please work together to complete the dance.

836
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,400
Let me go.

837
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,960
I got it.

838
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,960
You're so clever.

839
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,520
Your wife is going to win this time, right?

840
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,000
Yes,

841
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,480
definitely winning.

842
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,800
Fairy girl.

843
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,240
Zhang Guicai.

844
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,760
Zhang Guicai.

845
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,760
Fairy.

846
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Zhang Guicai.

847
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,000
The previous Feitian dance

848
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,320
was amazing.

849
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,360
Now, let's give a warm welcome to

850
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,360
Hua Xiaofei to the stage.

851
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,690
Please watch your step.

852
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,050
Hua Xiaofei and her dance partner.

853
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,400
Miss Xiaofei.

854
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,960
According to the rules of the Flower Queen competition,

855
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,160
if you don't have a partner for the duet,

856
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,400
you'll be automatically disqualified.

857
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,520
I can't possibly dance alone.

858
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,580
Yes, that's right.

859
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,490
Where's her dance partner?

860
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,360
The dance partner is here.
