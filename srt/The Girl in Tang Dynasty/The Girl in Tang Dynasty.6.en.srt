1
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,280
Oh God.

2
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
Are you messing with me?

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
You're scared now.

4
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,440
Praying to heaven.

5
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,360
If I had known you'd be in my fate,

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,060
I wouldn't have agreed to this competition.

7
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,009
So you're giving up?

8
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,980
You went to great lengths to lure me here,

9
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,320
and made such a show of challenging me.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,540
Let me tell you.

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,920
Today we're having this competition,

12
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,560
No way.

13
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,640
whether you like it or not.

14
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,120
That's right.

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,680
Indeed.

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,079
Otherwise everyone in Chang'an will think

17
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,960
you're just here to make me look good.

18
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,490
Deliberately hyping up Yingyan's products.

19
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Your Yingyan company

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,320
isn't really that good.

21
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,800
Yingyan has dominated Chang'an for three years.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Why would I fear you?

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Everyone has their destined downfall.

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,800
And I am yours.

25
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,240
Wake up.

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,010
Don't be so overconfident.

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,960
I don't believe

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,360
you can bring me down.

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,079
If I really do overthrow you,

30
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,680
don't hold a grudge.

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
Ridiculous.

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,680
I, Yingxiong, am Chang'an's

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
number one makeup artist for the nobility.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,530
Why would I fear you?

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,410
Then let's get started.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's do this.

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
Okay.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,170
We still need to have the competition.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,120
Otherwise it wouldn't make sense.

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,640
I've worked really hard

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,460
to gain this much popularity.

42
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,420
But I can't completely crush him.

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,170
If he really turns out to be my future husband,

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,920
he would hate me forever.

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,690
I'd better go easy on him

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,400
and let it end in a tie.

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,560
On my way here just now.

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,320
I've thought about it carefully.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
Lead powder is harmful to health,

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
but it's not inevitable.

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,520
We just need to add a barrier

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,060
between the lead powder and skin.

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
Rice powder.

54
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,360
It's pure and natural,

55
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
can be made at home,

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,820
and is easily accessible.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,060
Ladies, please watch.

58
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,690
First apply a layer of rice powder,

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,519
then apply Yingyan's lead powder on top.

60
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,120
How white!

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,660
Doesn't it look even more fair

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,320
with skin white as snow?

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
Yes, it really does look fairer.

64
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,000
Master Yingxiong truly has brilliant ideas.

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Double effectiveness,

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,820
locking in the whiteness.

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,240
Um...

68
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,000
Does your Ying family never set makeup?

69
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,420
Set makeup?

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,659
Never mind.

71
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,500
Young Master Ying.

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Here.

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,880
Although your Ying family's face powder dissolves in water,

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
doesn't last long,

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,320
it's easy to remove,

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,560
which saves time. That's a big advantage, right?

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,120
This

78
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,970
is the best-selling Yingyan eyebrow pencil in all of Chang'an.

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
Made from premium charcoal,

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
it's deep black and rich in color.

81
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Easy to apply and blend,

82
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,740
creating a natural and elegant look.

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
Well, let me see

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,880
if it can create those bold, striking eyebrows.

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,560
This is charcoal.

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,200
Couldn't you at least make some packaging?

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,520
Look, it's brittle

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,240
and messy.

89
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,960
Indeed.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,020
How did it break so easily?

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,760
The quality is poor.

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,159
I usually visit clients' homes personally

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,050
to apply makeup for the ladies.

94
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,680
I never thought that something

95
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,000
so convenient for me

96
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
would be so difficult

97
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
for others to use.

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,220
What happened to going easy on me?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,240
Today I'd like to invite everyone to witness

100
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,370
a giant leap in beauty history.

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
This cloth is not just an ordinary cloth,

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,760
but a facial mask sheet.

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,380
Yes, that's great.

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
When ladies apply facial masks daily,

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,200
don't you struggle with the stuff on your face

106
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
constantly falling off?

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,360
With this sheet,

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,560
you can apply the mashed facial ingredients.

109
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,090
When wrapped in a face mask,

110
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,320
you won't have these troubles anymore.

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,680
This is indeed much more convenient.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,200
Yes.

113
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,880
Exactly.

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
Hero could think of this solution,

115
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
it's truly impressive.

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,000
Everyone, please look.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,930
Apply another layer of mask cloth,

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,930
this way the cucumber slices are wrapped inside,

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,530
they won't easily fall off.

120
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,240
And this cloth,

121
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,140
I've chosen coarse fabric

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,060
as the material for the face mask.

123
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
The texture has many ridges, making it easy to adhere.

124
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,000
From now on when you apply face masks,

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,200
you won't lose any of the essence.

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,800
This design is amazing, really impressive!

127
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
Why did this fall off?

128
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Didn't you say it wouldn't fall off?

129
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,520
First, we take an egg.

130
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Then we extract the egg white.

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Regularly applying egg white on your face

132
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,740
can achieve a skin-renewing effect.

133
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,320
I've been using egg white water masks since I was little.

134
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,760
It locks in moisture.

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,440
Especially when used on dry, flaky skin,

136
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,300
the results are most noticeable.

137
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
This is a hydrating egg white toner,

138
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,800
my exclusive moisturizing creation.

139
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,520
The egg white water really works.

140
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,880
Mr. Ying, please.

141
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,799
Come on.

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
How does it

143
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
feel?

144
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,920
It's much more hydrated now.

145
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,800
Really? It actually works?

146
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
This girl is amazing.

147
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
I'm going to try it when I get home.

148
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,160
No need to eat eggs anymore.

149
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Thank you all for your kindness.

150
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,080
Everyone has been very complimentary

151
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,480
about Yingyan products.

152
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,320
Today I finally realized.

153
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
It was my stubbornness

154
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,020
that led me to sell harmful

155
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,850
and poor-quality products

156
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,560
to all of you.

157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
That's so cruel.

158
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,690
I, Yingxiong, solemnly promise today

159
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,320
that until I develop

160
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,290
products that benefit health,

161
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,130
Yingyan Cosmetics Shop

162
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,440
will remain closed.

163
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,610
You need to give us an explanation!

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,440
All the products

165
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,260
you've purchased before,

166
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,320
I will take them all back

167
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,260
and provide full refunds.

168
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,060
That's not necessary.

169
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,160
Let's go.

170
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,640
Young Master Ying, where are you going?

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,960
Make way!

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,320
What are you doing?

173
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,380
Young Master Ying!

174
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,840
Oh no!

175
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
We're in trouble now.

176
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,080
Get me out of here quickly.

177
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,140
Young Master Ying!

178
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,920
Are you alright?

179
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,960
You've upset the young master.

180
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,840
I'll make you pay with your life!

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,760
Young Master!

182
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,500
Will you ever stop?

183
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,840
Move aside!

184
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Get out of the way!

185
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Don't leave, Young Master Ying!

186
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,540
When are you going to exchange it?

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I just wanted to get some attention.

188
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,290
How did it turn into such a mess?

189
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,440
Sir.

190
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
Wasn't Miss Xiaofei competing against Young Master Ying?

191
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,850
There was such a huge crowd.

192
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,920
It really put Master Xu in a difficult situation.

193
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Master Xu was so pressured by those girls.

194
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,800
He couldn't even climb over the wall to escape.

195
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,680
Guess what happened?

196
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,440
What?

197
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,340
Steward Yang's daughter, Miss Yang.

198
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
She rode her horse into the crowd.

199
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,380
Grabbed Master Xu's hand.

200
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,960
And then they tried to escape on horseback.

201
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,720
What's happening now?

202
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,560
Those girls.

203
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Some are blocking the horse.

204
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,810
Others are chasing after them.

205
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,240
These girls usually appear so refined and proper.

206
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
But when they see Master Xu.

207
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,200
They run so incredibly fast!

208
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,930
What happened next?

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,560
Then... then I don't know anymore.

210
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,960
But sir.

211
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,200
After Miss Xiaofei finished the competition.

212
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
She even accompanied Young Master Ying back to the Yingyan Cosmetics Shop.

213
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,600
She claimed she would accompany Young Master Ying back home.

214
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,320
She even made

215
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,440
some kind of

216
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,860
rock sugar white fungus soup for him.

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,680
Come, Hero.

218
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,690
I made this white fungus soup especially for you.

219
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
What

220
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,080
am I doing?

221
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,200
You,

222
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
get away from him!

223
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,080
Me?

224
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,840
Yes,

225
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm talking to you.

226
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,920
Hero has severe gynophobia.

227
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,320
He's been fine these past few years.

228
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,720
But after your disturbance today,

229
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
his old condition has returned.

230
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,320
Gynophobia?

231
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,560
Yes,

232
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,560
he gets sick at the sight of women.

233
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
Just as you can see now.

234
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,600
But wasn't he fine just now?

235
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
Miss Hua, what you don't know is

236
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,280
Young Master Ying was originally a prince from the Women's Kingdom.

237
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,940
The Women's Kingdom values females over males.

238
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Even as a prince,

239
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,680
his life was worth less than dirt.

240
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,740
Over time, he developed gynophobia.

241
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,440
Until he came to our Great Tang

242
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,840
and experienced how men are respected here.

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,080
Only then did his condition gradually improve.

244
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,410
Your disturbance has ruined everything.

245
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,200
His relapse

246
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,920
is indeed my fault.

247
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,600
Hero, I'll stay with you until you recover.

248
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,780
I just told you he has gynophobia,

249
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,280
and you still want to stay with him?

250
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,880
Are you trying to send him to his grave earlier?

251
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Guards!

252
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
Hero.

253
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,080
Hero.

254
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,770
You even escort him home

255
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,200
and make soup for him?

256
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,800
Yes.

257
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,680
But after Young Master Ying finished the tournament,

258
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,810
it seems his fear of women resurfaced.

259
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,900
The doctor said

260
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,960
he probably won't be able

261
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,940
to see anyone for about two weeks.

262
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
But Miss Xiaofei said

263
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,200
she will take responsibility for Young Master Ying.

264
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,460
Take responsibility?

265
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,800
But

266
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,540
who would believe what a troublemaker says?

267
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,440
Where are you going, sir?

268
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,370
Going for a walk.

269
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,800
Why have you come here, sir?

270
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,440
Good day, sir.

271
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,680
Sir,

272
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm here for a walk

273
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,480
and to breathe in the atmosphere of everyday life.

274
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,080
Go buy groceries right away.

275
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,840
Sir, today's groceries have already been purchased.

276
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,440
Go check if anything was missed.

277
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,040
Hurry up!

278
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,280
Last night, more than 10 dishes were prepared in my residence.

280
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,140
It's one thing not to dine at home.

281
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
She lives in my house,

282
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,080
eats my food,

283
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
uses my things,

284
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,320
and even takes my white fungus and rock sugar

285
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
to make soup for another man.

286
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,920
You and I are destined to be together.

287
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,320
Destined.

288
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,560
Chairman.

289
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
This twist of fate

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,570
was all meant for me to meet you.

291
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,200
Come, hero.

292
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,450
Let me feed you some white fungus soup.

293
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,160
Fire! Fire!

294
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,440
There's a fire!

295
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,680
Hurry!

296
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Quick!

297
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,960
Hurry up!

298
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,920
The kitchen is on fire!

299
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,850
Save the master!

300
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,680
Over there!

301
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,080
Hurry! The kitchen is on fire!

302
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,720
Save the master quickly!

303
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Hurry!

304
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,920
This way!

305
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,080
Hurry!

306
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Erha, what happened?

307
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,810
Our master set himself on fire!

308
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,480
Where is Ali? Take me there quickly!

309
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,920
Yes.

310
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
Go get some water!

311
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,560
Hurry up!

312
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,680
Make way!

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,640
Sir, you cannot go in.

314
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,840
Sir, please don't go in.

315
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,440
Sir!

316
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Sir! Sir!

317
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
Sir, don't go!

318
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,200
Why did he rush in there?

319
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,440
What should we do now?

320
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,119
Sir!

321
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:07,920
Sir!

322
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,170
Master Fang!

323
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,200
Fang Lihen

324
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Fang Lihen!

325
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,680
Hua Xiaofei

326
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
Don't take another step forward.

327
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
Leave now.

328
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,960
Immediately.

329
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,720
What happened to Fang Lihen?

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Why is he lying there motionless

331
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,650
with a white cloth over him?

332
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,880
Fang Lihen!

333
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,760
Hua Xiaofei!

334
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,840
From the first day you arrived in Chang'an

335
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,880
until today,

336
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
nothing good has happened.

337
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,480
You nearly cost me my job

338
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,540
and caused this tragedy to happen to Ali.

339
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,020
Do you have a heart?

340
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,360
Everything you do

341
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,960
is only for your own benefit.

342
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,440
I...

343
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,680
I never meant to harm Fang Lihen.

344
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,440
Yesterday you told Ali that you admired him.

345
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,240
Yes.

346
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
Then why

347
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
did you flirt with Young Master Ying today?

348
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
You triggered Young Master Ying's gynophobia again.

349
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,760
Ali felt his sincere feelings were betrayed

350
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
and set fire in anger.

351
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,960
I swear,

352
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,520
I truly had no intention of harming Fang Lihen.

353
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Everything I did

354
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,360
was out of necessity.

355
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Out of necessity?

356
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
You blame everything

357
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,520
on necessity.

358
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,140
Where is your bottom line?

359
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,620
Where is your conscience?

360
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,420
You're so greedy for money

361
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,020
that you'd kill for it.

362
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
You don't deserve to be loved at all.

363
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,220
I don't deserve it?

364
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,840
I've tried so hard.

365
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,720
Tried hard?

366
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
You've only tried hard to murder for money.

367
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,600
All you care about is money.

368
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,240
I think

369
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,840
you'll be lucky not to be punished by heaven.

370
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,300
I admit I sometimes use unscrupulous means.

371
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
I admit it and I'm willing to change.

372
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
But I swear,

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
I absolutely had

374
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
no intention of harming Fang Lihen.

375
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
If I did,

376
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,680
may I be struck by lightning.

377
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,920
Hua Xiaofei! Hua Xiaofei!

378
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,240
Li.

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Was I too harsh with my words?

380
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,410
I can't believe it summoned lightning to strike her.

381
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,960
Am I dreaming?

382
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
The strike was very real.

383
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,960
She was even smoking.

384
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,040
This...

385
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,160
The two of us

386
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,020
only wanted to teach her a lesson.

387
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,570
How could it bring divine punishment?

388
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,250
The doctor said she's fine.

389
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,760
Just probably fainted from exhaustion.

390
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,890
She needs some rest.

391
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,960
What if

392
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,000
she finds out we deceived her?

393
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,960
She'll kill us.

394
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,880
Erha,

395
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,880
go check on Hua Xiaofei's room immediately.

396
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Yes, sir.

397
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,600
Sir,

398
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,400
Hua Xiaofei is sound asleep in her room.

399
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,160
Go and take out

400
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
all sharp objects from her room.

401
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,720
And bowls too. Broken bowls can be used to cut wrists.

402
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,520
Yes, sir.

403
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,840
Sir.

404
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,120
Well,

405
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,640
Look,

406
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,880
we must properly compensate her.

407
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,500
Give her money.

408
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,280
But how much money should we give

409
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
to make her happy?

410
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,970
According to Tang Dynasty law,

411
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,480
the more severe the injury, the higher the compensation.

412
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,000
Does Tang Dynasty law say anything

413
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,460
about compensation for getting someone struck by lightning?

414
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,480
Tang Dynasty law

415
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
only covers man-made disasters, not natural calamities.

416
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,560
So there's no precedent.

417
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,480
Let's try another approach.

418
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,680
What else does she like besides money?

419
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
Otherwise...

420
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
Let's make her think

421
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,960
this was all just a dream.

422
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,280
Oh my!

423
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,880
Was I struck dead by lightning?

424
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,300
Could it be that

425
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,200
they're all candidates to be my future husband?

426
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,040
Am I dreaming?

427
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,440
No, wait.

428
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,810
Aren't there enough options already?

429
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,960
Heaven, can't you show me some mercy?

430
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,960
I made one choice and got struck like this.

431
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,890
And now there are even more of them.

432
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,440
It doesn't matter how handsome they are.

433
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,520
You may have high status,

434
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,440
great wealth,

435
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
and moral integrity.

436
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,620
Handsome and extraordinary.

437
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,900
I'm asking you a question.

438
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,600
I can feel it.

439
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,440
This feels too real.

440
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,840
But I was clearly struck by lightning.

441
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,760
Could it be that I was so obsessed with marriage

442
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,440
that I kidnapped you all while sleepwalking?

443
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,920
Where exactly did you come from?

444
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Where from?

445
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,440
You.

446
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,040
You two are behind this.

447
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,720
Don't hit me. Stop it.

448
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,680
I won't hit you. Don't run away.

449
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:32,680
Stop hitting!

450
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,280
Don't run!

451
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,280
Stop running!

452
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,080
If you don't hit us, we won't run.

453
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,120
You

454
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,180
Stop. Stop.

455
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,090
Stand still.

456
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Stay right there.

457
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
You actually tricked me.

458
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,490
We just wanted to say

459
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,360
you're always so fickle with romantic relationships,

460
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,160
and wanted to teach you a lesson.

461
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,960
But unexpectedly there was a strange phenomenon,

462
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,160
and you got struck by lightning.

463
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,960
That's right.

464
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,640
So then we thought about how to make it up to you.

465
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,200
So you two tricked me yesterday,

466
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,000
and I got struck by lightning as a result,

467
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,060
and now you're finding new ways to call me promiscuous,

468
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,530
even sending four men to humiliate me?

469
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
Not to humiliate you.

470
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,490
It's compensation.

471
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,160
In your eyes,

472
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,530
am I just someone with no moral standards?

473
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,860
I'm not staying here anymore.

474
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,840
You really think that in all of Chang'an,

475
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,500
I have to help you two cowards?

476
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,760
Those two bastards.

477
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
They're really gone.

478
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
They really left.

479
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,920
Are you okay?

480
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,440
I'm fine.

481
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,260
Please come in.

482
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,040
How do you like it?

483
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,120
This is our Yingchun Inn.

484
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,000
The most luxurious room we have.

485
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
It's acceptable.

486
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,680
If you need anything, just let me know.

487
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,340
If not, I'll head downstairs.

488
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,160
You may go.

489
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,690
Alright.

490
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,480
Those two scoundrels may have deceived me,

491
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,960
but some of what they said wasn't completely false.

492
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,440
Finding a husband is such an important matter,

493
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,840
yet those ancestors

494
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,400
couldn't give me more clues?

495
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In this vast city of Chang'an,

496
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,240
is there truly no place for me, Hua Xiaofei?

497
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,880
In this city of Chang'an,

498
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,660
is there really no woman willing to marry me?

499
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,600
Have you seen Hua Xiaofei?

500
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,440
No, I haven't.

501
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,040
Excuse me,

502
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,500
have you seen Hua Xiaofei?

503
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,540
Never seen her.

504
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,700
Have you seen Hua Xiaofei?

505
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,160
Mr. Xu.

506
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,440
Why are you stopping me?

507
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,900
Have you seen Hua Xiaofei?

508
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,440
Mr. Xu, let me ask you something.

509
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,840
Who is this Hua Xiaofei to you?

510
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,480
You've been running around for her time and again.

511
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,140
Whenever there's the slightest issue with her,

512
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
you become completely distraught.

513
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,290
Get to the point.

514
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,160
There are countless women in Chang'an,

515
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,080
but in my opinion,

516
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,640
in your eyes,

517
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,440
there is only Hua Xiaofei.

518
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,440
These ancestors didn't leave any clues.

519
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,360
Which temple to pray at? Which incense to burn?

520
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,040
They couldn't even leave me a sign.

521
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,760
What is this?

522
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,680
Charges.

523
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,440
What does it say?

524
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,970
Charges.

525
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,000
Hua Xiaofei. She is Hua Xiaofei.

526
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,440
Come look! It's her!

527
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,480
Extorting money from innocent young women.

528
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,440
Plotting against loyal court officials.

529
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,600
Defaming the reputation of the Chamber of Commerce president.

530
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,120
Spreading obscene and immoral influences. It's her!

531
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,520
Beat her!

532
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,480
Hit her!

533
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,160
I'll kill you!

534
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,760
Beat her!

535
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,200
The heart is like the face.

536
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,720
That's why we take great care of it.

537
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,960
Once the face is not properly cleaned,

538
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,920
it becomes dirty and stained.

539
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,100
Once the heart is not cultivated,

540
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,640
evil will enter it.

541
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,920
Yang Debiao.

542
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,200
Sir.

543
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,960
May I ask why you've come to the Imperial Academy today,

544
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,680
sir?

545
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,760
I am the top investigator in Chang'an.

546
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,820
I've solved nearly a thousand cases.

547
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,560
I've already determined

548
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,040
that this manifesto came from here.

549
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,920
How did you determine

550
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,040
that this manifesto came from our academy?

551
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,300
I wrote the manifesto.

552
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
I'll take responsibility for my own actions.

553
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,960
Don't trouble the teacher.

554
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,520
Good.

555
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,200
I knew it was you.

556
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,680
I order you to withdraw all the manifestos immediately.

557
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,040
The manifestos can be withdrawn,

558
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,760
but everyone in Chang'an already knows about it.

559
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,160
How will you withdraw it from their hearts?

560
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,060
Why did you write this manifesto?

561
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,920
Teacher, Hua Xiaofei

562
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,040
has turned Chang'an city upside down.

563
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,640
As a scholar,

564
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,440
shouldn't I alert the public?

565
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,640
Alert the public?

566
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,200
What you've written is complete nonsense.

567
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,920
Is that so?

568
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,490
Then which part of what I said is wrong?

569
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
If what I said is truly wrong,

570
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,540
are all the people in Chang'an fools?

571
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,140
How could they respond so readily to my call?

572
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,160
Sir, Officer Xu.

573
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,600
How could you commit such a disrespectful act?

574
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,290
Yang Lin.

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,880
Tell everyone not to stay in the mansion.

576
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,840
Go out and search.

577
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
You must find her.

578
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
But sir,

579
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,770
the four elders are waiting for you

580
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
to discuss the Flower Queen selection.

581
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,280
If you don't go now, you'll be late.

582
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,960
I know.

583
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
I'll go by myself.

584
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,050
You go find Hua Xiaofei too.

585
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,600
Sir,

586
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
you're going to the guild?

587
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,840
I must follow along.

588
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,880
One more person is always better than one less.

589
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Stop talking. Go now.

590
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,480
Yes.

591
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
Lift the sedan chair.

592
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,040
Go find them quickly.

593
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,640
Yes.

594
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
Fang Lihen.

595
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,200
Sir Fang.

596
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,920
Sir, Mr. Fang.

597
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,880
Take care on your way.

598
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,400
How's it going? Did you find her?

599
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
I know I was wrong.

600
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
I will leave this place forever.

601
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,680
Leave all of you forever.

602
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,760
Xiaofei

603
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,040
What does she mean by that?

604
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,600
She's not thinking of hurting herself, is she?

605
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,120
I...

606
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,850
I thought she just didn't want us anymore.

607
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,159
Then hurry up and go find her!

608
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,159
By the way, if you find her,

609
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,639
make sure she can stay in Chang'an City.

610
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,170
Yang Lin, you go search too.

611
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,920
Yes.

612
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Where's the gong?

613
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,820
What's all this money for?

614
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,810
What's going on?

615
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,520
I am Xu Ziqi, the top bounty hunter in Chang'an.

616
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,600
A few days ago,

617
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,760
you ladies arranged a blind date between Hua Xiaofei and me.

618
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,040
I was the one who broke our appointment first.

619
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Please everyone,

620
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,530
don't give Hua Xiaofei a hard time.

621
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,920
So I apologize to all you ladies here.

622
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,720
All the silver paid for matchmaking

623
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,360
will be returned to everyone.

624
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,020
Please take your silver back.

625
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,360
Sir, do you think we want money?

626
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,280
What we want is you, sir!

627
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,840
That's right!

628
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Sir, I want to date you.

629
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,960
I want to meet you for matchmaking.

630
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
I want to find love with you.

631
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,880
Yes!

632
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,000
We want to pursue love with you.

633
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,480
Sir, please meet with us for matchmaking.

634
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,080
Sir!

635
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,120
If I agree to meet with all of you,

636
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,400
will you stop bothering Hua Xiaofei?

637
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,920
Yes.

638
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,000
We definitely won't trouble her anymore.

639
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,530
Alright.

640
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,440
Great!

641
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,720
Blind date.

642
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,040
I'm sorry. I'm a bit excited.

643
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,720
Master Xu.

644
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,320
Miss,

645
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
please calm down.

646
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I can't calm down.

647
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,240
You know, I really admire you.

648
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,240
So many girls

649
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,560
like you.

650
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,480
I truly admire your talent.

651
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,000
Really?

652
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,600
Is this your father?

653
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,800
No.

654
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,780
This is the famous painter Mr. Wu from Chang'an.

655
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,600
I specially invited Mr. Wu to paint for me and you.

656
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,260
Let's paint a portrait of us two as a memento.

657
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm so sorry, Mr. Xu.

658
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,040
I don't know what's wrong with my hand.

659
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,960
It's just not cooperating today.

660
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,720
I apologize for my rudeness.

661
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,320
I just wanted you to use your beautiful hand

662
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,540
to give me your autograph, would you?

663
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,480
Please.

664
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,880
I really like you.

665
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,080
Please sign for me.

666
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,640
Mr. Xu, I'm begging you for your signature.

667
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm so hungry.

668
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,080
I really want to eat something.

669
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,640
Pretty lady,

670
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,120
why don't

671
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,720
we brothers have some fun with her tonight?

672
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,440
Not bad at all.

673
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,080
You...

674
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,720
You... don't come

675
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,300
any closer!

676
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,440
Come on.

677
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,400
It's okay, it's me.

678
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,460
Don't be afraid, everything's fine.

679
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,020
You scared me to death.

680
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,360
Chang'an is too big.

681
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,260
Hard to find my way around.

682
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm late.

683
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,320
I'm sorry.

684
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,440
Well...

685
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,720
What are you laughing at? Stop laughing.

686
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,120
Um...

687
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm hungry.

688
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,160
Well then,

689
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,210
let me take you somewhere to eat, okay?

690
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,570
Let's go.

691
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,040
I...

692
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm too hungry to walk.

693
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,920
Fine.

694
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,880
Get on.

695
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,560
Isn't this Mr. Xu?

696
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,800
Please, come in.

697
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
Got your energy back?

698
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,090
Let's go.

699
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,090
Please, sir.

700
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,800
All of these

701
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
are your favorite dishes, sir.

702
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,920
Here, please enjoy.

703
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:31,920
Delicious.

704
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,400
Here.

705
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,960
Thank you.

706
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,720
Try this.

707
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
You've come at the perfect time.

708
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,560
These clothes have just been washed.

709
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,600
They'll be useful at Anpingle.

710
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,560
Thank you for your kindness.

711
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,690
I'm truly grateful.

712
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,480
However...

713
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,520
Mr. Xu, there's no need for formality.

714
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,840
You've taken on Anpingle by yourself,

715
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,360
sheltering the poor and needy.

716
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,800
It's truly admirable.

717
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,640
With prices soaring these days,

718
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,120
expenses are three times what they used to be.

719
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,800
Your shop isn't wealthy to begin with.

720
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,040
Please don't subsidize Anpingle anymore.

721
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,520
Sir, please don't say that.

722
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,920
I just want to do what little I can.

723
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,560
Please enjoy your meal.

724
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,000
I'll take my leave now.

725
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,040
Anpingle?

726
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,000
Xu Ziqi, what's going on?

727
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,920
Well, it's

728
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,840
a house outside the city.

729
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,520
A house?

730
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,900
During my patrols,

731
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,720
I often see homeless people.

732
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,560
So I thought they could stay there,

733
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,360
at least to have shelter from the elements.

734
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
So you're doing charity work.

735
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,320
From what the boss said,

736
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,600
you've taken in many people.

737
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,400
So you must have a

738
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,240
very large house?

739
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,240
It's my family's ancestral home.

740
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,080
After my great-grandfather acquired this house,

741
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,120
he sacrificed his life for the country.

742
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,920
For three generations, my family has had only one heir.

743
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,520
Now we have this empty house

744
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,800
with no one living there.

745
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,000
My ancestors were always concerned about the common people.

746
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,880
So I thought,

747
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,640
if I could use this house to do some good,

748
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,300
it would honor my ancestors' memory.

749
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,480
So in other words,

750
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,610
you're actually a rich person with a mansion.

751
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Hua Xiaofei,

752
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,020
why do you only focus on these things?

753
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,520
No, I'm sorry.

754
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,480
You

755
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,000
know what I mean.

756
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,890
You're poor, right?

757
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,160
Yes.

758
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,160
No, what I meant was

759
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,360
so that's where all your money goes.

760
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,880
Yes, and I'm up to my neck in debt.

761
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,800
That's true.

762
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,440
Taking care of so many elderly and orphaned children

763
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,040
must cost a fortune.

764
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,240
Why don't you keep some for yourself?

765
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,920
Three generations of my family have sacrificed for our country.

766
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,780
All for the people's well-being.

767
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,560
How could I be stingy?

768
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,940
You're such a fool.

769
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,360
Master Xu.

770
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,850
Thank you for protecting all of us.

771
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,040
Let me handle this small matter.

772
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,360
Do you have a fever?

773
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,540
Your face is so red.

774
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,040
No.

775
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,120
I've been practicing a type of internal martial arts lately.

776
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,520
Whenever I use this skill,

777
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,360
this happens.

778
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,960
Where do you plan to go after this?

779
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,440
I don't know.

780
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,880
Why don't you

781
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,850
just find someone to marry?

782
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,320
Me?

783
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
Who would want me?

784
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,080
True.

785
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,900
Who would want you anyway?

786
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,500
You're the last person who should talk, you lonely dog.

787
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,800
Who?

788
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,480
Xu Ziqi!

789
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,700
Where did that dart come from?

790
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,080
What's going on?

791
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,800
You...

792
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:42,880
Stay

793
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,480
still!
