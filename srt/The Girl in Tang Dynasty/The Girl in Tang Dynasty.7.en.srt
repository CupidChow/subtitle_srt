1
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,960
Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,440
Stay still. Come with me.

3
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,440
I...

4
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Brother

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,000
Calm down.

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,000
What should we do?

7
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,960
Lord Xu.

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,640
That girl was kidnapped.

9
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
Where did they go?

10
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
To the tavern.

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Boss, please catch the fish.

12
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,360
Have a safe trip.

13
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Wish you good luck.

14
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,850
Great fortune. Great fortune.

15
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,480
Well...

16
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
You...

17
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,680
On our wedding day,

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,520
River God was missing and couldn't be found.

19
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,640
But the Lucky Carp Alliance can't live without a sacred object.

20
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,770
So I reprimanded a huge amount of money

21
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,240
to make this glazed colorful carp statue.

22
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,620
Whenever something big happens,

23
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,079
we will catch fish

24
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,200
God of River, please bless us.

25
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,640
Fishing.

26
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,520
Zheng, I've been looking for you

27
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
I've been looking for you.

28
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
And I'm trying my best to build the Lucky Carp Alliance.

29
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
I hope the spirit of the Lucky Carp Alliance

30
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,360
can spread across the world.

31
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,520
All these years, I've saved up some hard-earned money

32
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,640
It's enough for us

33
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
and our future children.

34
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,040
for our future child.

35
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,760
And now,

36
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,800
my business to Chang'an.

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,700
It's a high-ranking and powerful position.

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
But I still remember our engagement.

39
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,120
I am

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
I am an upright

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
and cares about the world.

42
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,440
So...

43
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,320
Zheng.

44
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
I propose to you

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,120
officially propose to you.

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I...

47
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,760
I hope you will obey your parents' orders.

48
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,159
The matchmaker's words.

49
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Be my wife.

50
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,890
Are you willing?

51
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,000
a high-ranking and powerful man?

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,320
and upright.

53
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,640
He has a great waist.

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Handsome

55
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,000
Handsome.

56
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,120
I didn't say I'm handsome.

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,680
Yes.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,080
I do look ordinary.

59
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,440
God, are you playing me again?

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
Xiao Zheng.

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,880
I really mean it.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,880
Then...

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,800
One more time.

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,160
Forget it.

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,360
Who are you?

66
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Who are you?

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Can't you see?

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,840
My brother is proposing.

69
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,560
Proposal?

70
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Chief Zhang, right?

71
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,580
Do we know each other well?

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,320
We've only met twice.

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,010
You call this familiar?

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,200
Xiao Zheng.

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,930
We get to know each other again.

76
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
The first time we met, he bowed to me.

77
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,880
The second time we met, you proposed to me.

78
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,760
You have no requirements for marriage.

79
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,680
and your future wife

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,520
to your future wife?

81
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,680
And do you know me?

82
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
Besides, men have gold on their knees.

83
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,760
so easily?

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,640
Or do you think

85
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
you're cute.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,680
Boss.

87
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm running away.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,200
What are you doing?

89
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,010
You're proposing to me.

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
You want to be with me?

91
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,880
Are you stupid or taking advantage of me?

92
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,440
Zheng.

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,320
Why does she sound like she's talking about me?

94
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
I will protect you.

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,610
You're taking advantage of me.

96
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,560
What if I really have no choice but to say yes?

97
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Isn't that good?

98
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
Good for you.

99
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,640
Because I promised you,

100
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,880
But we don't know each other at all.

101
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,560
We were together because of our impulse.

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,020
In the end, you are not the one I want to marry.

103
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
No love, no future.

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,650
Do you know what will happen in the end?

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,320
I'll die.

106
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll die.

107
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,890
Understand? I don't want to see you again.

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
Zheng!

109
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,760
Brother

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Be careful.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,960
My waist.

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
Why is she leaving again?

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,240
Look.

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
She said she's going to choose the Oiran.

115
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
Famous prostitute?

116
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,760
Yes, let me see.

117
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,200
Yes, then...

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
What are they doing?

119
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,890
Pick the Oiran on the stage.

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,320
Famous prostitute!

121
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
Famous prostitute?

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
It represents wealth and beauty

123
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,530
and beauty in Chang'an.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,460
The girl who wins the Oiran

125
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,640
will not only get a certain reputation,

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,520
but also be favored

127
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,760
in Chang'an.

128
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,760
Gu Jin'er has been the Oiran for three consecutive years.

129
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
No one in Chang'an

130
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,000
in Chang'an.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Since choosing a husband is so complicated,

132
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,760
it's better to focus on your career.

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
If I become the Oiran,

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,320
I might make a lot of money.

135
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,140
Then you can become the richest woman first.

136
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,000
How?

137
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,960
What are you doing?

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,200
To choose the Oiran.

139
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,200
What will you sign up for?

140
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you going to say it or not?

141
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,680
I...

142
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,140
Ping Kang Fang is looking for Mr. Xue.

143
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
Where are you going?

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,760
Don't follow me.

145
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,560
I'm going to do something women do.

146
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Five, six.

147
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
Coach Xue.

148
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
Seven, eight.

149
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,600
Three, two.

150
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,320
Coach Xue.

151
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,440
Come on.

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,960
Why are you pulling me?

153
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,320
I want to run for the Oiran.

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,800
You...

155
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
be the Oiran.

156
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,890
Are you out of your mind?

157
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,480
Don't waste the registration.

158
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,020
Registration fee.

159
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800
How much is that?

160
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
How much?

161
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,600
That's a lot of money.

162
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,610
I'll take the money.

163
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I won't return it.

164
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,160
Deal.

165
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,280
I won't go back on my word.

166
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
I won't let you go.

167
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,930
Goodbye.

168
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,840
Bye.

169
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,160
Brother Xu, you're so nice.

170
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,720
Who is it?

171
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,040
You're early.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,060
Where is Hua Xiaoqiao?

173
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,060
Hua Xiao Zheng.

174
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Honey.

175
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,660
Brother! Brother!

176
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,600
Honey.

177
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,600
Sit.

178
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
Honey.

179
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,130
I’m the chairman of Anle Chamber of Commerce.

180
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,320
Excuse me.

181
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Who is he?

182
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,090
Chief of the Carp Alliance.

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Mr. Zhang.

184
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Yes, I am.

185
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,600
Director Zhang,

186
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,680
why are you here?

187
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,320
I drove my wife

188
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
pissed off.

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Brother Xu is comforting me.

190
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,040
Brother Xu is a good man.

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,320
He's not like the rumors.

192
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,960
What King of Hell?

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Nonsense.

194
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,680
Ziqi.

195
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
Who is his wife?

196
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,600
Hua Xiao Zheng.

197
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,020
Hua Xiao Zheng is his wife.

198
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,320
When did she get married?

199
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,720
She...

200
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Why did she get married?

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,400
She's not married yet.

202
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,080
He proposed and didn't agree.

203
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,080
He pissed Hua Xiao Zheng off.

204
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,400
He will marry him.

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
I will.

206
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,340
Master Zhang, how do you know you will marry him?

207
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,960
Hua Xiao Zheng and I...

208
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,040
It's the order of parents and matchmakers.

209
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,280
It’s natural.

210
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,840
Leader Zhang,

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,480
I have to tell you

212
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,440
about the marriage law of Tang.

213
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
The words of matchmakers

214
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,160
only verbal promises are useless.

215
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
It has to be written

216
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,080
clearly.

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
What is this?

218
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
It's upside down.

219
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,920
Zhang Jiagui has been friendly with the Hua family for generations.

220
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,800
Both parties voluntarily and their parents agreed

221
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
and their parents' consent.

222
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,040
Tie the red rope tightly.

223
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,680
Is it legal?

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,280
It can't be legal anymore.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,680
Yes.

226
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,080
If Hua Xiao Zheng doesn't marry him,

227
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,680
she will be sentenced to

228
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,080
run away from marriage.

229
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Brother.

230
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,840
How can I sue my wife?

231
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,200
Am I right?

232
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,840
As a man,

233
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,800
Director Zhang,

234
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,420
I have something to do.

235
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,560
Excuse me.

236
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Li.

237
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,200
Go ahead.

238
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Aren't you going to have another drink?

239
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,160
I'll come back later.

240
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,440
Come back.

241
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,320
Okay.

242
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,160
Brother.

243
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,440
Keep drinking.

244
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,920
Zhang Gui has checked

245
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,080
Are you...

246
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,200
A good person?

247
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,680
When?

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,200
Now

249
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,320
Now

250
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Calm down, my lord.

251
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
He just said

252
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,960
he's the leader of the Carp Alliance.

253
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
There are so many people here.

254
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,080
We should grow up.

255
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,440
I also think it's not a good thing.

256
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,200
But...

257
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,040
I can't beat him.

258
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
Is it good?

259
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
I can't beat him.

260
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,490
Let's think of another way.

261
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
What is it?

262
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,280
Kill him!

263
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
My lord. My lord.

264
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Let's...

265
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,040
Don't pull me.

266
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,900
Think about it.

267
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
I'll tell you if you can't drink.

268
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,480
I'll help you today.

269
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,480
I've arranged the registration for you.

270
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,600
It's very clear in the register.

271
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,960
You can go to the scene and confirm it now.

272
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,840
The deadline is tomorrow.

273
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,010
How to choose the Oiran?

274
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,800
I need to be good at everything.

275
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,080
What else do you think?

276
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

277
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,040
Why didn't I tell you earlier?

278
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,100
I thought you knew.

279
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,840
You don't know? Why are you here?

280
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,080
Do I look like I know it?

281
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,560
You have to work hard.

282
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Why?

283
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,600
The Oiran Exam.

284
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,560
I don't know how to do it.

285
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,560
Registration fee is so expensive.

286
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Don't give up.

287
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,440
Work hard.

288
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,200
Well...

289
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Well...

290
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,320
Can I return the application fee?

291
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Bye.

292
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,800
I...

293
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,400
My application fee.

294
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,800
I've never seen

295
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,800
I've never seen such a proper marriage letter.

296
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,720
There's really no flaw.

297
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Strict stitches.

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,960
and tight.

299
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,480
I thought

300
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
Hua Xiao Zheng is

301
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
who has no family.

302
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:23,960
Yes.

303
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
I've been in this industry for so many years.

304
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,160
Who would have thought...

305
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,840
he was the number one gangster in Tang.

306
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,090
I don't know where he is now.

307
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,680
Is he still in Chang'an?

308
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,080
What are you looking for?

309
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,610
She's Jang Gui-jae's wife.

310
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
What are we doing?

311
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,440
Don't worry about it.

312
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,960
But didn't you say

313
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,320
she would rather die than obey?

314
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Is that something she never obeys?

315
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,800
Even if Hua Xiao Zheng doesn't obey,

316
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
the Tang Code will let her...

317
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,480
From now on,

318
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,560
all her problems

319
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,200
to find Zhang Gui.

320
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
I won't interfere anymore.

321
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,080
My lord.

322
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
This is the list of the Oiran selection this year.

323
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,260
Please have a look.

324
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,800
Yes.

325
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,180
This...

326
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,480
In order not to marry Zhang Gui Cai,

327
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,500
to not marry Zhang Gui Cai.

328
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,080
She's really something.

329
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,100
Isn't she forcing me into prostitution?

330
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,480
Li.

331
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,730
Let's go.

332
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Find someone.

333
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,960
Don't do this.

334
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,960
This is mine.

335
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,490
Okay, thank you.

336
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,440
This is mine.

337
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,800
You danced so well.

338
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,200
Okay.

339
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,040
Okay.

340
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,520
It's so hard to be the Oiran.

341
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,880
Alright.

342
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,880
Please tell me the basic information again.

343
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,600
Height 5.6 inches.

344
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Weight 105.

345
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,960
Learning dancing at three.

346
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,440
I learned pipa at four.

347
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,600
Learning at five

348
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
I learned flutes at six.

349
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,720
I was seven years old. I learned flowers, tea, chess, calligraphy and painting.

350
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,960
You can make Flying Flower Token at eight.

351
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,490
When I was nine, my qin skills shook Chang'an.

352
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,440
When I was ten, I danced and met you two.

353
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,920
Now you're good at dancing and playing.

354
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,200
in Chang'an.

355
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
The Oiran

356
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
It's been three years. It's been three years. It's been a while. It's been a while. It's been a while.

357
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
Amazing.

358
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,370
The light of all women in Chang'an.

359
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,920
Amazing.

360
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,040
You are the queen.

361
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,600
Be confident and shine.

362
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Miss.

363
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,920
Miss.

364
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Who are you?

365
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm here to cancel the application fee.

366
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,680
I knew it.

367
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
Look at your small arms and legs.

368
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,680
to run for the Oiran.

369
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,090
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

370
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
What's your name?

371
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
Hua Xiaochi

372
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,960
Hua Xiaotong.

373
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,200
Cancel the Oiran.

374
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
and pay ten times the penalty.

375
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,440
A total of 1,000 taels of silver.

376
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,370
Pay at the scene.

377
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,760
1,000 taels.

378
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,520
It costs 1,000 taels to cancel the registration.

379
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,320
That's right.

380
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,840
Excuse me.

381
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,680
I want to cry.

382
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,440
But I can't.

383
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,200
Is this the feeling of crying without tears?

384
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,440
The idioms are so wonderful.

385
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,520
Come with us.

386
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,240
Why are you leaving?

387
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,840
Cancel the application now.

388
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes, cancel it now.

389
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,200
I can't.

390
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
Even if you don't become the Oiran,

391
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
you don't have to marry Bachelor Zhang.

392
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,360
Yes.

393
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,280
Why didn't you tell me

394
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,700
Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,120
He didn't come to me.

396
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,200
I forgot about the candidate.

397
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,960
Candidate?

398
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,840
I don't want to be the Oiran anymore.

399
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,120
Please help me. Cancel it for me.

400
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,200
Then cancel it.

401
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,840
Cancel it!

402
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,480
1,000 taels of silver for breach of contract.

403
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,410
I'll pay for you.

404
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,120
Mr. Bang and Mr. Xu are loyal.

405
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
Since you don't want to be the Oiran,

406
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,020
why did you sign up?

407
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,370
You reminded me.

408
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,120
I'm going to find that evil woman, Ms. Seol.

409
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,540
I'll get going.

410
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,200
My goodness.

411
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,760
Are you buying flowers?

412
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,890
My ancestor.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,530
I have something to ask you.

414
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,480
The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, the wine in the cup

415
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
Dream man?

416
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,960
No, I want to ask you something.

417
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,440
Except the 16 words

418
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,120
you said last time,

419
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,960
other than the 16 words you said?

420
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,970
Watching flowers in the fog

421
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,960
Horses and flowers

422
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm confused.

423
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
The iron tree blooms

424
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,880
"Look at you." It's "Look at you."

425
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,600
I want to say

426
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,730
if there are flowers, it can be broken.

427
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
Don't wait until the flowers fall apart.

428
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,960
I'm looking for a husband, not a flower.

429
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,760
What?

430
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,920
Flower.

431
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
[Flower]

432
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,240
You mean

433
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,760
to run for the Oiran?

434
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,250
Where is she?

435
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,600
The Oiran.

436
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,450
I’ll take 1,000 taels of silver

437
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,480
to the Chamber of Commerce tomorrow.

438
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,140
I don’t need you to come again.

439
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,960
I've been really shy lately.

440
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,680
But it’s not appropriate

441
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
to let you pay so much.

442
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
It's not for free.

443
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,120
I'll send her back to the mansion.

444
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,440
and pay the debt for the rest of her life.

445
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,520
Then...

446
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
I'll pay half.

447
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,440
Let this scourge

448
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
to haunt you forever.

449
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,210
It's killing me.

450
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,880
If you ask me,

451
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,960
if you want to give this money to that scoundrel,

452
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,360
she will write down the IOU

453
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,440
and write down how much she owes.

454
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,020
How much should I pay back with interest?

455
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,680
Otherwise, what should she do

456
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
what should we do?

457
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,840
Pay your debt.

458
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
and marry you.

459
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,880
You'll be rewarded. You'll be rewarded.

460
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,240
Yes.

461
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,960
We can use this to keep Hua

462
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Husppy is a genius

463
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,000
What do you think?

464
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,720
Sure.

465
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Let’s go home and withdraw the money.

466
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,050
We’ll meet at Pingkang Fang at 7 tomorrow.

467
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Good.

468
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,200
It's natural

469
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,360
It's natural.

470
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,360
My lord.

471
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,500
I'm not asking her to sell herself to pay back the money.

472
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,210
What's going on?

473
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,160
I got bitten by a dog.

474
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,920
But with the determination to run for the Oiran,

475
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,160
to fight the fierce dog.

476
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,760
I finally got the application form back.

477
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,740
Didn't you say you'd quit yesterday?

478
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,280
I realized it overnight.

479
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,680
Famous prostitute is a good job.

480
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,720
She has a bright future.

481
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,960
The Oiran

482
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,680
is indeed a good job.

483
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,040
But you're basically a runner.

484
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,400
It's okay.

485
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,680
Young people should run and fight.

486
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,960
Dreams are what they pursue.

487
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,200
There's hope when there's a pursuit.

488
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,240
Hua Xiaochi, what are you doing?

489
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,020
Hua Xiao Zheng.

490
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,720
Did you say

491
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,040
to spend 1,000 taels of silver

492
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,160
to cancel the competition for the Oiran.

493
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,760
Why did you go back on your word?

494
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,220
Are you talking nonsense?

495
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,720
Ziqi

496
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,400
Zheng.

497
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,000
Do you know what the Oiran competition is about?

498
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,240
Music, chess, calligraphy and painting.

499
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
[Poems and poems, poems, and poems.] [Poems]

500
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I can learn

501
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
I can learn.

502
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,680
I can learn without eating or drinking.

503
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,200
At least I tried.

504
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,880
instead of giving up now.

505
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,440
Other than these skills,

506
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,960
they also have great wealth.

507
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,420
The Oiran competition is about popularity.

508
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,360
In terms of popularity,

509
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,920
you can't beat Gu Jin'er.

510
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,450
You need money to choose the Oiran.

511
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,640
Could it be...

512
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,170
The prices in Chang'an are rising and the people are suffering.

513
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,360
Someone in the court

514
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,240
joint hands with the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of Commerce.

515
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,520
This matter has sent many spies to investigate for years.

516
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,920
but only found out that the mastermind is a relative of the royal family.

517
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,520
Li,

518
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,960
So Gu Jin'er has spent a lot of money

519
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,280
the Chamber of Commerce must have spent a lot of money.

520
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
Anyway, you can't afford so much money.

521
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,480
And it's not easy to be the Oiran.

522
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,760
Then tell me.

523
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,170
How much do you need?

524
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,740
It doesn't matter.

525
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,880
As long as it's what my wife wants to do,

526
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,960
I can afford any price.

527
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,400
Xiao Zheng.

528
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,640
Brother.

529
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,160
Don't you go slower

530
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
It's flashing.

531
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,200
Madam is worried about me.

532
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,730
Brother.

533
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,920
Sit down.

534
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,800
Slow down.

535
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,600
Brother.

536
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,060
You're talking nonsense.

537
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,220
Don't blame me for beating you up.

538
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,680
Zheng,

539
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,960
Are you sure you want to run for the Oiran?

540
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,360
To win the Oiran?

541
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,040
Good.

542
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,440
Even if I have to go bankrupt,

543
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
to fulfill your wish.

544
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,520
Why?

545
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
We've only met

546
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,600
three times.

547
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,440
The first time we got married.

548
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,380
The second time is a proposal.

549
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,700
For the third time,

550
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,090
Even if I have to do everything for you,

551
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,960
it's reasonable.

552
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,240
But why?

553
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,720
Didn't you hear what Fang said?

554
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
I need a lot of money.

555
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,360
Yuanhan.

556
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,210
Yes. Yes.

557
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,400
Pass my order.

558
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,160
Tell the nearest helm to prepare 10,000 taels of gold.

559
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,960
If it’s not enough, ask other branches to prepare.

560
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,120
Yes.

561
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

562
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,960
That much?

563
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,400
Excuse me.

564
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,730
Let's go.

565
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,200
I can't take your money.

566
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,680
If I take it, it means I'll marry you.

567
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,880
It doesn't matter.

568
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
As long as you're happy,

569
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,240
your dream is my dream.

570
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,200
Your pursuit is my pursuit.

571
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,360
Thank you.

572
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,000
Kill him right now!

573
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,290
Kill him if it doesn't work.

574
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,450
Your Excellency, in order to find Hua Xiao Zheng,

575
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
sent 1,000 members of the Carp Alliance to Chang'an.

576
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,200
He has booked all the taverns.

577
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,720
If we do it now,

578
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
we'll catch a turtle in a jar.

579
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,540
My lord, what's wrong?

580
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,020
My chest is stuffy.

581
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,680
It's so stuffy.

582
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,540
Brother Zhang.

583
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
How much did she spend in the Oiran Competition?

584
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,040
Shouldn't she write it down?

585
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,640
From the principal to the interest,

586
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,160
You must remember it clearly.

587
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,440
I'll pay you back.

588
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm fine.

589
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,280
We're family.

590
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,940
What's there to remember?

591
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Besides, she owes me a lot. Marry me.

592
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,380
Hua Xiao Zheng.

593
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,360
Don't you want a receipt?

594
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,840
10,000 taels of gold.

595
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,280
What if I can't pay you back?

596
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,740
Hua Xiao Zheng.

597
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
Sooner or later,

598
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
on money one day.

599
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,440
Someone will support me.

600
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Why are you angry?

601
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,440
I...

602
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,420
I don't want to talk to you.

603
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,440
Brother Xu.

604
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,240
Goodbye.

605
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,780
Leave him alone

606
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,680
Lord Li of the Ministry of Revenue donated 100,000 taels

607
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Total 10,000 taels of gold

608
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,360
Governor Zhao of Ministry of Rites donated 100,000 votes

609
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Total of gold

610
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,640
10,000 taels.

611
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,360
Mr. Zhang of the Ministry of Personnel donated 100,000 votes.

612
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,160
Stop reading. It's such a long list.

613
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,240
The tea will be cold after you finish.

614
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,440
Give a copy to Lord Wu.

615
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Jin'er won over 80,000 votes last year.

616
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
We don't have to go too far this year.

617
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,900
100,000 votes are enough.

618
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,360
The rest of the tickets

619
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,880
to Lord Wu.

620
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,280
Yes.

621
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,240
Did anything happen

622
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
did anything wrong?

623
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,770
They are all our people.

624
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,360
There are 31 people in total.

625
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,840
We have arranged 30 candidates.

626
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,740
Except one person.

627
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Who is it?

628
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,200
A woman from a farmhouse slave.

629
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,680
Hua Xiaochi

630
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,200
Hua Xiao Zheng.

631
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,440
A slave from a farm

632
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,000
won't be a big deal.

633
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,460
I'm afraid she wants to be famous.

634
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Let her be.

635
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,440
The power behind her

636
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,720
is the Lucky Carp Alliance.

637
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
Please calm down.

638
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,160
The person recommended by the Koi Alliance

639
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,360
If you ruin the election,

640
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll see how you'll compensate.

641
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,060
Calm down, my lord.

642
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
What's wrong with the Koi Alliance?

643
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,800
Does the Koi Alliance dare to fight with court officials?

644
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,240
We don't know

645
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,250
who will help in the end.

646
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,540
Keep an eye on the girl from the Lucky Carp Alliance.

647
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,240
Don't make any mistakes.

648
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,640
Yes.

649
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,120
The charity show tomorrow is ready.

650
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,580
Gu Jin'er will be there on time to distribute porridge.

651
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,330
Hold the heart of the people that should be taken.

652
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,440
Go back.

653
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,980
Thank you, my lord.

654
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,160
Hero, how is it?

655
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,200
It'll start in an hour.

656
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,440
Hurry up.

657
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,600
I can't control my hand.

658
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,040
If only there was a wooden shelf

659
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
can be fixed.

660
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,200
Hero, don't worry.

661
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,240
Let's try again.

662
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,840
Get ready.

663
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,680
The physicians are also preparing.

664
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,400
Hurry up.

665
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,120
I'm afraid it won't work.

666
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,520
The fear of a hero

667
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,400
for some time.

668
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,680
Today,

669
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
can't help me put on makeup.

670
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
Let's try again.

671
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
Let the performers

672
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,920
Now go to the porridge shop

673
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,000
Wear the most beautiful clothes

674
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,680
and dance the most familiar dance.

675
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,160
This dance doesn't need to be so lively.

676
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,960
But we must be warm and sincere.

677
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,920
and ask them to bring more copper coins to spend money.

678
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,480
But to stabilize the people in your name,

679
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,880
We call it

680
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,680
to the public.

681
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,290
Jin'er is not feeling well.

682
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,680
but I care about the people.

683
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,720
He's willing to give out all he has to give porridge and food.

684
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,720
Everything

685
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,440
Mom.

686
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,920
What? You don't want to leave?

687
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Are you stupid?

688
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,199
If you were the Oiran again,

689
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,679
the money

690
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,400
can be saved.

691
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,600
If you can't pass the first test,

692
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,260
what will you do in the future?

693
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,239
That's right.

694
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,760
Huan, hurry up.

695
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,840
Come with me to get the money.

696
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,520
Hurry up.

697
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,440
How is he?

698
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,120
Hero, we still have some time.

699
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,280
Try again.

700
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,840
Come on, okay?

701
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,400
Sir.

702
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,400
Have a rest.

703
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,980
Young Master Ying.

704
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,639
My lord.

705
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,400
Say it.

706
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Someone reported

707
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,980
Miss Xiao is organizing a gathering.

708
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,239
The location is

709
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,840
Turn to the north.

710
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,040
You can get off the sedan and take a look.

711
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,560
Turn north ahead

712
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,600
Isn't it a fireworks lane?

713
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,280
Yes.

714
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,720
It's very lively.

715
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,740
The most popular fireworks lane.

716
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Hello, everyone.

717
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm Hua Xiaochi.

718
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,560
A few days ago,

719
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,120
a few days ago.

720
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,560
Go down.

721
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,960
Come down.

722
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Today,

723
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
I want to sincerely

724
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,960
to all the people in Chang'an.

725
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,840
I'm sorry.

726
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,500
Does apology work?

727
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,400
Go down.

728
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,000
Go down.

729
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,520
Shame on you.

730
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,080
Get down.

731
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,440
In the place I live,

732
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,960
In order to achieve my goal,

733
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,720
he would do something

734
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,640
and even hurt others.

735
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,500
Before I came to Chang'an,

736
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,100
before I came to Chang'an.

737
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,960
I think a person should

738
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,640
live for himself.

739
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,050
you should never give up until you achieve your goal.

740
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,720
In our place,

741
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,440
This is called a competition.

742
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
What?

743
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,880
Your trick

744
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,360
to win people's support.

745
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,320
Does it work?

746
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,520
You saw it.

747
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,240
These people are yelling to beat her up.

748
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,060
Screaming.

749
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,240
I'll be beaten to death

750
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
What should we do?

751
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,960
That's why

752
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,880
Xiao Zheng asked us to wait here.

753
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,800
If someone hits her later,

754
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
you can go ahead

755
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,640
to everyone.

756
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,800
Pretend to beat her up

757
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,620
and tell her to get rid of the evil for the people.

758
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,970
Your wife is quite cunning.

759
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,480
Acting without real things.

760
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,280
You know how to do this?

761
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,440
Got it.

762
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,920
What?

763
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,600
Apologize in public.

764
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,850
That's right, boss.

765
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,040
Apologize on the street in the fireworks alley.

766
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,240
and repeat

767
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
what I did wrong.

768
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,280
Your attitude of admitting your mistake is quite sincere.

769
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,740
Some people say it's okay.

770
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,440
Some want to beat her up.

771
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,440
Hit her.

772
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,600
Let's go! Let's go!

773
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,640
Don't worry.

774
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,640
Don't worry.

775
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,760
She's a girl.

776
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,480
No one can do it.

777
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,480
After I came to Chang'an,

778
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I started to think

779
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,360
The vicious competition

780
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,960
and make people use of each other.

781
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,160
making people lose trust.

782
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,540
Without true friends,

783
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,960
we become more hostile.

784
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,800
Everyday, we fight endlessly

785
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,700
What I do is getting more and more unreasonable.

786
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,960
You don't even care about others' feelings.

787
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,760
Go down.

788
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,920
Go down.

789
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,560
Get down.

790
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,560
I really

791
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,480
deserve

792
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,580
to be respected by anyone.

793
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,960
What?

794
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,920
I used to yearn for fame and fortune.

795
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,600
But now I'm really scared.

796
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
In the future,

797
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,120
If only fame and profit

798
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,840
how cold would it be?

799
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
That's why I stopped making excuses

800
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,640
saying that there's no way out in Chang'an.

801
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,040
I had no choice but to do bad things.

802
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,120
How can there be so many things that can't be forced?

803
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,080
I'm just too selfish.

804
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
That makes sense.

805
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,480
What she said is quite pitiful.

806
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,920
She's reflecting on herself.

807
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,480
Go down.

808
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,400
Go down.

809
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,400
Maybe

810
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,920
I can't be a good person.

811
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,440
But I will try not to be a bad person.

812
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
I'll try my best

813
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm really

814
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,000
really sorry.

815
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,560
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,520
Get down.

817
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,960
No way.

818
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,700
Do I deserve a beating?

819
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,640
Get down.

820
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,760
Go down.

821
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,760
Get down.

822
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,000
Come down.

823
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,480
Go!

824
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,480
Get down. Get down.

825
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,720
Hit her.

826
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,400
Yes.

827
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,600
Hit her.

828
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,000
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her!

829
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,120
Hit her!

830
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,800
Hit her.

831
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,520
Hit her!

832
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,600
You'll die a horrible death.

833
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,040
Beat her! Beat her!

834
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,400
Hit her.

835
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Hit her!

836
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,040
Beat her up!

837
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,520
Zheng!

838
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,360
Beat her up!

839
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,480
I'm the king of hell.

840
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,610
Who dares to do this?

841
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,440
Beat her!

842
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,160
I...

843
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:12,960
Beat her.

844
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,840
Xu Ziqi!

845
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,440
Beat her!

846
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,160
Separate hatred.

847
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,280
Hit her!

848
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,800
Xu Ziqi!

849
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,440
Why are you here?

850
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,600
Why are you so violent?

851
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,880
Sit down and talk.

852
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,800
Let's go!

853
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,250
Hit her! Hit her!

854
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,440
Boss Xu.

855
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,600
Zheng!

856
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,080
Hit her!

857
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,160
Aren't you going to hit Xiao Zheng?

858
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,320
Why did you hit me?

859
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,850
Chief Xu.

860
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,360
Stop!

861
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,720
Beat her!

862
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,280
Ziqi

863
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,440
Ziqi!

864
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:38,970
Beat her!

865
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,960
Ziqi

866
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,600
Ziqi.

867
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,920
Brother Xu, you misunderstood.

868
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,080
My brothers

869
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,400
to protect Zheng.

870
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
But I didn't expect

871
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
You're making Brother Xu all wet.

872
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,760
Khagan.

873
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,820
It doesn't matter.

874
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,220
But Hua Xiao Zheng,

875
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,440
What are you doing?

876
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,520
I apologize.

877
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,280
Didn't you hear what the separation said?

878
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,410
Famous prostitute needs popularity.

879
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,680
I'm being boycotted by all the people in Chang'an.

880
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,160
How can I be popular?

881
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,360
So I thought

882
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,880
I should apologize to you sincerely.

883
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,520
Maybe we can get rid of some resentment.

884
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,080
Who knows?

885
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
As you can see,

886
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,880
how can the resentment

887
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,520
can't be erased so easily.

888
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,040
Boss!

889
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,360
Brother!

890
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,960
What's wrong?

891
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,840
Good news.

892
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,520
She's already in the top ten.

893
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,000
Really?

894
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,960
Really

895
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,560
Everyone is praising her for being brave and responsible.

896
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,240
Yes.

897
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,600
Yes.

898
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,360
Anyway, the voting is very active.

899
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,880
That scene was popular.

900
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,720
It was so loud and crowded.

901
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,720
Good.

902
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,040
If you are sincere, it will work.

903
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,840
Voting is a big game.

904
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,600
OK.

905
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,280
Xu Ziqi.

906
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,160
Why are you still looking at me like that?

907
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,440
I did it.

908
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,360
Who's looking at you?

909
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,360
I hurt my neck just now.

910
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,560
It's not convenient to turn.

911
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,570
Who wants to see you?

912
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,260
Brother Xu sprained his neck.

913
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,920
No need.

914
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,920
No need.

915
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,720
Boss.

916
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,440
There's a new notice on the notice board.

917
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,240
The first round of the Oiran competition

918
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,040
is out.

919
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,640
Okay.

920
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,400
Let's start.

921
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,560
This...

922
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,480
Brother Xu, don't you need my help?

923
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,280
My brother is living a good life.

924
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,850
I'm leaving too.

925
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Come, take a seat.

926
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,170
What else did he say?

927
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,760
She said

928
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,660
your wife can change her past.

929
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,160
Everyone thinks it's great.

930
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,290
They all support us.

931
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,320
OK.

932
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Great. It's just a competition.

933
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,080
Visual.

934
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,440
Pick eyes.

935
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,560
It's not hard.

936
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,000
Believe in yourself.

937
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,180
and chase bravely.

938
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,960
There's another line.

939
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
Double dance.

940
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,280
Who is the best dancer in Chang'an?

941
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,720
The man who said the best dancer in Chang'an

942
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,480
is you.

943
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,880
Say it.

944
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,000
Say something, Xu Ziqi.
