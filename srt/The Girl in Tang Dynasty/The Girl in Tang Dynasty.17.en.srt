1
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
Hua Xiaofei not becoming the courtesan

2
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
suits our intentions perfectly.

3
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800
Go find Gu Jin'er

4
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,290
and everything will return to normal.

5
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,380
So the officials in the palace can rest assured.

6
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,890
I'll take care of it right away.

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,200
Why aren't you protecting Hua Xiaofei anymore?

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,579
After spending these days together,

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,520
I deeply feel Hua Xiaofei is unsuitable for the guild's affairs.

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
You have

11
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,620
developed real feelings for her.

12
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,640
But you two are worlds apart.

13
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,140
I fear she's clouding your judgment,

14
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,040
making you forget what you should do,

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
what you can do,

16
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,960
and what you must do.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Elder Yi.

18
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
Once a merchant,

19
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,700
forever despised?

20
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I am the head of the four elders of the Tang Guild

21
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
and the leader of all merchants in the Great Tang.

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Yet I still cannot choose my own path.

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,560
If this is my fate, what about yours?

24
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,080
Fang Lihen.

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,200
My parents are both dead.

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,240
I no longer hope for marriage,

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
being alone

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,840
with no attachments.

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,300
But you're different.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,660
I can no longer escape my merchant status

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,920
and must serve Master Wu for the rest of my life.

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,050
But you still have choices.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
You have a path ahead,

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,120
family to find,

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,079
and someone you care for.

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
Don't hesitate anymore.

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,700
Otherwise,

38
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,170
I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you completely.

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Elder Yi,

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,890
why have you always taken such good care of me?

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,960
Because...

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,680
because you were chosen by our guild.

43
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,400
If I had to find someone new,

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
I fear I wouldn't have the strength.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,240
So don't make any more mistakes.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
Our lives

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
cannot afford many mistakes.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,140
I understand, sir.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,960
You may go.

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,810
I left in such a hurry

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,980
I forgot to bring my family's miraculous medicine.

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,440
Miss Yang.

53
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,540
I apologize for my intrusion.

54
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Hello, Miss Yang.

55
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
I heard today

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,320
that you left the Fang residence early this morning.

57
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
I wanted to

58
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,960
see if you had really gone.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm leaving right away.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
You are indeed strong, sir.

61
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Those royal torture devices

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,210
and you've recovered in less than three days.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
What are you talking about?

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,580
Please don't hide it, sir.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,880
I applied medicine to your wounds.

66
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,320
I saw your injuries very clearly.

67
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
There's a course at the Imperial Academy

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
that only students who excel for five consecutive years

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,580
are qualified to take.

70
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,409
This course is called 'The Art of Espionage.'

71
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
Several lessons

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,560
cover these unique torture devices.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,600
The marks from these devices

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,080
match exactly with the wounds on your body.

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,080
Miss Yang, I think you've read

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,080
too many books and made yourself foolish.

77
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
How could you believe such nonsense?

78
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,240
If you deny it,

79
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,200
I'll go outside and tell everyone about it.

80
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,320
That the Tang Dynasty's number one bailiff

81
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
is actually a royal spy.

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,130
Then you'll know whether it's true or not.

83
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
Don't talk nonsense.

84
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't cause trouble for the court.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,260
Everyone is very busy.

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,500
If you agree to my one condition, sir,

87
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,960
I'll keep this matter completely secret.

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,360
Don't push it.

89
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
Just agree to go on an outing with me alone, sir.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,080
How long would this outing be?

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
12 hours.

92
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
One incense stick.

93
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
6 hours.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,560
1 hour.

95
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
2 hours.

96
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,760
Deal. Now leave.

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
I will arrange a time with you in advance

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,860
and hope you won't stand me up.

99
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
Through wind and rain,

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,210
I'll be waiting for you.

101
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Xu Ziqi.

102
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
You!

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Hello, Miss Xiaofei.

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,240
Steward Yang, isn't your injury

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,960
almost healed by now?

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,320
Why aren't you back at the Imperial Academy?

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,850
What are you two doing here?

108
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,320
I invited Mr. Xu for a private outing.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,880
So Mr. Xu has agreed?

110
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,240
He agreed. Very promptly agreed.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How prompt.

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
Not that promptly.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,440
It was quite prompt.

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,680
It really wasn't prompt.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Why did you agree if you weren't willing?

116
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,200
I...

117
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,080
So he agreed promptly.

118
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,320
You agreed but weren't willing?

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,080
Fine, fine, fine.

120
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,540
Very prompt, very prompt.

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
Xu Ziqi,

122
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,720
you've got guts.

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
What?

124
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,200
So you're allowed to like rich people,

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
why can't I like rich people too?

126
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Did I go too far with what I said?

127
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,080
Sir,

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,930
please forgive me for not being able to accept your request.

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,720
Why not?

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,940
These days when I'm not being a courtesan

131
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
are the happiest

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,440
and most free days of my life.

133
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,820
I don't have to fake my smiles.

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
I don't have to please others

135
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,020
by singing songs I don't want to sing.

136
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Now,

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm finally free from being controlled by others.

138
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
Please understand, sir.

139
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
If you don't continue being the courtesan,

140
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,600
how will you support such huge daily expenses?

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,290
I've saved some money of my own.

142
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,680
Although

143
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,960
it's certainly not as comfortable as my previous life,

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,800
I now

145
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,900
can finally live according to my own wishes.

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,890
All that past suffering

147
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
wasn't it all for this very day?

148
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,920
Are you really

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,410
unwilling to come back?

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,440
I am certain.

151
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,280
Fine. I won't force you.

152
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,440
Sir.

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,460
Take care of yourself.

154
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
This is so dirty.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,080
Yingxiong.

156
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,720
Come in.

157
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,280
Once registered as a merchant, it's the lowest social status.

158
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,410
Only an imperial decree can change it.

159
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,840
Miss, are you sure?

160
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm sure.

161
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,090
Alright.

162
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,420
Then I'll make the change.

163
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,560
Wait, wait.

164
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,720
What's wrong?

165
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,960
This is one of the most

166
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,680
important

167
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
events in my life.

168
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,960
Can I write it myself?

169
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,560
No.

170
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,800
Brother, please try a little.

171
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
Maybe it's possible.

172
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,200
Even if I try, it's not allowed.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,280
Please.

174
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,620
Stop wasting time.

175
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,680
Please.

176
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,960
Official Xu.

177
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240
It's such a small matter.

178
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
Just let her write it herself.

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Otherwise people might say

180
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,440
you're abusing your power.

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,800
Yes, yes.

182
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
Official Xu is right.

183
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,800
I feel like my life from now on

184
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,810
will be completely different.

185
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,920
Don't think that just because you helped me this time

186
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,160
I'll forgive you.

187
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,490
Who cares about your forgiveness?

188
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,840
Besides, I didn't do anything wrong,

189
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,680
you vain woman.

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Our Jin'er

191
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,080
actually refused to compete for the title of flower queen,

192
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,320
even though Chairman Fang personally came to invite you,

193
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,050
and you rejected him so firmly.

194
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
After these few days,

195
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
I really don't want to go back to

196
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,060
those humiliating and filthy days anymore.

197
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,280
Jin'er,

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,160
I need to tell you something,

199
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,490
but you can't get angry.

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,960
During the flower queen competition a few days ago,

201
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,080
I was making wishes every day.

202
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,080
And then?

203
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,060
I wasn't wishing for you to become the flower queen.

204
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
I was wishing that our Jin'er

205
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,320
could leave this awful place soon

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,850
and live the life she wants.

207
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,200
But now seeing you so happy,

208
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
I feel like my wish has come true.

209
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,840
Yes,

210
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,580
heaven has answered our prayers.

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,680
The luckiest thing in my life, Gu Jin'er,

212
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,680
was six years ago

213
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,960
on that snow-covered road

214
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
when I picked you up.

215
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
Me too.

216
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,960
My greatest luck was that out of all places,

217
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,730
I collapsed on your way back to Pingkang Ward.

218
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,560
Jin'er,

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
I ran through more than ten streets

220
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
to buy your favorite cherry biluo dessert,

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,810
and it's still cold.

222
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,080
But I only bought two portions.

223
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,600
You and Yingxiong can share them.

224
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,960
I'll be going now.

225
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,680
Sit down and eat with us.

226
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,280
Sit.

227
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,210
Yingxiong doesn't like sweet things.

228
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
I like them too.

229
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,320
No, you don't.

230
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
Drink slowly.

231
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,460
You'll burn yourself.

232
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
Jin'er,

233
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,810
would you sell these cups to me?

234
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Why?

235
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:47,960
Because

236
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,560
this cup

237
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,960
is the one you used to pour tea for me the first time.

238
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,040
I need to keep it safe.

239
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,960
From now on,

240
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,530
you can come have tea with me every day.

241
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,400
Every day?

242
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,560
Every day?

243
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,480
Jin'er, I promise you

244
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,920
I'll come see you every day from now on.

245
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,800
Whether it's windy or rainy,

246
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
whatever you want to eat,

247
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
no matter how far,

248
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll buy it for you.

249
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,080
If it's not available anywhere,

250
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,610
I'll make it for you myself.

251
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
Anything you like,

252
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,050
I'm willing to give you.

253
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,330
Please sit down.

254
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,940
Eat up. Have some more.

255
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,320
This is

256
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,200
that lonely feeling again.

257
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,920
Why?

258
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,480
I suddenly realize everyone around me

259
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,040
has found a new path.

260
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
Only I

261
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,440
remain where I was.

262
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
Oh my God!

263
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,130
Why is starting a business so expensive everywhere?

264
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,480
67 taels.

265
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,720
Miss, here's your energizing matcha tea.

266
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,849
Two taels of silver.

267
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,760
Wait a minute.

268
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
I suddenly have an emergency.

269
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,000
Could you cancel this for me?

270
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,859
I have to go now.

271
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,760
Please cancel it for me. Thanks.

272
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,040
But my tea...

273
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,200
Respected friends,

274
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
dear distinguished guests,

275
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,680
good morning to you all.

276
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,840
I am Hua Xiaofei,

277
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,240
twenty years old,

278
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
from the beautiful peony hometown of Huajia Village.

279
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm good at gardening, makeup, and business.

280
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,360
Though I'm just a humble woman,

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,200
I'm the one who developed this Noble Street.

282
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,640
Well done!

283
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Excellent!

284
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm being modest.

285
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,360
I'm planning to create my own beauty brand.

286
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,240
Make a fortune.

287
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,240
But just before opening,

288
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,000
I suddenly realized something.

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,440
If it weren't for everyone's help in the past,

290
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,760
how could I be so successful today?

291
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,050
So I've decided,

292
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,520
joy shared is joy doubled.

293
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,400
I want everyone to be involved.

294
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,010
Everyone can participate.

295
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,840
Right.

296
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
It means working together.

297
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
This business concept

298
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,840
is called partnership.

299
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,840
Partnership?

300
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,740
What is a partnership?

301
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,840
Joint investment means everyone contributes a portion,

302
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,000
whether it's one string of coins

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,200
or one tael of silver.

304
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,000
Then,

305
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,480
it's converted into corresponding investment certificates,

306
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,640
or stocks.

307
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,120
In return,

308
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
I will distribute dividends

309
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
to each investor

310
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,450
according to their contribution.

311
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,480
I absolutely won't let anyone's money go to waste.

312
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,520
Can anyone buy your stocks?

313
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,520
But considering the potential risks.

314
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,040
This time,

315
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
we're limiting purchases to

316
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,600
one tael of silver as the maximum investment.

317
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,440
Only 100 shares are available in total.

318
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,140
First come, first served.

319
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,680
Don't miss this opportunity.

320
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,140
First come, first served,

321
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,970
we need to hurry.

322
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,280
If all ladies present believe in me

323
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,160
and trust me,

324
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,840
please boldly raise your hands

325
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,680
to purchase these valuable shares.

326
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,040
With your vote and my vote,

327
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,880
Xiaofei will debut tomorrow.

328
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,880
If you don't invest and I don't invest...

329
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,360
When will Xiaofei ever succeed?

330
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,360
Let's try.

331
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,520
We need to help her.

332
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:34,960
Yes, indeed.

333
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,440
It's just a tael of silver.

334
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,360
Just for fun. I'll invest.

335
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
Hua Xiaofei.

336
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,040
You!

337
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,920
You stinking girl!

338
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,240
I've been sick of you for a long time.

339
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,240
If you're not going to be a courtesan anymore, get the hell away from me.

340
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
Stop doing these shameless things.

341
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
How dare you go against the Chamber of Commerce!

342
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll beat you to death right here in the street, you worthless trash.

343
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,730
Let's see who dares stop me.

344
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,020
What are you doing?

345
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,280
What's going on here?

346
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
Why are you being so violent?

347
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
I've done nothing wrong.

348
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,920
It's you people from the Chamber of Commerce who are wrong.

349
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,440
It's because of people like you

350
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,240
who don't treat others as human beings.

351
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,840
You're the worthless trash.

352
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,200
I'll kill you.

353
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,600
Xu Ziqi.

354
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
You beat up a civilian woman in public.

355
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
According to Tang Dynasty law, you can be punished on the spot.

356
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,280
You'll be tied up and taken to the magistrate's office.

357
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,840
The head of Buliangren.

358
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,040
You're nothing but a dog of the imperial court.

359
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,380
How dare you strike me!

360
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,090
I may be a dog of the imperial court.

361
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,200
But you publicly assaulted a civilian woman.

362
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,360
Then attempted to assault an imperial official.

363
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,690
You're worse than a dog.

364
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Xu Ziqi,

365
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,800
he's the Chamber of Commerce chairman.

366
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Stop it now!

367
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Why should I stop?

368
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I said I would beat you, and I mean it.

369
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,200
Xu Ziqi!

370
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,000
Stop it, Xu Ziqi!

371
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,680
You've got guts.

372
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,240
This is what I should do.

373
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,520
Boss, this is the Nine-Cycle Revival Pill.

374
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,490
Isn't it a waste to use it for external wounds?

375
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,490
Ouch!

376
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,160
It hurts!

377
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
Am I being that rough?

378
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,720
Ow!

379
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,680
That hurts!

380
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll be gentler, just stop yelling.

381
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,120
So clumsy.

382
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
Xu Ziqi

383
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,200
Look how miserable I am.

384
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,980
Please don't be angry with me anymore, okay?

385
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,140
You brought this on yourself.

386
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,010
Do you know how much it costs to open a shop?

387
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
Easy for you to say.

388
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,640
This...

389
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
All this money

390
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,690
was collected by my Buliangren brothers for you.

391
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
It's not for free.

392
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,420
Just like you said,

393
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,520
consider it as buying shares in your business.

394
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,640
There's a list inside

395
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,900
recording who contributed what amount.

396
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,480
Xu Ziqi, I can't accept this money.

397
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
I went fundraising in Guiren Street

398
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,360
because there

399
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,400
are all wealthy ladies and madams.

400
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,200
These one or two taels of silver

401
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,120
mean nothing to them.

402
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,840
But these one or two taels

403
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,010
are your brothers' monthly expenses.

404
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,780
I can't take it.

405
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,720
Besides,

406
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,770
though you won't say it,

407
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,520
I know that this time,

408
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,920
after you beat up the guild elder like that,

409
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,960
the merchant guild will surely cause trouble for you.

410
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,840
Miss Xiaofei,

411
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,200
please accept it.

412
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
We believe in you.

413
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,280
That's right. Who cares about the merchant guild?

414
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,000
We've been annoyed with them for a long time.

415
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
They deliberately inflate prices

416
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,720
making life difficult for ordinary people.

417
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,180
Exactly. This is just our monthly expenses.

418
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,840
With your ability to extort our boss Xu,

419
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,850
we'll get our money back in less than half a month.

420
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
Just take it,

421
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,640
or our boss won't be able to sleep night after night.

422
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,100
Who won't be able to sleep?

423
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
What are you all doing in the camp?

424
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,200
Go out on patrol now.

425
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Are you that idle?

426
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Yes.

427
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,520
Take this medicine with you.

428
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,880
It's no use keeping it in the camp.

429
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,940
It would be a waste.

430
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,440
Apply this medicine three times a day,

431
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,360
thickly. Don't wrap it with gauze.

432
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,170
It needs air to heal faster.

433
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,000
This camp

434
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,100
is built quite impressively.

435
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,920
Elder Xing has four broken ribs,

436
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,440
both legs are fractured,

437
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,880
and the hand he used to hit Hua Xiaofei is completely shattered.

438
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
This Xu Ziqi is absolutely inhuman.

439
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,200
With Xu Ziqi's martial arts skills,

440
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,460
if he had truly wanted to kill Elder Xing,

441
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,160
he definitely wouldn't be alive now.

442
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,480
Xu Ziqi

443
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,040
just wanted to get revenge for Hua Xiaofei.

444
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,440
I've heard about Elder Xing's incident.

445
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,520
Is there anything I can do to help?

446
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,920
It's good that Elder Xing was taught a lesson by Xu Ziqi.

447
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,760
He's been arrogant and disrespectful for too long.

448
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,890
It would be beneficial if he learns to restrain himself.

449
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,920
I called you here for another matter.

450
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,440
Do you know where Hua Xiaofei's portrait has gone?

451
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,280
Yes.

452
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
The portrait of the flower queen.

453
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,520
What other portrait would it be?

454
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,680
Did you see it?

455
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,440
The last time I saw it,

456
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,140
it was hanging in the center of the main hall.

457
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,200
If you hear or see where the portrait has gone,

458
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,140
report to the guild immediately.

459
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,960
Although she's no longer the flower queen,

460
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,200
we're concerned someone might take the portrait

461
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,760
and use our guild's name

462
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,980
to do things that harm our interests.

463
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
I understand.

464
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,260
Respected Elders,

465
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,120
I humbly dare

466
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,720
to plead for Xu Ziqi.

467
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,220
What Xu Ziqi did was indeed wrong.

468
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,760
I will make sure he apologizes to Elder Xing with proper contrition.

469
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,840
Elder Xing was indeed in the wrong first.

470
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,100
It doesn't matter.

471
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,220
But Fang Lihen, have you ever thought

472
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,840
when Xu Ziqi was beating Elder Xing,

473
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,360
did he consider you at all?

474
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,720
Xu Ziqi.

475
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,520
You asked me to give you time

476
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,980
to investigate the truth.

477
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Yet you acted recklessly yourself.

478
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Where exactly have you placed

479
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,260
the trust that I and the court have in you?

480
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,050
I did assault Elder Xing

481
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,330
partly out of personal vengeance.

482
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,660
But that Elder Xing

483
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,450
beat Hua Xiaofei, a defenseless woman, in public

484
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,500
until she was covered in bruises.

485
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,090
I am willing to accept any punishment.

486
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,120
So you beat Elder Xing until he was severely injured.

487
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,000
Now the Chamber of Commerce demands severe punishment for you.

488
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,680
What am I supposed to do?

489
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,480
Tomorrow,

490
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,960
I will have you dismissed from office and investigated.

491
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,040
And publicly announce

492
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,570
that you will never be allowed to serve as an official again.

493
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,450
I will follow Your Highness's arrangements.

494
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
I understand.

495
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,760
After my dismissal,

496
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,240
the Chamber of Commerce will surely lower their guard.

497
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,880
Without my official position,

498
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,640
many things will be easier to accomplish,

499
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,280
and I won't burden the court.

500
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
Master Xu,

501
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,740
I hope you understand Her Highness's good intentions.

502
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,420
Her Highness is doing this

503
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
to protect you as well.

504
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,960
I understand.

505
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,960
Let me tell you about my shop in detail.

506
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,160
We focus on affordable beauty products

507
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,680
and frequently updated items.

508
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
They're not only effective

509
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,600
but affordable for all girls.

510
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,040
It's hard to stay enthusiastic when you're like this.

511
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,810
All these things you're talking about

512
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,580
have nothing to do with me.

513
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
I only use custom-made products from Hero.

514
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,240
And don't think I don't know

515
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,040
that you're challenging the Chamber of Commerce.

516
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,160
Why should we offend the Chamber of Commerce for your sake?

517
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm not asking you to use the beauty products I developed.

518
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,400
I think we can join forces.

519
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,640
With my and Yingxiong's skills, we can create good products.

520
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,720
And you would be our walking advertisement,

521
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,520
promoting the products.

522
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,040
Zhang Guicai's transport network can open up the market.

523
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,120
No matter how good the Chamber of Commerce is at business,

524
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,480
they only consider the officials and nobles.

525
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,920
How many officials and nobles are there in the Tang Dynasty?

526
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,120
And how many ordinary people are there?

527
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,000
This is an untapped market!

528
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,360
I sell one box of Yingyan cosmetics

529
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,960
and earn several taels of silver.

530
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
How much can you earn from one box?

531
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,880
The girls who buy my products

532
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,380
can probably only afford a few strings of coins.

533
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,440
But if one box sells for three strings of coins...

534
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,500
How much would a hundred boxes bring?

535
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,620
Three taels of silver.

536
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,840
I've done a survey of the girls in Chang'an.

537
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,200
There are 500,000 of them.

538
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,360
Even if only one person

539
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,290
out of a hundred buys my cosmetics,

540
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,010
how many people is that?

541
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,120
5,000 people.

542
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,200
And how much money is that?

543
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,440
150 taels.

544
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,120
The new beauty brand jointly founded by me, Hua Xiaofei,

545
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,880
Gu Jin'er,

546
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,880
Zhang Guicai,

547
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,800
and Yingxiong

548
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,360
is officially

549
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,920
opening for business today.

550
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,640
[Brand]

551
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:10,960
One, two, three.

552
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,820
One, two, pack.

553
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,960
Over here.

554
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,840
Hey, Hua Xiaofei,

555
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,040
can't you hire more people to plant these flowers?

556
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,160
Yeah.

557
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,280
Where would I get the money, my dear?

558
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,640
We only raised 70 taels

559
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,160
and it's all gone.

560
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,160
Let's take a break.

561
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,440
Boss.

562
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,400
I saw Miss Xiaofei with Zhang Guicai and others

563
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,170
planting flowers in the field.

564
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,440
Is that so?

565
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:49,920
Yes.

566
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,780
Hurry up. Get everyone together.

567
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,490
Yes, sir.

568
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
Today,

569
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,160
all our patrol duties are finished.

570
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,520
So,

571
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,360
we're going on an outing.

572
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,680
Great!

573
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,600
It's been so long since we went out.

574
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,440
It's been too long since we had a break.

575
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,770
Today, we won't go home until we're drunk.

576
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,000
This area has been requisitioned by us, the Buluoren.

577
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,130
All unauthorized personnel must wait outside the rope.

578
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,370
What's going on with these two?

579
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,500
Are they fighting?

580
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,880
Seems like it.

581
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,080
Look at Master Xu's eyes.

582
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,250
If he rolls them any further, they'll reach the heavens.

583
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,640
What's wrong with Xiao Fei and Brother Xu's eyes?

584
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,400
Did they catch an eye disease?

585
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Weren't they just fine a moment ago?

586
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,840
We need to search over there too.

587
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,480
You, go search there.

588
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,770
They're quite capable.

589
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,640
Indeed.

590
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,840
Come.

591
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,440
Boss, we've finished planting.

592
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,840
Everyone has assembled.

593
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Thank you all for your hard work.

594
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,840
Today's outing

595
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
ends here.

596
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,180
You can all go back now.

597
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,400
Go home.

598
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,960
I don't know

599
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,720
if after today

600
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,360
I'll still be able to help you.

601
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,640
Like this.

602
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,820
It's perfectly straight.

603
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,620
It looks a bit crooked.

604
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,300
Isn't it a bit crooked?

605
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,090
I just felt it wasn't straight.

606
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,570
Let's try again.

607
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,730
Can't even put this up properly. Strange.

608
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
I was just passing by to check on things.

609
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,680
Wishing you a prosperous opening

610
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
and all the best.

611
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
I'll be going now.

612
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
Take care, Master Xu.

613
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,920
What are you doing?

614
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,250
I'll go help over there.

615
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,120
Miss Xiaofei.

616
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:22,960
Miss Yang.

617
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,969
What's going on?

618
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,760
Smooth opening. Good fortune at all times.

619
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,960
Miss Yang,

620
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,920
what brings you here?

621
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,400
Why don't we sit down and catch up?

622
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,159
Sure.

623
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
I was hoping to have a chat with you, Miss Xiaofei.

624
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,920
Alright.

625
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,600
Let go.

626
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
By the way, what were you talking about earlier?

627
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,440
About Master Xu, of course.

628
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,240
I've arranged an outing with Master Xu.

629
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,520
I wonder if Miss Xiaofei minds.

630
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,960
I don't mind.

631
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,740
Feel free to go find Master Xu.

632
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Miss Xiaofei, you truly don't mind

633
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,200
that I'm going out alone with Master Xu?

634
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
Could it be

635
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,400
that Miss Xiaofei's affections aren't for Master Xu?

636
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,090
Master Xu isn't here today.

637
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,130
Perhaps Miss Xiaofei could speak freely,

638
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,880
so I can understand the whole situation.

639
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,440
I like men

640
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,320
with money and power.

641
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,520
Xu Ziqi...

642
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,560
No, no.

643
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,080
But Master Xu is chivalrous and righteous,

644
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,850
truly a legendary hero.

645
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,360
What matters is everyday life.

646
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,520
Can reputation be eaten as food?

647
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Can martial arts skills be spent as money?

648
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,440
I never expected Miss Xiaofei to be so calculating.

649
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,760
You flatter me.

650
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,820
Hello, Young Master Fang.

651
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,560
Father.

652
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,520
Debiao.

653
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,880
You're here too.

654
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,440
Yes.

655
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,340
I heard a former top courtesan was setting up shop here.

656
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,700
I thought it was Gu Jin'er.

657
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,240
Why are you here too,

658
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,000
Hua Xiaofei?

659
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,960
I convinced Jin'er to open a shop with me.

660
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,040
It was all my idea.

661
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,760
I was planning to find a suitable opportunity

662
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,020
to tell you about this.

663
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,960
I didn't expect

664
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,440
you'd come looking today.

665
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,490
Have you registered as a merchant?

666
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,120
Yes.

667
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,340
Did you consider me at all?

668
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,920
Did you think about me even for a moment?

669
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,800
How can I,

670
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,450
Fang Lihen, ever show my face in public again?

671
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,880
Fang Lihen.

672
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,040
You are you,

673
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,960
and I am me.

674
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,480
My becoming a merchant has nothing to do with you.

675
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,680
Nothing to do with me?

676
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,360
Everyone in Chang'an knows

677
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,020
I've already proposed to you.

678
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,170
How can this have nothing to do with me?

679
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Fang Lihen, I'm sorry.

680
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,640
I must do this.

681
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,440
The person I love is against the Merchants' Guild.

682
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,170
My good brother has badly beaten the Guild Elder.

683
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Why?

684
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Why didn't you consider me at all?

685
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
If you really insist on becoming a merchant,

686
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,920
no one can protect you.

687
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,120
Xu Ziqi has already been dismissed because of you.

688
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,600
Xu Ziqi?

689
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,080
What happened to him?

690
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,210
Xu Ziqi publicly beat the Guild Elder.

691
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,050
He's been dismissed and is under investigation.

692
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,440
Xu Ziqi, were you really dismissed?

693
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,080
Master Xu.

694
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,700
This...

695
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
I was wondering...

696
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,780
You usually wear Buliangren uniform when patrolling.

697
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
So it's true, isn't it?

698
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Dismissed from Buliangren service

699
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,010
and banned from official positions forever.

700
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,920
Your future husband holds a high position

701
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,160
and great authority.

702
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,890
Never allowed to hold official positions again.

703
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
Xu Ziqi.

704
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,280
So this means that you

705
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,500
can never hold an important position again.

706
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,000
I used to think all those things you said

707
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,640
were just jokes.

708
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,780
Now I've really been demoted and dismissed.

709
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,000
You don't even care how I'll make a living.

710
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,480
Second, you don't care what happens to me.

711
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,610
You only care if I can keep my position.

712
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,440
I...

713
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,560
Xu Ziqi...

714
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,290
That's not what I meant.

715
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,760
Miss Xiaofei,

716
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,760
so what you just said

717
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,440
was actually true.

718
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,960
I...

719
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,380
I know you have feelings for Hua Xiaofei.

720
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,970
Now I'm giving you two options.

721
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,580
First, Hua Xiaofei surrenders to the chamber of commerce,

722
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,880
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

723
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,120
Second,

724
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,400
Hua Xiaofei will no longer pose

725
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,960
any threat to the guild.

726
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,720
By 'no threat,' you mean...

727
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,640
She'll disappear.

728
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,120
Please give me some time.

729
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,080
I will make Xiaofei surrender to the guild.

730
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,360
Xiaofei,

731
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,090
when will you understand my difficult position?

732
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,560
Sir,

733
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,120
It's cold in late autumn.

734
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,360
Don't catch a chill.

735
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,160
You have many matters waiting for your attention.

736
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,720
Yang Lin.

737
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,160
Elder Yi

738
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,700
wants us to pretend

739
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,970
to support Xiaofei's business

740
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,040
in order to bring her shop into the guild.

741
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,440
If I don't follow the Elder's instructions,

742
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,240
Xiaofei

743
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,050
may be in mortal danger.

744
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,100
This matter cannot be defied.

745
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,240
You have no other choice, sir.

746
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,040
Xiaofei's entry into the merchant registry

747
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,770
is something I deeply despise.

748
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Now

749
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,210
I can only follow the guild's lead.

750
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,490
Xiaofei's merchant status

751
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,000
can never be removed.

752
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,400
Sir,

753
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,960
although without an imperial decree her status cannot be changed,

754
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,800
but

755
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,120
I can see that Xiaofei

756
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,280
sincerely wants to run this shop.

757
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,960
Perhaps you could help Miss Xiaofei,

758
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,760
but it's best not to expect anything in return.

759
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
If there's no reward for doing this,

760
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,780
then why should I do it?

761
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,440
Xu Ziqi acts recklessly.

762
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
I really don't know what he's thinking.

763
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,450
Everything Xiaofei wants now,

764
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,370
he cannot provide any of it.

765
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,980
But I can give her everything.

766
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,320
All I want

767
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,280
is her heart.

768
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,440
Why are all these flowers white?

769
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,240
Xiaofei bought several kinds of seeds.

770
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,960
I'm afraid when the workers were planting,

771
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,580
they took the wrong seeds.

772
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,000
How can we make colored cosmetics with so many white flowers?

773
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,600
These... these are useless.

774
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,080
Months of hard work wasted.

775
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,040
Never to be admitted to official service again.

776
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,560
Your future husband holds high position and great power,

777
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,800
has immense wealth,

778
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,440
is virtuous and exceptionally handsome.

779
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,300
You know that I have feelings for you,

780
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,880
don't you?

781
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,400
You must make the right choice.

782
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,730
Otherwise, it will cause a chain reaction

783
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,280
affecting many people.

784
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,760
Xiaofei.

785
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,600
Fang Lihen.

786
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,520
I don't want to talk about Shang Ji with you.

787
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,900
If you want to scold me,

788
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,880
do it another day.

789
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,640
Wait.

790
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,120
These idiots can't even plant flowers correctly.

791
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,520
They're good for nothing except fighting.

792
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,720
What's this?

793
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
This is a gift for you.

794
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,280
A gift.

795
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,120
Xiaowei, I've heard about the flowers.

796
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,520
I'll ask my men to plant new ones right away.

797
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,480
Xu.

798
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,360
The flowers take 15 days to bloom.

799
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,000
And another 15 days to process.

800
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,200
That's a whole month.

801
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,210
How can Xiaowei wait that long?

802
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,080
Besides,

803
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,080
you're no longer the leader of the Buliang men.

804
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,720
How can you

805
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,640
trouble your former brothers again?

806
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,440
Xiaowei.

807
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,020
If you just say yes,

808
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
if you want to run a stable business,

809
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,040
I will do everything I can to help you.

810
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,800
Xiaowei, your shop's operating costs...

811
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,560
You can't afford to wait another 15 days.

812
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,880
Xiaowei.

813
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,600
I have some silver here.

814
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,960
Take it for now to help you through.

815
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
When I get home,

816
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,840
I'll immediately pawn some antiques.

817
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,500
We'll find the money somehow.

818
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,960
It's just money.

819
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,420
I'll pay for it.

820
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,440
We can't let Xu pay again.

821
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,040
This gold

822
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,520
will be enough for you to get by for a year.

823
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,980
You'll have plenty of time

824
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,530
to grow the flowers you want

825
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,080
and develop the products you want to launch.

826
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,210
Even if the business doesn't succeed,

827
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,930
as long as you're happy, that's what matters.

828
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,920
Xiaofei, before

829
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,400
I was selfish and arbitrary,

830
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,600
thinking you started your business to challenge the guild.

831
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,800
After careful reflection,

832
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,860
on the opening day,

833
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,420
you were genuinely happy.

834
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,080
I finally realized

835
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,240
that joining the guild

836
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,520
was what you truly wanted to do.

837
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,040
Xiaofei.

838
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
I want to help you.

839
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,600
Hua Xiaofei.

840
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,280
Remember what you said before.

841
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,320
Don't forget it.

842
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,960
You said

843
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,040
you would never again be involved in

844
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,440
the chamber's harmful business dealings.

845
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,720
Xu,

846
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,520
that's not appropriate.

847
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
This isn't the chamber's business.

848
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,320
It's Xiaofei's life's work.

849
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,040
Zhang Guicai.

850
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,280
I can't take your money.

851
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,560
I really don't want Jin to feel indebted to you.

852
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,890
After all, this is something we all did together.

853
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,880
Xu Ziqi, you've done too much for me.

854
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,800
I don't want you to

855
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,580
pawn your treasured possessions for me.

856
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,960
I also don't want you

857
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,440
to give up doing what you love because of me.

858
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,360
Xiaofei, it's okay.

859
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,160
But the pressure is too much.

860
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,320
You're too good to me.

861
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,480
I really can't repay you.

862
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,600
Fang Lihen.

863
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,960
I accept your financial support and the shop.

864
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,440
Xiaofei, you and I are one.

865
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,880
Mr. Xu.

866
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,020
Officer Xu.

867
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,900
Take care, Officer Xu.

868
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,440
No, we are not one.

869
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,120
We have a written agreement.

870
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,440
I accepted your financial support

871
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,720
because this business

872
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,360
is Jin'er's

873
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,320
and Yingxiong's livelihood for the rest of their lives.

874
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,180
I can't let them lose everything.

875
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,360
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

876
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,320
Xiaofei, there's no rush for any of this.

877
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,760
I'm leaving now.
