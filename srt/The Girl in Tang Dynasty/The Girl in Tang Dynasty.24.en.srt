1
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Whether this marriage can happen

2
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,960
depends on you, Mr. Xu.

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,720
You have seven days to bring back the account book.

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,080
Otherwise, this wedding will be their death day.

5
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Mr. Xu,

6
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,640
do you remember

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,880
the poison my men fed you?

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
Fine.

9
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,360
This is outrageous!

10
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
Guards are supposed

11
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,200
to protect people's freedom.

12
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,400
Now under Mr. Wu's control,

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,640
they're violating that freedom instead.

14
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,920
Xiaofei.

15
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,120
You...

16
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,400
Xiaofei.

17
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,960
Don't worry.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
No.

19
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
I need to quickly tell Xu Ziqi

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,260
where the account book is.

21
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,920
There's still some time before the wedding.

22
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,050
We can figure something out together.

23
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,760
Okay.

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,040
Sir,

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,160
we've surrounded the Fang residence completely.

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Good.

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,130
Keep watching closely.

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,200
There will definitely be news coming out.

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,840
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,960
They really think by blocking people from coming and going

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,220
I'll be out of options.

32
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,520
The pigeon is out! Shoot!

33
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,520
There's another pigeon!

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Shoot!

35
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,660
We've decoded the pigeon's secret message.

36
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,520
This Hua Xiaofei really talks too much.

37
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,040
There's a row of soldiers on the left of the Fang mansion gate.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,080
And a row on the right.

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,640
A row in the front.

40
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,399
And another row at the back.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,930
This Hua Xiaofei...

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,970
Her mind works in strange ways.

43
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
Releasing so many pigeons...

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
Not a single important message.

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,290
Just endless babbling.

46
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,770
Keep watching closely.

47
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Kill all the carrier pigeons

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,330
in Chang'an to eliminate any future risk.

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,409
The second contact method:

50
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,080
Sound patterns corresponding to numbers.

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,680
The delivery method:

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,440
Hidden in songs.

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Miss Xiaofei,

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I'll brew you

55
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,450
10 cups of fine loquat syrup every day.

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Your voice won't give out then.

57
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
It's much more moist now.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
They're all open.

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,140
Has everyone been assigned their tasks?

60
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
Everything's been arranged properly.

61
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,760
The guards at Mr. Wu's place

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,960
are working in two shifts with one team.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Besides you, there's this team

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
working once every hour.

65
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,440
The kitchen has also prepared the loquat drink.

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Good.

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,520
The key is that we absolutely cannot stop.

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
Cannot stop. Cannot stop.

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,800
Gong, shang, jue, qingjue, zhi, yu, biangong

70
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,530
It's an advanced version of the five-note scale,

71
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
representing seven musical notes

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,760
corresponding to numbers 1 through 7.

73
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,560
Xiaofei must be trying to use numbers

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,320
to send me a message.

75
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,080
We just need to find the corresponding source text to decode it.

76
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,760
But books using numbers as keys

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
are way too many!

78
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,440
King Yan Xu's secret lover.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,760
The numbers Xiaofei transmitted

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,000
follow a pattern.

81
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,700
They need to be grouped

82
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,680
three at a time,

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
twelve characters in total.

84
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,320
Retrieve the account book within five days.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
Leyou Garden.

86
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,159
But there are still three more characters.

87
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,440
I...

88
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,810
Sir, the guards can't hold on anymore.

89
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,680
Running up and down all day is one thing,

90
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
but now Hua Xiaofei is also causing trouble,

91
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
making a fuss ten times a day.

92
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,120
Our men have to stand guard,

93
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,760
watch the inside and defend the outside.

94
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,880
It's unbearable.

95
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,440
How many days until the wedding?

96
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Three more days.

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
No need to wait three days.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
The wedding will be tomorrow.

99
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,410
Sir, isn't this too sudden?

100
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,560
I intend to catch them by surprise.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Xu Ziqi has been busy making trouble these five days,

102
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,880
surely planning his countermeasures.

103
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,200
I had it planned from the beginning.

104
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
This wedding won't wait seven days.

105
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,120
I want to catch him off guard.

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,560
What if Xu Ziqi can't find the account book?

107
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,290
Even if he can't find it, he'll have information.

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,930
We'll use two lives to force him to tell the truth.

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,080
Kill all three of them

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,080
to eliminate future troubles.

111
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,320
We'll find the account book ourselves.

112
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,120
Sir, your foresight is brilliant.

113
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,780
Report!

114
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,440
Boss Xu!

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Something terrible has happened!

116
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
Wu Si has taken Young Master Fang and Miss Xiaofei

117
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,080
to the Wu residence.

118
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
They're getting married tomorrow.

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
I need to find someone now.

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,250
Contact General Qin immediately.

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,120
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,760
Hey.

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong?

124
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
I feel unsettled.

125
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
We have no other choice.

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,679
We've done what we can. The rest is up to fate.

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
It's going to be fine.

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,919
I've always had good luck.

129
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,480
The auspicious time is approaching.

130
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,720
The couple should get ready.

131
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,440
Dear couple,

132
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,080
don't miss the auspicious time.

133
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,420
The auspicious time has arrived!

134
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,920
Bride and groom, come out!

135
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
Music!

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,280
The bride steps over the fire basin.

137
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
With graceful manner and gentle heart.

138
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Husband leads, wife follows, prosperity comes.

139
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,200
Cherish your peers, respect your elders.

140
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,720
Today

141
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,840
is the wedding day of my adopted son Fang Lihen.

142
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,620
Lihen and Xiaofei have known each other for over a year.

143
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,800
It began with love at first sight.

144
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,960
And they've faced many challenges together.

145
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,440
I always felt

146
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
that I was all alone.

147
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
But since I met you,

148
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,940
three years after my family's downfall,

149
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,680
I finally feel that

150
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
I have a soul again.

151
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
You truly are my future husband.

152
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,560
It's alright.

153
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
I'll try my best to fight those bad people with you.

154
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,560
The newlyweds bow,

155
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,320
first bow to heaven and earth.

156
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,080
Second bow to the parents.

157
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,440
Husband and wife bow to each other.

158
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,680
Xiaofei.

159
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,920
Xu Ziqi.

160
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,400
Xiaofei.

161
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
Just this final bow left.

162
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,080
Once the ceremony is complete,

163
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,600
she will be yours.

164
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Fang Lihen.

165
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Let's complete the ceremony,

166
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,210
husband and wife bow to each other.

167
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,600
Xiaofei.

168
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,010
Husband and wife bow to each other.

169
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,840
Bow now.

170
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Xiaofei.

171
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
Bow quickly.

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,800
Bride and groom drink the wedding wine.

173
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,040
Drink.

174
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
You drink too.

175
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,020
Someone come here!

176
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,960
Everyone except Wu Manor guards

177
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
get out now!

178
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
Everyone out!

179
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,570
Where's the ledger?

180
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,560
Where's the antidote?

181
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,720
Give me the ledger,

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,400
and after I verify it's authentic,

183
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,530
I'll naturally give you the antidote.

184
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,480
The painting.

185
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,890
The ledger is hidden inside the painting.

186
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,920
Sir, we've obtained the ledger.

187
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,380
Let's destroy it quickly.

188
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,060
This is Yiyi's handiwork.

189
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,440
Every year, the portrait of the top courtesan

190
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,170
is personally painted by Yiyi.

191
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,960
Yiyi excels at fine brushwork and embroidery.

192
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,080
If the account book was embroidered with gold thread

193
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,010
and hidden inside the portrait...

194
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,680
Before Yiyi died,

195
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,160
what exactly did she tell you?

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,680
Why didn't my people rescue her

197
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
before Yiyi died?

198
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,740
You actually wanted to save Elder Yi?

199
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,280
Wasn't Elder Yi forced to death by you?

200
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,890
How could I let Yiyi die?

201
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
I loved Yiyi so deeply.

202
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,880
Could it be...

203
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,480
Didn't Yiyi take her own life to protect me?

204
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
But why

205
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,730
would she leave this account book?

206
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,680
Knowing this account book would cost me my life.

207
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,440
Why?

208
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,800
You've already verified the account book

209
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,320
and confirmed it's authentic.

210
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Where's the antidote?

211
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,680
Why would Yi Yi leave this account book behind?

212
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,600
Why?

213
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,560
Brother,

214
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,440
can't you deal with this issue later?

215
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,280
The antidote, brother!

216
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,920
Go to hell!

217
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,960
Elder Yi told me where to find the account book

218
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,090
and how to decode it.

219
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,300
Elder Yi also said this was her life-saving secret.

220
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,080
What else did she say?

221
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,600
She said

222
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,680
she wanted to bring you down,

223
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,720
so she deliberately told me about the ledger

224
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,160
to fulfill her wish.

225
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,400
What else did she say?

226
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,560
She also said before she died,

227
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,720
it was never about protecting you,

228
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,800
but for me.

229
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,480
She never trusted you.

230
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,800
She never had genuine feelings for you.

231
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,200
Everyone who came here today must die.

232
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,700
Hua Xiaofei, you must die too.

233
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,130
Xu Ziqi will die as well.

234
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,970
Fang Lihen will be the first

235
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,560
to die.

236
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
Don't think that drugging you

237
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,100
means I'll let you off easily.

238
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,280
I am a man who

239
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,650
never forgets a grudge.

240
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
Kill them!

241
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Xu Ziqi!

242
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,859
Xu Ziqi, move one more time and see what happens.

243
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,720
Break Xu Ziqi's limbs.

244
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,200
No!

245
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Xu Ziqi!

246
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,560
Ziqi!

247
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,960
Wu, you'll die a terrible death!

248
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,840
The best torture for you

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,440
is to watch your loved one beaten like this

250
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,400
while you're powerless to stop it.

251
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,520
Go ahead and cry if you want to.

252
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,640
Master Wu, please.

253
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,640
Please spare them.

254
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,490
I'll serve you like a slave.

255
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,360
Master Wu.

256
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Lihen.

257
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,570
You're the most dispensable one here.

258
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,280
Ziqi!

259
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
Xu Ziqi!

260
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Xu Ziqi!

261
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,000
Ziqi!

262
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,120
Xu Ziqi!

263
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Why did you...

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,680
I didn't mean to help you.

265
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,660
Before I could even react,

266
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,690
I was already blocking for you.

267
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Since I'm going to die today anyway,

268
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
taking one more hit or avoiding one sword,

269
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,730
it doesn't matter anymore.

270
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,280
Xiaofei,

271
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,840
Even at a time like this,

273
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,050
I'm still making you worry.

274
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,280
You jerk.

275
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,760
At a time like this,

276
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,960
can't you say something nice?

277
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,220
Don't be so harsh on me.

278
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,960
Xu Ziqi,

279
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,680
I love you.

280
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,960
I really love you.

281
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Xiaofei,

282
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,640
I love you too.

283
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,400
I really love you so much too.

284
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
You troublemaker!

285
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,160
I'll cut you down!

286
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,920
No!

287
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,200
Antidote!

288
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,280
I never planned

289
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,210
to let them leave here alive today.

290
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
Why would I keep an antidote?

291
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,440
This poison will kill within half an incense stick's time.

292
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,640
Neither of them will live much longer.

293
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
The account books have been destroyed.

294
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,200
What can you possibly do to me now?

295
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,880
Xiaofei.

296
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,940
How dare you arrest a royal relative!

297
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Here's the antidote.

298
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,160
Here's the antidote.

299
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,440
Debiao.

300
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,440
Official Wu wants to move up Xiaofei and Ali's wedding

301
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
to tomorrow,

302
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,000
and plans to poison their wedding wine.

303
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,280
You're a palace lady,

304
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,920
please hurry to the palace tonight

305
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,980
and ask the Empress for the antidote.

306
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,280
Master Xu, the antidote is here.

307
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,680
Quick,

308
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,420
give it to Xiaofei and Ali.

309
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,200
Hurry!

310
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,760
But this Tianshan Snow Lotus,

311
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,920
thousand-year lingzhi,

312
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,000
century-old wild ginseng,

313
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,120
72-ingredient Universal Antidote Pill...

314
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,280
There's only one left in the palace.

315
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,680
What? What Universal Antidote Pill?

316
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Tianshan Snow Lotus,

317
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,040
thousand-year lingzhi,

318
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,360
century-old wild ginseng,

319
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,680
72-ingredient Universal Antidote Pill.

320
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,200
What Tianshan Snow Lotus?

321
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,280
Tianshan Snow Lotus, thousand-year lingzhi,

322
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,220
century-old wild ginseng, 72-ingredient Universal Antidote Pill.

323
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,120
What thousand-year lingzhi and century-old wild ginseng?

324
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
And what was the other thing?

325
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,240
Tianshan Snow Lotus,

326
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,440
thousand-year lingzhi, century-old wild ginseng,

327
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,520
72-ingredient Universal Antidote Pill.

328
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,200
That name sounds

329
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,530
more like it would kill people than save them.

330
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,040
We're all concerned about whether it can cure the poison,

331
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,100
only you care about what it's called.

332
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,760
If you two keep talking like this,

333
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
they'll definitely die.

334
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,400
Can you be serious?

335
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,920
Xu Ziqi.

336
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,200
I was just thinking,

337
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
in all my life,

338
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,840
all these years,

339
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,120
I have no regrets.

340
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Xiaofei, look,

341
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm so badly injured

342
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,860
I probably won't survive either.

343
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,040
If you die,

344
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,160
then I will have regrets.

345
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
You need to be well,

346
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
so I won't have any regrets.

347
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,740
Do you understand?

348
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,040
Even now,

349
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,420
you're still scolding me.

350
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,360
If you die,

351
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,720
In the future,

352
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,960
I won't even have the spirit to cook anymore.

353
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
Alright.

354
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,500
I'll stay with you.

355
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't want that.

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,720
Get away.

357
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,720
Brother Xu.

358
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Brother Xu.

359
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Ziqi.

360
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,160
Xu Ziqi.

361
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,200
You.

362
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,200
You big fool.

363
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,960
Xiaofei.

364
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,760
If you're not here,

365
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,600
what's the point of me living on?

366
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,960
I still want to...

367
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,240
See you slowly grow old and ugly one day.

368
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,120
I'll go with you,

369
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,160
so I can see it, right?

370
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I... didn't I just die?

371
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,400
How did I end up back here?

372
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,880
Hua Xiaofei, you're on the right path now.

373
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll help you one last time

374
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,760
to overcome this life-and-death crisis.

375
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,680
Healed without medicine. Don't go!

376
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,720
Explain yourself clearly!

377
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,960
Xiaofei.

378
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,440
I'm back now.

379
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Xiaofei.

380
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
Here's the antidote.

381
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Here's the antidote.

382
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
This time I remembered:

383
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,680
Tianshan Snow Lotus,

384
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,400
thousand-year lingzhi,

385
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,240
hundred-year wild ginseng, and the 72-ingredient Universal Cure Pill.

386
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,040
Xiaofei, what's happening?

387
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,200
I am the miracle of love.

388
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,760
Zhang Guicai,

389
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,720
hurry up and give Xu Ziqi some hemostatic medicine.

390
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,520
I've fully recovered,

391
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,680
do you want me to be a widow? Hurry!

392
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,200
The best hemostatic medicine.

393
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,840
I'll do it.

394
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
You bastard!

395
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,170
You think you're so clever.

396
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,840
I'll beat you into a colorful pig's head.

397
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,040
Sir.

398
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,780
You think acting all romantic

399
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,040
will whitewash your twisted behavior?

400
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,640
I'll beat you so badly you'll be crying for your mother.

401
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,860
Brother Xu,

402
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,680
Zhang Guicai has arrived as reinforcement.

403
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,280
Gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu.

404
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,680
He, yi, si, chi, gong.

405
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,440
You bastard,

406
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
why did you only come now?

407
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Xu Ziqi.

408
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm here by the Emperor's order.

409
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,720
My mission is

410
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,050
to protect you when your life is in danger.

411
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,660
I've been waiting for this opportunity.

412
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,840
Were you just standing outside

413
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,880
watching me get stabbed?

414
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,200
Yes, you were stabbed

415
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,260
right in the chest,

416
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,210
which was exactly the life-threatening moment.

417
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,920
Couldn't you have come earlier?

418
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
Don't rush.

419
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
Did you have to wait until I got stabbed

420
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
and watch Xiaofei and Ali get poisoned

421
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,440
before you showed up?

422
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,400
Brother Xu,

423
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,960
if your life wasn't in danger

424
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
and I rushed in,

425
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
that would be disobeying orders,

426
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,100
which is punishable by death.

427
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,680
I...

428
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,840
Brother Xu.

429
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Don't get upset.

430
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,040
If I weren't too weak to fight you right now...

431
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,640
I would...

432
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,940
You should rest first.

433
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,840
Rest a bit.

434
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,680
I, Zhang Guicai,

435
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,880
became an imperial secret agent at 14

436
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
and have been undercover for 13 years.

437
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,360
Today,

438
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,880
I can finally serve my country openly.

439
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
To conceal my identity before,

440
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,440
I always pretended to be old and feeble.

441
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,400
Until Brother Xu started investigating the accounts,

442
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,440
I finally resumed my martial arts training.

443
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,400
Today, let me show you all

444
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,720
the true power of the first imperial secret agent.

445
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,900
Hold him steady for me.

446
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,320
You're truly shameless.

447
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,640
Awesome!

448
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,090
By order of His Majesty,

449
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,680
after examining the merchant guild's accounts,

450
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,960
all evidence is verified,

451
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,440
with both witness testimony and physical evidence.

452
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Wu Youxing is guilty of corruption and perversion of justice,

453
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,280
his crimes are unforgivable.

454
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,410
You claim this is the Empress's order?

455
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,120
Where is the imperial edict? Where is the token?

456
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,640
Or has the Empress come in person?

457
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,720
Don't think that bringing a group of people

458
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,450
and putting on this rescue show

459
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,880
will make anyone believe you.

460
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,780
Behold the Kanglong Scepter.

461
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,440
Official Di has submitted all testimonies and evidence

462
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,600
to His Majesty.

463
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Due to the urgency of the matter,

464
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,680
imperial detective Xu Ziqi has been specially ordered to carry the Kanglong Scepter

465
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,200
and escort Wu Youxing back to the Court of Justice.

466
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,400
This can't be happening.

467
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,240
My sister wouldn't treat me like this.

468
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,500
I need to see my sister.

469
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,450
Lord Wu, half of the entries in the account books,

470
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
along with witnesses and evidence,

471
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,960
you cannot escape.

472
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,920
It can't be. It can't be.

473
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,680
This isn't possible.

474
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,140
You never understood that

475
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,480
killing to secure power is absurd.

476
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,160
Using power to intimidate the weak

477
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
will ultimately lead to your downfall.

478
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,420
The Two Sovereigns

479
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,680
have always governed the Tang Dynasty with the people's hearts in mind,

480
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,640
knowing well that only by winning the people's support

481
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,280
can the Tang Dynasty establish a lasting foundation.

482
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,840
But you, Lord Wu,

483
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,160
relying on your royal connections,

484
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
have committed all manner of evil,

485
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,650
which is truly disgusting.

486
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,840
My family has worked so hard

487
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
to achieve our current position.

488
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,760
People strive for higher positions

489
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,280
precisely to be respected

490
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
and worshipped by others.

491
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,900
If power isn't for enjoying privileges,

492
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,280
what use is it?

493
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,480
Life is but a few decades long.

494
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,280
If one doesn't live in luxury,

495
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
wouldn't that waste this lifetime?

496
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,680
The Tang Dynasty having officials like you

497
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,400
is truly shameful.

498
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,200
When you reach my position, you'll understand

499
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,680
being second only to one person

500
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
and above thousands is such a joyful thing.

501
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,200
I want to belittle others.

502
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,880
I want to control others.

503
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,360
I want to manipulate people's hearts.

504
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,440
I want everyone to submit to me.

505
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,280
This is the pleasure of privilege.

506
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,040
For so many years, I've hidden my true intentions

507
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
and depended on others

508
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,680
to achieve my current position.

509
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,240
I demand that everyone must submit to me.

510
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,210
Your words are completely absurd,

511
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,880
disgusting to hear,

512
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
and truly nauseating.

513
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,720
Those who don't win the people's hearts,

514
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,440
those without compassion,

515
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,180
those who only care about control and power,

516
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
will ultimately be overthrown

517
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,530
and meet a terrible end.

518
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,520
Xiaofei.

519
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,120
Xu Ziqi.

520
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,680
Ziqi.

521
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,400
Xu.

522
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,680
What's wrong with you?

523
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,570
Are you okay?

524
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,400
You hugged me too tight.

525
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,840
My wound

526
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,480
got squeezed.

527
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,120
Quick, call a doctor!

528
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,480
Get a doctor!

529
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,160
Doctor!

530
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,120
Call a doctor quickly!

531
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,360
Doctor!

532
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,200
Get a doctor now!

533
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,760
Xu Ziqi.

534
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,640
Doctor!

535
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,480
Everything has been settled.

536
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,920
Mr. Wu has been imprisoned.

537
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,000
As for me,

538
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,880
I was immediately sent home

539
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,000
to take care of the severely injured Xu Ziqi.

540
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,440
But sometimes I wonder,

541
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,680
with Xu Ziqi's constitution,

542
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,640
how come after a month

543
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,040
he's still moaning and groaning every day.

544
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,680
Bitter.

545
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,720
Not bitter, not bitter.

546
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,400
Here, have some candy.

547
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,680
Here.

548
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,000
Still bitter?

549
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,560
Hold me tighter before I take medicine.

550
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
You're naughty.

551
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Is this okay?

552
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,280
Can you

553
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,280
give me a kiss?

554
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,440
Please, I'm begging you.

555
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
Come take your medicine.

556
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,960
Fang Lihen

557
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,760
has redeemed himself by bringing down Lord Wu.

558
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
The Two Majesties have pardoned his family

559
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,440
and removed Fang Lihen's title as the son of a criminal.

560
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,200
His father can now return to court as an official.

561
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,180
That's wonderful!

562
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,200
Welcome home, master.

563
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,980
Welcome home, father and mother.

564
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,200
However,

565
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,720
Fang Lihen didn't continue down the path of officialdom.

566
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,960
Surprisingly.

567
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,760
He actually opened a restaurant

568
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,480
called Lihen Tower.

569
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,680
He brews his own wine every day.

570
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,440
He says

571
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,000
he hopes everyone who comes to drink at Lihen Tower

572
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
can drown their sorrows.

573
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,120
So.

574
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,240
we now have a place

575
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,680
where we can always get free food and drinks,

576
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
and this is it.

577
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Very nice.

578
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,370
You're here.

579
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Congratulations, Fang.

580
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
Congratulations, Young Master Fang.

581
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,240
Ali,

582
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,000
your Lihen Tower is getting more and more famous.

583
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,200
Soon all of Chang'an will know about it.

584
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,680
As expected from the former head of the merchants' guild,

585
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,000
your work is exceptional.

586
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's hard to please everyone.

587
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
I still have much to improve.

588
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,280
Come in, please.

589
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,840
Let's go.

590
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Erha.

591
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,920
Here's the menu.

592
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,440
Coming.

593
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,380
As usual, I'll order everything.

594
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
You order everything every time.

595
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,400
I really don't understand why you still look at the menu.

596
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
You never pay when you come to eat here.

597
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,260
My parents will go broke because of you sooner or later.

598
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
You all go upstairs and wait.

599
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,960
The dishes will be brought up soon.

600
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,520
I'll prepare the fish today.

601
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,200
Brother Xu.

602
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,440
I'll help you then.

603
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,960
Great.

604
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,760
Oh, right.

605
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,600
Last time you said fish tastes better with sugar.

606
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,460
Add more sugar.

607
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,920
Xiaofei, you can't cook at all.

608
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,200
Stop talking nonsense.

609
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,400
Just leave it to Ziqi.

610
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,170
Let's go.

611
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:47,920
Okay.

612
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,080
I'll go first.

613
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,640
Come.

614
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,240
Let's go upstairs first.

615
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,160
Fang Lihen.

616
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,480
I suddenly feel that

617
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,120
your attitude toward me seems different now.

618
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
We're old friends.

619
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,840
What could be different?

620
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,160
It's just a bit subtle.

621
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,240
And the way you look at me now

622
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
is much calmer.

623
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,040
Is it?

624
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,720
Maybe before I was

625
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,970
too obsessed with everything.

626
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
I always felt I had no choice.

627
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,440
With the chamber of commerce,

628
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
with family matters,

629
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,170
and with you,

630
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,600
I was too fixated.

631
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,400
I cared too much about gains and losses,

632
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
worried too much about outcomes,

633
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,050
and all my feelings became distorted.

634
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,720
Who told you to pick the wrong name?

635
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,480
'Hatred' all day long.

636
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,440
My father named me Lihen

637
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,340
hoping I would stay away from obsession and hatred.

638
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,120
Xiaofei, thank you for your passion and courage

639
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,920
for showing me

640
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
that blind obsession

641
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,180
isn't always a good thing.

642
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,840
Life actually offers many choices.

643
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,440
Alright.

644
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,680
Enough talk.

645
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,840
Hurry upstairs and get ready.

646
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,360
The food will be here soon.

647
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,960
Okay.

648
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,239
Drink to forget sorrows.

649
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,280
Yes.

650
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,560
Drink to forget sorrows,

651
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,040
and the world feels vast.

652
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,080
Lihen Tower.

653
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,840
Drink to forget sorrows.

654
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,400
It seems you're a man with a story.

655
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,719
I am

656
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,120
Fang Lihen.

657
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,840
I am Qingshang.

658
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,400
I just arrived in Chang'an

659
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,560
and opened a music shop

660
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,400
next to your establishment.

661
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,040
I know a little about music and literature.

662
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,440
Miss Qingshang, you are quite refined.

663
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,800
Life is short,

664
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,240
that's why we need wine and song.

665
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,160
It seems you also have a story to tell.

666
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
May I

667
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,400
invite you for a drink?

668
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,640
Very well. Drink to forget sorrows.

669
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,240
Please.

670
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,040
Hello.

671
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,400
I'm the master's attendant.

672
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,260
My name is Erha.

673
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,960
I'm my lady's maid.

674
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,820
My name is Samo.

675
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,520
Samo.

676
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,440
Samo...

677
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,780
What a lovely name.

678
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,440
Erha.

679
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
How festive.

680
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
As for me,

681
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,720
thanks to my clever business mind,

682
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,320
I've officially become the Chamber of Commerce president.

683
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,640
As for Xu Ziqi,

684
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,080
he finally managed to retire early

685
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,440
and contentedly became a house husband,

686
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,820
enjoying the blissful life of being kept by a wealthy wife.

687
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,720
However, he made an agreement with the Empress

688
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,800
that if the Great Tang ever faces any danger,

689
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,660
he, as Tang's top imperial agent,

690
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,680
must be the first to take action.

691
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,480
Good.

692
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,480
Finally, everything is settled.

693
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
Everything's back on track.

694
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,570
We should start planning our wedding now.

695
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,700
Making clothes for one couple

696
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,420
is exhausting enough,

697
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,900
and now I have to make them for you two as well.

698
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,240
But making clothes just for my darling

699
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
is worth any effort.

700
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,440
It's just too much work.

701
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,560
My body is so tired.

702
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,560
Are you sick?

703
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,760
Do you have medicine?

704
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,720
No way.

705
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,360
Oh, it's you.

706
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,640
Welcome the bride!

707
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,320
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

708
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,180
Congratulations, Miss Xiaofei.

709
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,400
Congratulations, Boss Xu! Best wishes!

710
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,260
We've finally made it to this day.

711
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,280
Have a little Xiaoqi soon!

712
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Bride, stop here.

713
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,960
Step over the fire basin.

714
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,920
Be dignified in behavior and gentle in manner.

715
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,370
Husband leads, wife follows, prosperity comes with unity.

716
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,900
Cherish your peers and respect your elders.

717
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,400
Good.

718
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,580
First bow to heaven and earth.

719
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,720
Second bow to the parents.

720
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,410
Husband and wife bow to each other.

721
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,400
Wonderful.

722
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,960
Good.

723
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,440
The ceremony is complete.

724
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
Wait a moment.

725
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,090
I want to add one more thing.

726
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,080
Now the groom may kiss the bride.

727
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,960
Children shouldn't watch this.

728
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,960
Escort to the bridal chamber.

729
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,720
Alright.

730
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,280
Well...

731
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,400
I have no experience.

732
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,960
I don't have much experience either.

733
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,920
Then I ask you, wife,

734
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,840
to work with me.

735
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,930
Then I ask you, husband,

736
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,880
to be gentle.

737
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,170
Don't panic.

738
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,560
No rush.

739
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,640
Keep your hands steady.

740
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,720
Not shaking.

741
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,520
Who pushed me?

742
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,160
What are you doing in here?

743
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,040
Can you all please quiet down?

744
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,120
Um...

745
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,120
We're

746
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,840
feeling a bit hot.

747
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,400
Yes, indeed.

748
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,160
Why don't we

749
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,980
have hot pot together?

750
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,600
H-hot pot?

751
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,120
Hot pot.

752
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,240
So hot.

753
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,960
Hot pot sounds good.

754
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,890
Hot pot is great.

755
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,480
Great.

756
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,000
Yes.

757
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,560
Good.

758
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,640
Alright.

759
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,660
Excellent.

760
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,360
Cheers!

761
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:40,800
Xiaofei,

762
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,960
do you have any unfulfilled dreams?

763
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,960
Good question. Let me think.

764
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,920
What about you all? What are your dreams?

765
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,920
I just want to marry Jin'er as soon as possible,

766
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,380
the sooner the better.

767
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,530
I hope our business becomes more successful,

768
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
so everyone knows that I, Gu Jin'er,

769
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,160
even without being a courtesan,

770
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,960
can still live a wonderful life.

771
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,000
I hope all men in the world can be themselves,

772
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,920
without worrying about others' opinions.

773
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,320
Well said.

774
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,280
As for me,

775
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,160
I hope all women in the world

776
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
can bravely be themselves.

777
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,920
I want to be the first female scholar in the Tang Dynasty,

778
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,600
a female scholar who can

779
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,320
advocate for all women's welfare.

780
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,250
I hope everyone can have close friends by their side,

781
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
family and loved ones to rely on.

782
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,960
May everyone's life be stable,

783
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,560
and their families blessed.

784
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,880
I hope there will be no more wars in this world,

785
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,970
and Anpingle

786
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
will no longer need to house anyone.

787
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,690
If that happens,

788
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,370
wouldn't the world be at peace?

789
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,880
I hope not to disappoint my ancestors' efforts,

790
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,000
and become a wealthy person who serves the country and its people.

791
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,760
Good.

792
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,480
Well said.

793
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,480
To our hopes!

794
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,440
Cheers!
