1
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,729
My Lord! My Lord!

2
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm here

3
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,800
I invited you here today

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,240
to tell you

5
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,080
that I've been hiding for years.

6
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,520
Depiao

7
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,079
Come on.

8
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,890
Here's your mother's incense. Thank you. Thank you.

9
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,920
All these years,

10
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,079
I've been telling you

11
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,370
your mother died young.

12
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,650
and was buried in her hometown.

13
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,400
Today,

14
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
I'll tell you

15
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,640
about your mother.

16
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
Your mother's name is Lv Ji.

17
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,960
She used to be a famous dancer in Chang'an.

18
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,920
Twenty years ago,

19
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,960
I met your mother.

20
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
I fell in love at first sight.

21
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
and got engaged.

22
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,800
And she had a regular guest.

23
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,079
At that time,

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,560
took over your mother.

25
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,079
Soon,

26
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
she was pregnant.

27
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm weak.

28
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,080
The doctor said if she doesn't want this child,

29
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,650
she might not be able to hold on.

30
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,220
Why don't you give birth to her? Let's go.

31
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
Besides,

32
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,959
she doesn't have much life left.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,120
I hope to keep Lu'er's child.

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
Even if it's not my own child,

35
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,980
as long as it's Green'er's blood,

36
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,560
just like she's by my side.

37
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Deok-biao.

38
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,370
After you were born,

39
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,760
I'll do my best

40
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,640
to give you a good life.

41
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
Your mother

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
had no choice in her life.

43
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,420
As your father,

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,960
I hope you can be safe and healthy forever.

45
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,880
Everything

46
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,320
Let it be.

47
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,320
People say

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
a woman's talent is virtue.

49
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,080
De Biao,

50
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,360
You like reading?

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,930
I'll support you

52
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
support you to study.

53
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,690
You like to be a female teacher.

54
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,520
I

55
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,200
support you to be a female teacher.

56
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520
Lyuer.

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,560
The child has grown up.

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,960
I

59
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,360
I didn't dare to say this before.

60
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,440
because I didn't want the kids to hear it.

61
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,880
Now,

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,880
the child knows the situation.

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
And you

64
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,680
is gone.

65
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,880
But love

66
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,940
is still there.

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,200
I

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
never regret

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,460
fighting against my life.

70
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,000
I

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,080
[I'm most proud of.]

72
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,200
First, our child, De Biao,

73
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
is unparalleled.

74
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Second,

75
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,440
I

76
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,700
fight with the heaven.

77
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,680
Fight with fate

78
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,080
for the relationship with you.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,440
I have

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
have gone beyond the heavenly will.

81
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,880
De Biao,

82
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,120
I hope you can

83
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
fight with your life.

84
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
[Fight for your life!]

85
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,120
Lu'er.

86
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,800
In the underworld,

87
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,520
in the underworld.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
I can rest in peace.

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,640
After Lord Xu recovers,

90
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,690
he will leave the mansion eventually.

91
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
It's still uncertain

92
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,880
is still unknown.

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,800
Your Excellency, when you proposed,

94
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
you've alarmed the whole Chang'an.

95
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
If Miss Li

96
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
leave with Lord Xu,

97
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't have much time left.

98
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,800
My lord.

99
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,120
I have a suggestion.

100
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,820
As the saying goes,

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,780
know yourself and your enemy.

102
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,760
and win every battle.

103
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,000
Lord Xu's heart...

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Lord Xu,

105
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,560
It's time to find out.

106
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,040
What are they doing?

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Zheng.

108
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,960
You scared me.

109
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
Are you okay?

110
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,180
Let me apply the medicine for you.

111
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
Separate hatred.

112
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,440
Your nose

113
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,400
is stung by bees.

114
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,920
No.

115
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,280
No need. Brother Xu is badly injured.

116
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
I have to apply medicine on him.

117
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,730
Don't come over.

118
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
Women should avoid suspicion.

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,960
Let's go.

120
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Avoid suspicion.

121
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,280
I'll go check.

122
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,920
You need to avoid suspicion.

123
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
Avoid suspicion?

124
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,080
At this point,

125
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
you're here again.

126
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,440
It's better to be honest

127
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
to be honest.

128
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,060
It's about Kou, right?

129
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,800
Yes.

130
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
Ziqi

131
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,160
I like Zheng.

132
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,860
And I want to marry her.

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,780
I already proposed to her.

134
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,560
You were there? Yes.

135
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,280
Li,

136
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,040
I was there too.

137
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,480
You did propose.

138
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
But she didn't agree.

139
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,440
So,

140
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,840
you want to snatch the crown from me?

141
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
No.

142
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,560
Fair competition.

143
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,960
Fair competition.

144
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
A gentleman's fight.

145
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,560
Deal.

146
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,080
I won't let you go.

147
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,560
You may leave now.

148
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,920
Yes.

149
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,980
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

150
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,200
My Lord.

151
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,410
I searched everywhere,

152
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,140
but no assassin was found.

153
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
This crossbow...

154
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Lord Xu.

155
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,720
We've got the delinquents to investigate carefully.

156
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,560
Lord Xu said

157
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
the armory

158
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,400
has registered all the iron mine in Tang.

159
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,420
The arrow of this crossbow

160
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,970
is indeed made of iron mine.

161
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
But from weight and purity,

162
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
are not made by folk craftsmanship.

163
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,930
Who else could it be?

164
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,560
The four elders.

165
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,560
The arrow shot

166
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,980
was Hua Xiao Zheng.

167
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,580
Xiao Zheng has repeatedly offended you.

168
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,760
I'm afraid she can't tolerate Xiao Zheng anymore.

169
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,480
But he chose to do this in my mansion

170
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,200
to frame me

171
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,720
or to remind me

172
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,160
that both adults

173
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,500
are both in danger.

174
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,410
What are you going to do?

175
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Since you don't want to be the Oiran,

176
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,560
let’s

177
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,340
her relationship with the Chamber of Commerce.

178
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,840
The four elders won’t hold a grudge

179
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,960
a woman.

180
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
Look at this. Look at this.

181
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,780
what about you?

182
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,860
It's never too late

183
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,090
It's never too late.

184
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
The assassin

185
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,320
When he heard your name,

186
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,920
he was so scared that he confessed everything.

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,040
Where did he

188
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
told him to assassinate you?

189
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,720
And...

190
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,530
How was the weather?

191
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
Even the color of the bag containing silver

192
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
the color of loading silver.

193
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,000
The Chamber of Commerce can't wait any longer.

194
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
I guess the assassins

195
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,820
who tried to kill me recently.

196
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,680
How is the assassin?

197
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
As you ordered,

198
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,080
we found a dead body

199
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,320
in the prison.

200
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,400
and said

201
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,060
he committed suicide while chasing him.

202
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,040
The other brothers escorted the assassin

203
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,640
and his family left the city.

204
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,930
The Chamber of Commerce can't find it.

205
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Xu Ziqi!

206
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,440
Xu Ziqi, go!

207
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,700
Go through the window.

208
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
What are you doing?

209
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,200
Well...

210
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,650
I'm going out for a walk.

211
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,280
See if my wound is healed.

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,440
Is your wound better?

213
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,840
Is my wound better?

214
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,440
What's wrong?

215
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,680
It hurts.

216
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,560
It hurts.

217
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Go back to your room and rest.

218
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Take care.

219
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,440
Be careful.

220
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,040
It hurts.

221
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Does it hurt a lot?

222
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,680
Will it take you a long time to recover?

223
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
About...

224
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,960
about ten days and a half months.

225
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,690
Only ten days and a half months.

226
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,080
When you recover,

227
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,720
Are you leaving the mansion?

228
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
My heart hurts.

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,440
My heart hurts.

230
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,040
You know that

231
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I like you.

232
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,300
What about now?

233
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,160
Now you know

234
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,200
Now

235
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
you know.

236
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,810
I know about the separation of hatred.

237
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,440
Now,

238
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,920
I have only one way.

239
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,800
I can only chase you.

240
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
You have to reply.

241
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,800
I...

242
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,490
I've never been in a relationship.

243
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm a girl.

244
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,360
I have no experience.

245
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,160
Calm down.

246
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,200
I...

247
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,960
Zheng.

248
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,520
I can't breathe.

249
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,650
Don't stimulate me.

250
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,400
You...

251
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,960
You're usually so fierce.

252
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,329
I'm telling you something important.

253
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
Why are you so tired?

254
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,359
Am I?

255
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm not.

256
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,680
I'm not.

257
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,700
I was so tired just now.

258
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,200
Zheng.

259
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,640
Don't talk to me.

260
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
I need to calm down.

261
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,680
and think about life.

262
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,440
Stop it.

263
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm thinking about something serious.

264
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,240
There are a few questions

265
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,840
some questions first.

266
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,660
Look at this. Look at this.

267
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,160
Well...

268
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,170
Do you have an important position in the imperial court?

269
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,280
No.

270
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
Then,

271
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,880
Do you have a lot of money?

272
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
You know.

273
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,360
I'm so poor.

274
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,360
So you don't have any merits

275
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,280
you have no merits.

276
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
Isn't that enough?

277
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
Not enough.

278
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
Then...

279
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
Do you like me?

280
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,840
Do you

281
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,520
love me?

282
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
You're blushing.

283
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
So you do.

284
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,600
Even if you do,

285
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,480
You don't have a position or money.

286
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,720
I need to think about it.

287
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
You can chase him.

288
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,880
But it's a question

289
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,440
That's a problem.

290
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,480
Didn't you say

291
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,040
the most important feeling

292
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,760
when two people are together?

293
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,480
Sometimes there are exceptions.

294
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,960
Are you serious?

295
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,120
I mean,

296
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
I need money

297
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,240
and power.

298
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,400
Otherwise, I might not be able to catch up with you.

299
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,480
I think so.

300
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,640
Why do you talk so much about me?

301
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,840
It's another standard

302
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,160
another standard.

303
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,840
My situation is different.

304
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,250
What's the difference?

305
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
You're not human.

306
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,280
Or

307
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
can you think about it?

308
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,520
and try?

309
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,480
Then tell me.

310
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,480
How much money do I need to make?

311
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,010
How much time do you give me?

312
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,880
Just...

313
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,840
I'm rich.

314
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
and rich.

315
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,440
Time

316
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,530
The sooner, the better.

317
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,680
In that case,

318
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,600
I might as well rob the bank.

319
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,050
Robbing is not allowed.

320
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
Robbing is temporary.

321
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,250
You have to be rich forever.

322
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
That's a good idea.

323
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,520
I should think about

324
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,410
what kind of man I should marry.

325
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440
I like rich and powerful men.

326
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,660
Is there a problem?

327
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,660
Is it wrong for me to think for the rest of my life?

328
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,880
You didn't even try to pursue me.

329
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,780
What kind of attitude is that?

330
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
Your Excellency, Mr. Xu will lose for sure.

331
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,100
Have you given instructions?

332
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Yes.

333
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,570
Don't worry.

334
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,640
Hello, Madam.

335
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm not.

336
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,560
Hello, Madam.

337
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,440
Hello Madam

338
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,200
Hello Madam

339
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,720
Don't bow

340
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,040
Hello, madam.

341
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,210
My goodness.

342
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,840
Hello, madam.

343
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,880
Hello, Madam.

344
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,200
How is it, Xu?

345
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,200
See?

346
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,200
She's Mrs. Fang now.

347
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,300
Xiao Zheng hasn't agreed yet.

348
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,960
before she agrees.

349
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,280
without moral ethics.

350
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,540
No matter what you say,

351
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,330
Madam Fang's name has already been known.

352
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm just taking the initiative.

353
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,640
By then,

354
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,880
if he doesn't agree to your title,

355
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,970
and promised me,

356
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,440
Aren't you going to change

357
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,640
must be replaced.

358
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
Hello, Madam.

359
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm not.

360
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,440
Hello, Madam.

361
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm not.

362
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,280
Hello, Madam.

363
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,840
I'm not.

364
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,640
Hello, Madam.

365
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,600
I'm really not...

366
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,400
Hello, madam.

367
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
Stop yelling.

368
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,040
Hello, madam.

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,240
I'm not your wife.

370
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,280
Hello, madam.

371
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,280
Stop bowing.

372
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
Hello, madam.

373
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm really not...

374
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,160
Hello, madam.

375
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm really not your wife.

376
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,160
Hello, madam.

377
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,460
Stop calling me madam.

378
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,720
Zheng.

379
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,880
Answer the questions.

380
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,960
Add it to my family tree.

381
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,240
There are many things that need to be asked in detail.

382
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,170
The family book.

383
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,880
Miss Hua, what's your birth date?

384
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,280
Who else is in your family?

385
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,240
What does your family do?

386
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,200
Do you have any famous ancestors?

387
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Well...

388
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,360
Well...

389
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,480
You...

390
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,680
Madam!

391
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,960
Madam!

392
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Ms. Zheng.

393
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,960
Why are you fighting with this pillar?

394
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Come down and talk.

395
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,280
I'm not going.

396
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:03,960
Madam.

397
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,200
Forget about the family tree.

398
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,280
But now...

399
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
I'm not going to the ancestral tomb

400
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm not asking you to go to the grave.

401
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,280
It's for you to choose the tomb

402
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,200
buried together 100 years later.

403
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,720
Are you poisonous?

404
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
I'm not going.

405
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,520
Ms. Zheng.

406
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,040
The tomb of the house

407
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,440
It was a place

408
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,400
from the royal family 200 years ago.

409
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,680
is on the side of the Dragon Vein.

410
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
It's a rare opportunity.

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,960
Bury yourself if you want.

412
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,360
I'm young and beautiful.

413
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
Why should I choose a cemetery?

414
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,170
It's not your cemetery.

415
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,520
It's our cemetery.

416
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,120
Xiao Zheng, you were born as a family.

417
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,730
and died as a haunted house.

418
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,880
Do you feel

419
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,280
my feelings?

420
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,840
You died before I agreed.

421
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,400
That's scary.

422
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:46,960
Okay.

423
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,760
I'll change a way you can accept.

424
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,400
Be normal. I don't ask for anything.

425
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,200
Please be normal.

426
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,440
Separation hatred asked you how.

427
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
You answered him.

428
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Doesn't that mean

429
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,120
there's still room for you to develop.

430
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,450
Then why am I still here?

431
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
Why don't I make room for you two?

432
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,680
Sorry.

433
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,530
I never loved any woman.

434
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,160
You're the first one.

435
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,240
Xiao Zheng.

436
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,040
I was rude.

437
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,000
Come down.

438
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,050
Don't come over.

439
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
If you follow me, I'll bite you.

440
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,160
At the speed of the bang,

441
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
when she walked to the second pillar,

442
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,680
I can meet her when I go out.

443
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,970
Why are you running so fast?

444
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,000
Xu Ziqi, where are you going?

445
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,280
Xu Ziqi!

446
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,090
Where are you going?

447
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,480
You haven't recovered yet.

448
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm leaving, Mrs. Fang.

449
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,260
Why should I stay here?

450
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
Am I in a high position?

451
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
My family is rich?

452
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,120
Indeed.

453
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,530
Brother Xu is innocent.

454
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,850
He's a man of honour.

455
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,960
is not as wealthy as my family.

456
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
It's worth a lot of money.

457
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,200
Xu, are you leaving?

458
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,480
I'll see myself out.

459
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,680
Yang Lin, prepare a sedan chair for him.

460
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
Brother Xu hasn't fully recovered.

461
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Yes.

462
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,730
Don't let him work too hard.

463
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Separate hatred.

464
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,980
You said he hasn't recovered yet.

465
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,680
How could you let him go?

466
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Madam.

467
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
Brother Xu is leaving.

468
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,160
He must be busy.

469
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,760
How can we stop him?

470
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,520
I said I'm not your wife.

471
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,120
If you call me madam again, I'll beat you up.

472
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,960
Shy

473
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,360
I'm shy.

474
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,880
I...

475
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,010
Yang Lin.

476
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,440
I...

477
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,200
Prepare the sedan.

478
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,720
Okay.

479
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,120
No need. I'll go by myself.

480
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,840
Goodbye, Brother Xu.

481
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,850
Goodbye, Lord Xu. Come again another day.

482
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,760
Xu Ziqi.

483
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,880
Xu Ziqi.

484
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,560
Isn't this the way to escape?

485
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,200
When I was holding you

486
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,340
Why can't I make it?

487
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,960
I...

488
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,000
You have no idea

489
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,200
how hard I used

490
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,480
to hold that pillar.

491
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,500
Four or five servants held me.

492
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
I wouldn't have recovered so soon.

493
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,170
Break away from hatred.

494
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,880
So,

495
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,440
you want to break free,

496
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,280
but you can't.

497
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Why are you following me?

498
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,200
Well...

499
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,280
I...

500
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,280
just want to ask you

501
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Will you work hard to make money?

502
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,480
You don't have to make that fast.

503
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,880
Let's talk.

504
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,240
Is this the first day you know me?

505
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
If my goal

506
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,080
is to be rich,

507
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm full.

508
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,720
I've donated so many properties

509
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,780
from my ancestors.

510
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm full.

511
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,640
I don't want to inherit the title of the family.

512
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,400
I just want to

513
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,960
be a delinquent

514
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
and live my life in peace.

515
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,140
You said you liked me and wanted to pursue me.

516
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,440
But liking and chasing are verbs.

517
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,480
You have to act, not just saying.

518
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,640
So you're giving up

519
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,680
because I pursued you?

520
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,120
In that case,

521
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,200
the goal of life

522
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,840
I choose my life goal.

523
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,360
You...

524
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,360
Miss Zheng.

525
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Listen to me.

526
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,600
This heart

527
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
can only be given to one person.

528
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,840
Although Lord Xu loves you,

529
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,440
but he's gone.

530
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,640
Look at Lord Fang.

531
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,120
is devoted to you.

532
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,900
If you want your marriage to go smoothly,

533
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Well...

534
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,020
be single-minded.

535
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,600
Yes, Zheng.

536
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,240
Brother Xu is leaving.

537
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,880
Why don't we go back to the mansion

538
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,680
and discuss how to be

539
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,880
the normal couple you mentioned, okay?

540
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm not going.

541
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,940
Xiao Zheng.

542
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,640
Miss Xiao Zheng.

543
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,880
From now on, not only the house,

544
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,920
but also your home.

545
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,640
Yes.

546
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,120
It's our home.

547
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,040
Yes, your home.

548
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,680
I'll leave.

549
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,040
Goodbye, Brother Xu.

550
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,920
Don't go.

551
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,720
I dragged him back because I have something to tell him.

552
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,320
What is it?

553
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,120
How to get rich?

554
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,420
I don't want to be rich.

555
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
No, you do.

556
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:12,840
I...

557
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,210
You must think about it.

558
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,420
Enough, Lord Fang.

559
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,520
Miss Xiao.

560
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,280
Let's go.

561
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,440
Let's go.

562
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,760
Let's go.

563
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,240
My lord.

564
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,520
The tea and dessert are ready.

565
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,840
Please go in.

566
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,600
Now that I think about it,

567
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,200
I've done

568
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,640
you taught me before.

569
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,980
Being rich is just a piece of work.

570
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,200
Since you said you wanted to show your true heart,

571
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,960
I think

572
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,480
love

573
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
is really bitter.

574
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,000
But even so,

575
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
I tried my best.

576
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,240
Why didn't she agree

577
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
to be with me?

578
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,520
Was your love for me a lie?

579
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,760
It's too sad to say that.

580
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,440
In the past,

581
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,440
I was just worried about my mother. I was worried about her.

582
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
and the House of Light.

583
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,220
Although life is hard,

584
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,060
I still have a goal.

585
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,220
Now that I met Hua Xiaochi,

586
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,960
everything has changed.

587
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Suddenly I feel

588
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
life is so complicated.

589
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,760
My lord.

590
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,760
You used to

591
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,400
dealt with officials.

592
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,960
Money for money.

593
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,680
It's all for money.

594
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,290
This is the easiest thing in the world.

595
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,720
And love

596
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,640
doesn't distinguish right from wrong.

597
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,900
Sincerity doesn't matter how long it is.

598
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
the first problem.

599
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,940
All right, my lord.

600
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,040
Let's not talk about this.

601
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,880
Let's go in.

602
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,280
Mr. Xu and Ms. Li are waiting for you.

603
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,440
Please.

604
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,960
This...

605
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,960
is Tang's water transport map.

606
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,360
If you want to make money,

607
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,840
business is the fastest way.

608
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,730
Since the founding of Tang,

609
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,650
the transport of Sui Dynasty has been developed.

610
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,260
Now we can communicate between the South and the North.

611
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,480
daily necessities,

612
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,920
Medicine, jewelry,

613
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,260
These five are the most influential.

614
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,120
The difference between the South and the North can be dozens of times.

615
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,720
If you work with the Carp Alliance,

616
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,970
within three years,

617
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,360
in less than three years.

618
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,480
This is amazing.

619
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,480
Xu Ziqi is reliable.

620
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,660
I'll work with you.

621
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,880
But there's a condition.

622
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
What is it?

623
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,210
It's a merchant registration.

624
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,280
Business registration?

625
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,860
Only when you enter the merchant register can you do business.

626
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,820
Actually, I don't understand

627
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,720
why the merchant register is considered a lowly person.

628
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,050
You make money with your skills and brain.

629
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,820
What's there to be looked down on?

630
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,720
Businessmen don't rely on hard work.

631
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,040
Second, they have no knowledge of sages.

632
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,960
It depends on

633
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,960
by some means.

634
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
and earn money

635
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,200
the hard-earned money.

636
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,720
Businessmen

637
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,620
is not fair and square.

638
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,840
Only a rich family

639
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,770
and no noble character.

640
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,560
So...

641
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,320
You think so too?

642
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,920
Yes.

643
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
Separate hatred.

644
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,159
Maybe the way a businessman used to do business is wrong.

645
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,719
to leave a bad impression.

646
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,639
If someone enters the business register,

647
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,520
and changes the bad business behavior,

648
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,580
Maybe people will change their opinions on merchants.

649
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,639
No.

650
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,239
All these years in the Chamber of Commerce,

651
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,699
I only realized one thing.

652
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,290
No businessman is evil.

653
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,980
I have something to do.

654
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
You can leave now.

655
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,960
Well...

656
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,920
Kuang, let's go.

657
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,040
But...

658
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,140
I want to be a merchant.

659
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,520
Ms. Zheng.

660
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,520
Don't say that.

661
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,400
Kuang.

662
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
Think carefully before you speak.

663
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,240
Yes.

664
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,920
I've thought about it for a long time.

665
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,180
I want to be a merchant.

666
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,120
Since I saw some ways of the Chamber of Commerce,

667
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,780
I've been very dissatisfied.

668
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,320
I wanted to fight them.

669
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,360
and thought about what to do.

670
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,760
I just didn't expect to enter a merchant register.

671
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,640
It may be a lowly identity

672
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,920
to many people.

673
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,800
But I believe if I really

674
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,360
in the right way,

675
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,840
you can change it.

676
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,560
This

677
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,440
once in my life.

678
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,860
You can't enter a merchant register.

679
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,960
Why?

680
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,090
Because you're my future wife.

681
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,760
I don't want to see you

682
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
to be looked down

683
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,360
despised by others.

684
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,730
Separating hatred.

685
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,080
You are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

686
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
We can work hard for this.

687
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
You have to believe

688
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,920
if you do the right thing,

689
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,360
you'll get a good result.

690
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,040
I did a lot of bad things before.

691
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,240
I also realized

692
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,560
in the process of being the Oiran.

693
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
I want to be

694
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,960
who can help others.

695
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,560
We can develop

696
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,840
what the people need.

697
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,080
at a cheap price.

698
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,760
Isn't this something a good businessman

699
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
can do?

700
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Are you asking me if I look down on merchants?

701
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,760
I'm telling you now.

702
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,690
I'm not looking down on you.

703
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,920
I hate you.

704
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,840
Come with me.

705
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,800
Miss Xiao.

706
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Take a good look at this family tree.

707
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,370
Master was a second-rank official

708
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,840
a second-rank official.

709
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,040
to assist the Emperor

710
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,440
and improve the people.

711
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,120
and be respected by the people.

712
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,480
You were once the best student in the Imperial Education Bureau.

713
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,160
He devoted himself to the imperial exam.

714
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,440
With your talent,

715
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,000
you should have made a name in the imperial examination.

716
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,120
and become an official.

717
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,360
and serve the court.

718
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,720
But

719
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,120
once his family was destroyed,

720
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,360
my parents were exiled to the border.

721
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,960
I was left in Chang'an as a hostage.

722
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
as a hostage.

723
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,650
To suppress me completely,

724
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,840
I was banished into a merchant register.

725
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,640
I studied hard since I was young.

726
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,260
But because I was demoted,

727
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
I was disqualified to take the civil examination.

728
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,720
and was expelled from the Imperial Education Bureau.

729
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,180
and can never enter again.

730
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,480
I want to realize my ambition

731
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,130
to realize my ambition.

732
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,280
You're demoted to a merchant and can't ride horses for a lifetime.

733
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,320
I used to be a young man

734
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,960
in Chang'an.

735
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,880
Now,

736
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,360
Do you think I like

737
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,120
in a luxurious sedan?

738
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,930
That's a cage to trap me.

739
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,760
But I have to

740
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,360
pretend that everything is normal.

741
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,300
Because if I don't take the sedan,

742
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,480
I have to walk.

743
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,840
I lost

744
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,720
my last bit of dignity.

745
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,480
can only

746
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
in the crowd.

747
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,960
It's a great honor.

748
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,360
The biggest stain in my life

749
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,320
in my life.

750
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,960
I tried my best

751
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,530
to get rid of this identity.

752
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,600
And you, Hua Xiaochi,

753
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,600
my future wife

754
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,360
is going to be a merchant.

755
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,440
Li.

756
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,560
Everyone says

757
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,960
I want to get rid of my son of a sinner.

758
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,480
No.

759
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,380
I never thought my father was guilty.

760
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,400
I love my father.

761
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,640
To my father.

762
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,140
What I really want to get rid of

763
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,940
is the identity of a merchant.

764
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,800
I was looked down upon by the merchant.

765
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,220
and I've been in darkness.

766
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,080
and fell into hell.

767
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,520
Zheng.

768
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,840
Do you remember

769
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
the day the Oiran went on the street?

770
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
You told me

771
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
you would protect me.

772
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,960
If you really want to protect me,

773
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,720
if you really want to protect me.

774
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,080
Because I don't want to see the person I love the most.

775
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,240
My future wife

776
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,440
has the identity

777
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,160
I hate the most.

778
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
Separate hatred.

779
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,080
I'm sorry.

780
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,540
I didn't know I was a merchant.

781
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,960
hurt you so much.

782
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,320
I can understand

783
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,360
I totally understand.

784
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,540
Because it's too hard for you.

785
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,640
I don't want you to carry on with your identity.

786
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,080
But...

787
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,420
Separating hatred

788
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,160
It's your way to get rid of the trade registration.

789
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,820
Entering merchants is my way.

790
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,520
This is the only way in Chang'an.

791
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,080
in Chang'an.

792
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,480
It may not be as big

793
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,520
as big as you.

794
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,890
But there's something I want to do.

795
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,680
I hope you can understand me.

796
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,920
Zheng.

797
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,170
Do you care about me?

798
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,440
Why do you want to be a merchant?

799
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
Have you ever thought about our future?

800
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,160
Have you ever thought about our future?

801
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,440
The second thing I want to tell you

802
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,960
I'm Hua Xiaochi.

803
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,490
I'm not someone's attachment.

804
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,240
Everyone in Chang'an knows that

805
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,560
I've proposed to you.

806
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,410
Are you going to break off the engagement?

807
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,000
But...

808
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,960
But after thinking about it these days,

809
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,080
I can't make up my mind to marry you.

810
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,760
Why?

811
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,650
It's because of Xu Ziqi, right?

812
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,530
It's not because of Xu Ziqi.

813
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,620
It's because we have different choices.

814
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,520
Okay.

815
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,520
Let's take our time.

816
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,640
Join the trade register won't solve anything.

817
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,580
Let's think of another way, okay?

818
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,760
Ms. Zheng.

819
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,760
Stop it.

820
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,240
I'll tell

821
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,760
about the rest.

822
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,280
The sedan chair of the Chamber of Commerce is ready.

823
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,210
The Grand Elder is waiting for you.

824
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,080
Don’t delay.

825
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,440
Leave it to me.

826
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,360
Forget it.

827
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,250
I've said everything I need to say.

828
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,840
Ms. Zheng.

829
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,760
What you just said

830
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,760
is too shocking to adults

831
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,420
Adults need some time now.

832
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,720
He can't accept you as a merchant.

833
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,840
But now,

834
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,970
you rejected his proposal.

835
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,720
What do you want him to do?

836
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,040
If I don't tell him now,

837
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,340
Should we drag this on?

838
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,240
I'm harming him.

839
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,380
Do you understand?

840
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,480
Lord Xu.

841
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:17,960
please

842
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,440
please persuade my lord.

843
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,720
I need to go to the Chamber of Commerce with him.

844
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Please, Mr. Xu.

845
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,410
You need to ask him what the divorce is.

846
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,200
He has to understand two things.

847
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,040
First,

848
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,400
I don't care if I become his wife or not.

849
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,120
Second,

850
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,560
I didn't say I want to be his wife.

851
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,440
Then...

852
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,480
What a pity.

853
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,280
He is in a high position.

854
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,880
He's rich.

855
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Say that again.

856
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,880
I was wrong.

857
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,060
I must enter the business registration.

858
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,160
This is my job.

859
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,880
Then do it.

860
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,720
Forget about other things.

861
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,400
I still support you on this.

862
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Okay, let's do it together.

863
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,570
Let's be rich together.

864
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,280
Xiao Zheng.

865
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,880
Being an official makes a fortune

866
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,880
is not my pursuit of life.

867
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,760
I don't want to change myself.

868
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Just like I don't want to change you.

869
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,400
You want Fang Li to take down the Chamber of Commerce with you.

870
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,160
As you know,

871
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,730
the Chamber of Commerce does evil things.

872
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,920
If he falls into it,

873
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,720
he'll only get deeper and deeper.

874
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,980
Will you force him to join hands with you?

875
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,760
No.

876
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,960
Why?

877
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,180
Because I'm not a separation.

878
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,490
I've never walked the path he took.

879
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,160
Why didn't you force him?

880
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,290
Why did you force me?

881
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,120
You...

882
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,600
You're so insincere in pursuing me.

883
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,880
I...

884
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,160
I can't explain it to you, right?

885
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,240
I can't pursue you

886
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,300
I can't pursue you.

887
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,560
Yes, you must be an official.

888
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,600
You must be rich.

889
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,460
Be an official and make a fortune.

890
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,440
You...

891
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,160
Don't push me.

892
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,900
You can jump over the wall if you're anxious.

893
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
What do you mean?

894
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,620
I learned something from you.

895
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,850
I thought it was unreasonable.

896
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,160
At this moment and here,

897
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,620
I think we can give it a try.

898
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:45,960
What?

899
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,680
I'm so mad.
