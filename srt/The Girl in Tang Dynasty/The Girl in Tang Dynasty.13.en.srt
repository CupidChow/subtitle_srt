1
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Miss Jin'er.

2
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,960
Have you seen Hua Xiao Zheng?

3
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
What's going on?

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Where is he?

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,240
Maybe he's still preparing.

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,960
Everyone.

7
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
please calm down.

8
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,200
In that case,

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,040
let's welcome

10
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,800
Gu Jin'er,

11
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,920
the Oiran Gu Jin'er

12
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,320
to perform for us.

13
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,760
OK.

14
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,160
Look at me. Look at me.

15
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,320
I am

16
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,170
You're the most beautiful woman in Chang'an. You're right.

17
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,960
Great! Great!

18
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,970
Good. Good. Good. Good.

19
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
Come on. Come on.

20
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
Great!

21
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,520
Now let's welcome

22
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
to the stage.

23
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay.

24
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,640
Let's welcome Ms Hua Xiaochi.

25
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Everyone,

26
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,920
Miss Hua Xiaochi hasn't arrived yet,

27
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,290
according to the rules,

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,800
the winner is

29
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,120
Hua Xiaochi is here.

30
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,760
Brother.

31
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,850
You're here just like that?

32
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,330
How inappropriate!

33
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's applaud for Ms Hua Xiaochi.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,680
Okay.

35
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,120
Come on.

36
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,180
Let's go. Let's go.

37
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,560
I want you to see

38
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
the familiar Chang'an.

39
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,570
At the same time,

40
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
Chang'an will surprise you.

41
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
How can it be big?

42
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,120
What is this

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,960
It's like a shadow. It's like a shadow.

44
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,820
shadow puppet.

45
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't lie to me.

46
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,700
I've seen puppets before.

47
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,000
This isn't a shadow puppet, right?

48
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
No.

49
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,880
What is this?

50
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Yeah.

51
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,440
Zheng is great!

52
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,880
Okay.

53
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,640
Great!

54
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,320
Well said.

55
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Not bad.

56
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
A living person.

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Okay.

58
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,960
Look.

59
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
Ex-sister-in-law.

60
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,180
Don't call me that.

61
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,440
Hua Xiaotong

62
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,440
Hua Xiaotong

63
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Thank you.

64
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Thank you.

65
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,240
Hua Xiaotong

66
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,320
Hua Xiaotong Hua Xiaotong

67
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Hua Xiaotong

68
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
Every day I ask myself

69
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
what is the beauty

70
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
I want to express?

71
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,640
I think if the Oiran represents beauty,

72
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,320
it's better to have fun alone.

73
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,680
The joy

74
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,440
is the joy of the Tang Dynasty.

75
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,000
Well said!

76
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,640
Great!

77
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,360
Tang not only needs

78
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,320
who represents the world,

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
who represents the world

80
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,559
who represents ordinary people.

81
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
Because Chang’an

82
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,200
is formed by every citizen.

83
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
That makes sense.

84
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,480
In my heart,

85
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,440
the sun, moon and stars are beautiful.

86
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,320
Flowers and plants are beautiful.

87
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,650
Everything in the world

88
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,560
is beautiful

89
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,200
is beautiful.

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,660
This is the beauty of the Oiran I understand.

91
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,860
The beauty of Chang'an

92
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,440
is also the beauty of Tang.

93
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
Good.

94
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Well said.

95
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,080
Good.

96
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,560
Hua Xiaochi

97
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,440
Well said.

98
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
Your ex-sister-in-law is good.

99
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Don't call me that.

100
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,440
Hua Xiaochi is good

101
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
He's really good.

102
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,800
The clothes

103
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,440
Not bad.

104
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,320
Hua Xiaotong

105
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
Hua Xiaotong Hua Xiaotong

106
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
Hua Xiaotong

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,480
Boss

108
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Remember to go up and propose

109
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,650
Come on, come on, come on

110
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,650
Remember it.

111
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,220
I have the deed with me.

112
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
When I went out this morning,

113
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,720
I had a stretch.

114
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,220
I'm afraid I can't run fast when chasing.

115
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,840
Great!

116
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,840
Everyone.

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,080
Now is the final vote.

118
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
Cheer up.

119
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Ten.

120
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,480
Nine.

121
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Seven.

122
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,960
Six.

123
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,560
Five.

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,920
Three.

125
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,440
Cut.

126
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,080
As you can see,

127
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,800
Now I announce

128
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
the winner of this year is

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
Hua Xiaochi.

130
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,960
Hua Xiaotong

131
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,680
Brother, look.

132
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
Go up, my lord. Go up.

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,480
Go up

134
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,200
Go!

135
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,080
Go! Go!

136
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,200
Boss, go!

137
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,440
After announcing that Miss Xiao Zheng is the new Oiran,

138
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,280
you'll go to the platform to propose.

139
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,560
Yes, go ahead.

140
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,330
How can I go on stage?

141
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,200
I'll fly over.

142
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,680
Sir.

143
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,920
You must fly over this time.

144
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,040
This is the only proposal in your life.

145
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,960
I'd rather be magnificent

146
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,080
Don't be stingy.

147
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah, go!

148
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,720
No!

149
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,800
This scene...

150
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,040
If I really fly up there,

151
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,440
that would be out of line.

152
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,880
Let me think about it.

153
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
I announce

154
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,800
In the first year of Shangyuan,

155
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,060
The winner of the Oiran of Chang'an is...

156
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Hua Xiaotong.

157
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,320
Hua Xiaotong

158
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,220
Congratulations.

159
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,320
It's okay.

160
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,720
Be careful.

161
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,840
Hua Xiaochi

162
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,130
Mind your waist.

163
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,200
Miss Jin'er.

164
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,650
Sister-in-law.

165
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,410
Congratulations, Madam Fang.

166
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Madam Fang.

167
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,340
Congratulations.

168
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,400
Great!

169
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,330
Xu Ziqi, what are you doing?

170
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,400
Well...

171
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,040
Protect Mr. Bang!

172
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
Protect...

173
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,040
Well...

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,290
You must become the housewife.

175
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,440
Before that,

176
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,200
should we

177
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,560
ask for your opinion?

178
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I'm not done yet.

179
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,370
If you agree to the psychological construction now,

180
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,680
It will take some time.

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,080
Xu Ziqi, you did a good job.

182
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
I have to find a way to avoid it.

183
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,160
I...

184
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,280
I think what you said makes sense.

185
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
I shouldn't have agreed so hastily.

186
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,040
I...

187
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,200
Mr. Zhang.

188
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Do you want to think about...

189
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,160
No need.

190
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
Our brother only loves Jin'er.

191
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Hero, you...

192
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,840
Don't you think about it?

193
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,280
Zheng.

194
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,600
Why do you hate Fang Li?

195
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Come back to the mansion with me.

196
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,800
I won't go back.

197
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Separate hatred.

198
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,960
Everyone, be on alert.

199
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,700
I'll protect Mr. Fang.

200
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,610
What's going on?

201
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,680
What are you doing here?

202
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
Protect Mr. Bang.

203
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Today is a good day.

204
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,560
It's okay.

205
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,170
One more person and one more celebration.

206
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
Let me pour some wine for you.

207
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,320
Here, Lord Xu.

208
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,720
Let's have a drink.

209
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,440
Let's talk about work.

210
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,680
As the Oiran,

211
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,160
What's your next job?

212
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,720
You can become the Oiran.

213
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,920
the Chamber of Commerce

214
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,400
There are a lot of troublemakers.

215
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,480
I understand.

216
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,960
Since I'm the Oiran of Tang now,

217
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,100
I will do something for the Chamber of Commerce.

218
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,440
Remember,

219
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,800
you are the Oiran of the Chamber of Commerce.

220
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
You are the Oiran of the Imperial Court.

221
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,800
not the Oiran of Tang.

222
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,800
So what exactly should I do?

223
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,200
The Chamber of Commerce

224
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,960
will show some tools to the people regularly.

225
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,560
and accessories.

226
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,680
Then I'm the Oiran.

227
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,200
I have the right to choose.

228
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,060
Remember this.

229
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,560
What does the Chamber of Commerce want to show the people

230
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,080
what the people can see.

231
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
You are their guide.

232
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,880
Forget it.

233
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,080
Since you're so happy today, let's not talk about work.

234
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,540
Let's have another drink.

235
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,440
Ms. Yang.

236
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,680
You should join us.

237
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,920
This...

238
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,760
Okay.

239
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Let's drink together.

240
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,880
Here.

241
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,680
Let's go. Let's go.

242
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Take a look. Here.

243
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Here.

244
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,720
Your eyes are really good.

245
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,640
You...

246
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,680
really my future husband?

247
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,200
Yes.

248
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
I need to check his real body.

249
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,680
My lord.

250
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,200
What are you doing?

251
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
Protect Mr. Bang.

252
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,440
You're so thoughtful, Lord Xu.

253
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,280
Lord Xu.

254
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,680
No.

255
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Don't let them stay in the same room.

256
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,840
Lord Xu, what are you doing?

257
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,020
Your lord is obviously drunk.

258
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,840
If they share a room,

259
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,240
it would be a disaster.

260
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
That makes sense.

261
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,360
Mr. Xu is so thoughtful.

262
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,490
Although I knocked myself out,

263
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,420
we can only last for one night.

264
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,200
The most important thing is to separate them as soon as possible.

265
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,060
We can never stay in the same room.

266
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,960
It'd be best if we could

267
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,680
to be closer to me.

268
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,440
Closer.

269
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
How can I get closer?

270
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,360
My neck.

271
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,200
Why does it hurt so much?

272
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,040
Lord Xu.

273
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,040
What are you doing?

274
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,040
There's a rebellion in Chang'an.

275
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,440
trying to mess up the Oiran and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

276
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,680
I came here to protect Mr. Bang.

277
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,840
Who dares to do this?

278
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,760
Chairman Bang, don't panic.

279
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,280
The thief is under the control of the delinquents.

280
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
Chang'an is understaffed.

281
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,040
So the security of the house

282
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,960
to the bros of the Koi Gang.

283
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,610
I've asked my superiors

284
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,960
to agree with

285
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
to join the security of the house.

286
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,360
Thank you for giving me the chance.

287
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
To be honest,

288
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,440
I always care about the world.

289
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,120
I want to uphold justice

290
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,440
and serve the court.

291
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
I've waited for more than ten years and finally got this chance.

292
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Brothers,

293
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,440
protect the house with me.

294
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,840
Protect the peace. Yes.

295
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,400
Yes.

296
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,880
Okay.

297
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,760
Then

298
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,920
What's going on? I'll leave it to Madam Zhang.

299
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,600
Make sure to guard carefully.

300
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,960
No one is allowed in.

301
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,040
To ensure Mr. Bang's safety,

302
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
in order to prevent any traitor in the house,

303
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,050
and no one is allowed to leave the mansion.

304
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,960
This...

305
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,960
Yes, sir.

306
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
Traitor.

307
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,040
I'll get back to work.

308
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,600
Goodbye, Lord Seo.

309
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Protect Mr. Bang.

310
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,680
Yes, sir.

311
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Protect Mr. Bang!

312
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
Protect Mr. Bang!

313
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,960
Slow down.

314
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,440
What happened?

315
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,640
There's a rebellion in Chang'an.

316
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,960
I'll protect you.

317
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,520
Come with me to a safe place.

318
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Didn't you say

319
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,850
that Zhang Gui-cai is safe in the mansion?

320
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,680
If the bandits break in,

321
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,200
we'll catch all of you.

322
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,440
Come with me.

323
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,440
Zheng.

324
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,540
What are you doing?

325
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,880
Put me down.

326
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,920
What's wrong?

327
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
Put me down!

328
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,260
Xiao Zheng!

329
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,600
Put it down!

330
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:27,960
Put me down.

331
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,920
Put her down.

332
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
Xu Ziqi, where are you taking me?

333
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,700
The safest place in Chang'an, of course.

334
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,480
Protect Mr. Bang.

335
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Protect Mr. Bang!

336
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,440
Separating hatred

337
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,880
Xiao Zheng.

338
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,640
Protect Mr. Bang!

339
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,200
Put me down!

340
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,640
Zheng!

341
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,440
Protect Mr. Bang.

342
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
Make sure to surround him.

343
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,160
I can't.

344
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,840
Zheng.

345
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,240
Push my lord

346
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,680
Zheng.

347
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,080
The water is not leaking.

348
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,160
This is the safest place

349
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,440
the safest place in Chang'an?

350
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,200
Yes.

351
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,840
The bandits are making trouble outside.

352
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Are you going out to get yourself caught?

353
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,500
There's a rebellion outside!

354
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,440
My lord,

355
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
what about our family?

356
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,600
Don't worry.

357
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,200
they are after the Oiran.

358
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,300
and Chairman Bang.

359
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Xu Ziqi.

360
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,600
Look at this.

361
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,200
A black and bright hair.

362
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,360
Under the dark and beautiful hair

363
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
My smart brain.

364
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,570
Do you think I'm stupid?

365
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
The bandits are making trouble.

366
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,640
There are so many bandits in Chang'an, but you didn't catch them.

367
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,680
but you held a grudge against me and Fang Li.

368
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,520
Tell me.

369
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,520
What thief?

370
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,200
So stubborn.

371
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,760
The milk cow you used for the milk tea competition

372
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,200
I pulled out the foreign fur’s village.

373
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,000
The Westerner hates you.

374
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,960
You pulled out the fortress.

375
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,220
Why would they hate me?

376
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,000
Besides,

377
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,880
do you speak the language with Westerner?

378
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,240
Don't you have to communicate before you fight?

379
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,680
before you fight.

380
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
I borrowed a cow.

381
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,440
You're still fighting with someone?

382
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,720
Are you stupid

383
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,240
or are you stupid?

384
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,960
I...

385
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
You can't go out right now.

386
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
Just stay here.

387
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I won’t leave the Oiran

388
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
in this prison.

389
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,460
in this prison.

390
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,000
Room 1 of T-subsidiaries.

391
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,960
Here.

392
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,720
Others are here to reflect on their mistakes.

393
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,250
You're here for a vacation.

394
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Look at this room.

395
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
I picked it for you.

396
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
Although the environment is a bit shabby,

397
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,600
but sitting north facing south

398
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,680
It's natural.

399
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,200
The lighting is good.

400
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,440
You didn't even lock the door.

401
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
You're free.

402
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Xu Ziqi.

403
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,440
Do you like me?

404
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,760
Yes, I do.

405
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,200
I like you.

406
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,600
Who would like you?

407
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,400
A woman like you

408
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,780
who flirts with girls.

409
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
Whoever marries you

410
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,680
will be unlucky for eight lifetimes.

411
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,640
I like you.

412
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,200
Do you think everyone in Chang'an

413
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,800
all men in the world like you?

414
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,340
It's best if you don't like me.

415
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,680
I don't like you either.

416
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,480
Don't like me.

417
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,440
If I like you, I'm a jerk.

418
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,200
I like you. I'm the bastard.

419
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Deal.

420
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,440
Deal.

421
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,400
Boss.

422
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,540
I've got the stuff. I'll put it on for you.

423
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,240
What are you doing?

424
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,000
There are too many bandits outside.

425
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,280
So I decided

426
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,280
stay here with you these days.

427
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,480
Xu Ziqi.

428
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,680
Are you too idle?

429
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,440
The dignified King of Hell is nothing.

430
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,280
As this lady said,

431
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,250
She does have a lot of free time.

432
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,040
Who is this

433
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,160
Newcomer.

434
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,680
You took money and injured him badly.

435
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,060
He has some skills.

436
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,330
He doesn't behave when he comes in.

437
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,160
Please spare me

438
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,960
How dare you!

439
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,640
Please spare my life!

440
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
Please spare my life.

441
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,440
My lord, I know I was wrong.

442
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,000
My lord.

443
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,400
I'll catch his limbs in three days.

444
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,000
How dare you be so arrogant with such little skills?

445
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,330
I'll give you a discount if he's arrogant.

446
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,160
until he repents.

447
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Your Excellency!

448
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,880
You're good, Lord Xu.

449
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,840
You finally became the Oiran.

450
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,480
Next, we need to use the identity of the Oiran

451
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,160
to make money and become a businessman.

452
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,880
What's the point of being trapped here?

453
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,520
Xu Ziqi.

454
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,280
Are you helping me?

455
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,720
or cheating me?

456
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,140
Sleepwalking.

457
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,100
Sleepwalking?

458
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,300
Sleepwalking?

459
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,280
This...

460
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,960
Run!

461
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,200
Xu Ziqi.

462
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
I escaped.

463
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Let me see the separation of hatred.

464
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,560
Don't fool me with the nonsense of foreigners.

465
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,000
Xu Ziqi.

466
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,760
I know you made up all the rebellions.

467
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,840
Why won't you let me leave you?

468
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,770
I just give you some time

469
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,520
to give you some time to think about it.

470
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,720
Calm down.

471
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,520
Think about how to be the Oiran.

472
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,500
Look at you.

473
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,900
You didn't stop at all.

474
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,840
I worked so hard

475
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,000
to become the Oiran.

476
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,240
You can arrest me as you like.

477
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,280
and let me think about it.

478
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,760
Do you want to be a wife in the mansion?

479
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,960
No.

480
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,040
Bring it here.

481
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,480
I won't eat it.

482
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
I...

483
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,640
I want to protect you.

484
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,200
I'm afraid you'll be impulsive.

485
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,260
It's not easy to be the Oiran of the Chamber of Commerce.

486
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
But I've made it clear.

487
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,680
When you become the Oiran, you have to listen to the Chamber of Commerce.

488
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,480
Cooperation will make you rich.

489
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
I want to be rich soon.

490
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Isn't that good?

491
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,880
People die for money.

492
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
birds die for food.

493
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,740
If the Chamber of Commerce

494
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
what will you do

495
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,930
what will you do?

496
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,760
No way.

497
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,240
Isn't the Chamber of Commerce a decent institution?

498
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,640
In a decent institution,

499
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,000
are not necessarily decent people.

500
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,200
Mr. Xu Ziqi.

501
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
Are you too nervous?

502
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
Don't worry.

503
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,239
I'm going to find a place.

504
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,320
Wait.

505
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Not now.

506
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:24,719
Go in.

507
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,920
Xu Ziqi, who are you to lock me up?

508
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,960
Report!

509
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,760
Mr. Xu, Mr. Fang is here.

510
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,000
He said he's here to visit Miss Li.

511
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,400
Let me out!

512
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,760
Go!

513
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,520
Xu Ziqi, let me out!

514
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,920
Do you hear me?

515
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,770
Can you leave me a crack?

516
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,730
How can I get out?

517
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,040
Make way.

518
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,520
Li.

519
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,240
Ziqi.

520
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,320
I feel

521
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,400
a murderous aura?

522
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,560
Calm down. I'm here.

523
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
No one dares to act recklessly.

524
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,800
The thief wouldn't dare to come here.

525
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,760
Of course.

526
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,040
Look how safe Xiao Zheng is here.

527
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,180
It's his first time in prison.

528
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,520
So I came to see

529
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,240
if she's used to living here.

530
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,040
I understand.

531
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,760
Please.

532
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,240
Wait.

533
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,440
What is this? Open it.

534
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,360
This...

535
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:46,960
No.

536
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,060
Freshly roasted roasted duck

537
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,320
The best braised beef.

538
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,320
Cherry Biluo.

539
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,170
This is the new rice dumplings from the Yu family.

540
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,000
Li.

541
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,040
Did you move

542
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,800
all the food in Chang'an?

543
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
For the sake of Zheng,

544
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,520
This is nothing.

545
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,960
These...

546
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,080
all these.

547
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,160
Why?

548
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,600
Afraid of poisoning?

549
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,330
Take it down.

550
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,570
I'll confiscate it.

551
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,040
Can we go now?

552
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,240
Wait.

553
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,320
What's wrong?

554
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,300
You need to take off your clothes.

555
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,600
According to the rules,

556
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
all visitors must be searched.

557
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
You've gone too far.

558
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,000
Yang Lin.

559
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,640
What is this?

560
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
It's a love letter.

561
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,600
I haven't seen you for a day.

562
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,760
I miss you very much.

563
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,120
You messed up the house.

564
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,960
You made my heart a mess.

565
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,560
Give it to me.

566
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,040
Li,

567
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,280
This is so cheesy.

568
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,760
Lord Xu.

569
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,320
You don't have to say it out loud.

570
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,800
According to the rules in the prison, you have to read and write a statement.

571
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,280
You don't have to read it so loud.

572
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,840
There are so many people here.

573
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,040
I had something to celebrate in my life.

574
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,080
[Summer Rain, Spring Wind]

575
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
Winter snow and I miss you

576
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,730
Are you done?

577
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,840
Can you give it back to me?

578
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,840
No.

579
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,760
I'm confiscating it.

580
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,320
Why?

581
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,600
According to the rules,

582
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,880
I'm afraid there will be codes between letters.

583
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,940
No communication.

584
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,000
Can I leave now?

585
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,240
Wait.

586
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,440
What now?

587
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,090
Take off the sharp weapon on your head.

588
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,400
Okay, you can go in now.

589
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,160
Brothers of the Carp Alliance,

590
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,960
Keep up.

591
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,480
Protect Mr. Bang.

592
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,440
He...

593
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,800
My lord.

594
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,440
Zheng.

595
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
You...

596
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,600
What are you doing?

597
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,960
Xiao Zheng, I'm here to see you.

598
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,570
Separating hatred.

599
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,120
Second Master is here to see you.

600
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,880
Second Master, raise your hand.

601
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,040
Here, here, here.

602
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,240
Look.

603
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,370
I saw the hand of the second master.

604
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,040
Zheng, are you okay?

605
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm fine except that I can't get out.

606
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,360
Can you get me out?

607
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,160
Why are you here?

608
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,080
Are you here to discuss business?

609
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,940
What business?

610
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,640
Famous prostitute.

611
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
No, I came to see you.

612
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,880
When you're not here,

613
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,560
the bros of the Carp Alliance

614
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,360
protected Mr. Bang very well.

615
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
Right, guys?

616
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,840
Yes.

617
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,960
Time's up.

618
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,480
Everyone, please leave.

619
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,080
Let's go.

620
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,700
Get out.

621
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,400
Time's up.

622
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,040
Separating hatred

623
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,800
Xiao Zheng.

624
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,800
Wait for me.

625
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,600
Wait for you.

626
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,440
Hurry up.

627
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,840
I'll get you out.

628
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,400
Li, it's time.

629
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,960
Don't let others say I'm being biased.

630
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Ziqi, no.

631
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,160
Lord Xu, there's a clear line between rewards and punishments.

632
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,420
How could he be biased?

633
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,960
Mr. Bang.

634
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,960
You're being naughty.

635
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,160
Xiao Zheng.

636
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,480
Reflect on yourself.

637
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,060
Xiao Zheng.

638
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,720
You must be bored these days.

639
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,290
Come out for some fresh air.

640
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,840
Here, Lord Xu.

641
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,690
How is Brother Zhang recently?

642
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,000
I think the bros of the Lucky Carp Alliance

643
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,880
are much stronger than before.

644
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Our eldest brother

645
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,880
has always wanted to serve the court.

646
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,560
But

647
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,720
I don't know why

648
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,240
I broke my leg.

649
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,520
I became a gang halfway.

650
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,160
But our boss said

651
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,280
people

652
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,320
Maybe

653
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,490
Maybe there's a chance.

654
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,330
Our brother is not an ordinary man.

655
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,800
Then who is your brother?

656
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,120
He's a pillar from heaven.

657
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,320
Let me tell you.

658
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,920
there is a big

659
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,840
in his chest.

660
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,850
The fortune teller said

661
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,560
it’s the trace of Wuqu Star descending to earth.

662
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,560
Zhusha mole.

663
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,000
What's wrong with you? Are you possessed?

664
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,880
Zheng, what's wrong?

665
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,160
I want to see him.

666
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,240
What?

667
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,420
I want to see Jang Gui-jae.

668
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,320
Right now! Right now!

669
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,880
Are you okay?

670
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,490
I'm going crazy.

671
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,120
Why isn't he here yet?

672
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,240
What else did he say?

673
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,920
I don't know.

674
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,440
She's like she's possessed.

675
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,300
Brother Zhang.

676
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,920
Brother Xu, you're here. You're here. Let's go. Let's go.

677
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,120
You're finally here.

678
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,040
This...

679
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,340
What happened?

680
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,120
Zheng, are you okay?

681
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,810
I heard from Yuanhan that you were possessed.

682
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,880
I have something to tell you.

683
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,840
You, go ahead.

684
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,520
You have to come closer.

685
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,320
I can only tell you.

686
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,320
Go. It's okay.

687
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,600
Go.

688
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,480
Zheng.

689
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,400
Go ahead.

690
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,960
It's not close. It's not close. It's not close.

691
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,800
Don't

692
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,440
what I said.

693
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,840
Zheng, don't worry.

694
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,440
I won't tell anyone

695
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,720
what you told me.

696
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,880
Miss Zheng,

697
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,880
You're a girl. You can't do this.

698
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,440
Hua Xiaochi, you're shameless!

699
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,640
First, you stripped off your clothes on the street.

700
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,600
Now he's in prison

701
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,800
in prison.

702
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,660
What are you doing?

703
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,060
Are you recalling?

704
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,440
Why didn't you take off my clothes

705
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,370
Why didn't you take my clothes off?

706
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah, you might have

707
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,800
for ten years.

708
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,440
I finally saw a girl picking flowers.

709
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,480
No wonder Lord Xu has to stay here day and night.

710
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,960
I guess

711
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,160
he's afraid that she'll tarnish our innocence.

712
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,660
Hua Xiao Zheng.

713
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,560
I won't let you out.

714
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,480
This...

715
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,640
Tell my son

716
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Don't let him go.

717
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,410
Otherwise, it's dangerous

718
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,960
is dangerous.

719
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,760
Yes.

720
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,160
Why is there another cinnabar mole?

721
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,120
Is there a hero?

722
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,840
My husband is not my husband.

723
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,520
Who could it be?

724
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,120
No, I have to get out.

725
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,250
I have to get out.

726
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,760
Let me out!

727
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,580
Brother Xu, take care.

728
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,520
Take care.

729
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,120
Let me out!

730
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,960
I have something urgent.

731
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,800
Something important.

732
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,040
My life.
