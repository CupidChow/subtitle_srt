1
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,800
The Western Market and East Market's commission can't be unified.

2
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,930
Such a stupid thing.

3
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,280
Why did you write a post for discussion?

4
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,360
The ruffians in the west market

5
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
must be out of their mind.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
He even wants to share equal treatment

7
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,540
with the local officials.

8
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,850
My lord. My lord.

9
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,560
It's itchy.

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Let me see.

11
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,140
This...

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,920
What happened?

13
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,240
Get a doctor.

14
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,960
My lord.

16
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,450
If you can't help it,

17
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Okay. Okay. Okay.

18
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Like this. Like this.

19
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,640
Look at my face.

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,090
What if I scratch it?

21
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,570
Why are you here?

22
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
Ms. Yang was looking for a doctor.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
I knew you were allergic

24
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,760
I knew you were allergic to flowers.

25
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,240
So I went to the ice cellar

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,290
and get some ice.

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Ice compress can relieve the itchy.

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,560
And this.

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,770
What is this?

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
This is...

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,480
for allergy.

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,890
It's from my family.

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,079
My lord.

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,560
It doesn't seem to be poisonous.

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,400
Why would I poison him?

36
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,170
Do you care about me?

37
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,960
My lord.

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,120
Hang in there.

39
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,079
Here.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,480
How is it?

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,800
Sir.

42
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,780
How do you feel?

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,960
It seems

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,360
It's not tickly. It's tickly. It's not tickly.

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,360
Look.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
You must be allergic to flowers.

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,240
My family grows flowers.

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,360
It's no big deal.

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
How did you

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
in the mansion today?

52
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,280
Why is Lord Fang allergic again?

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,450
Steward, calm down.

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,960
The flowers in the yard

55
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,640
were carefully selected.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
They won't let adults

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,560
allergic to it.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,440
This is...

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,079
All right.

60
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,120
These roses are very dangerous.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
You can't touch them.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,000
thorns.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,880
It's a bad omen.

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,440
Oh, right.

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
And Mr. Bang.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,520
The roses in front of the bedroom.

67
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,850
in front of the bedroom.

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,120
What are you waiting for?

69
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,980
Get rid of them!

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,080
Yes.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Let's go.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,320
Hurry.

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,810
Look carefully.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Ms. Yang.

75
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,200
These dangerous flowers

76
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,960
all these dangerous flowers

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,120
to my room.

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
After I deal with it,

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,260
after I take care of it.

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Sir.

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,480
What is it?

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
You saved my life.

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,450
What do you want?

84
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,800
It's nothing.

85
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,640
Don't worry about it.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,260
As long as you are safe,

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,000
as long as you are safe.

88
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm going to remove the flowers.

89
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
I finally did something.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
It's not that simple.

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,200
She

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,170
can save me in such a short time.

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,440
it means she's always

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,800
all the time.

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
and love me deeply.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,580
I really don't understand

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
the roses

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,440
is such a dangerous flower.

99
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,690
Put that over there.

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
It's business.

101
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm just poor in information.

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,880
Here too.

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,800
I've observed

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
the women in Chang'an

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,560
are mostly

106
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
to make flowers

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
decorations.

108
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
The value of flowers

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
There's also a lot of excavation space.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,860
The first step.

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,800
Give flowers

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
a special meaning.

113
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,080
Come on

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
Buy flowers.

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,560
Lucky and wealthy peony.

116
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,680
Everyone knows it.

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,960
Lily is a flower that brings happiness.

118
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,880
Whose girl is heartbroken by crying for love?

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
The interpretation of lovesickness

120
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,200
A red begonia will come.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,360
Wish love a happy ending.

122
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
A mountain tea.

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,080
The ideal love is by your side

124
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,240
With roses,

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
can attract

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,000
a special flower of love.

127
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,960
Girls,

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
Don't worry about your marriage.

129
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,200
Why is this bouquet

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
only one rose?

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,560
One represents one love

132
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,520
one and only love.

133
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,240
I see.

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,000
Then why

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,440
only one rose?

136
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
One mountain tea.

137
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,680
Two represents

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,320
One couple for life.

139
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,120
Let's fly in pairs.

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,880
Sure.

141
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
I want one too.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,680
Me too.

143
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Step two.

144
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Mix sales.

145
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,080
is to bind and sell.

146
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,240
In a reasonable way

147
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,300
in a reasonable way

148
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,560
to make the people buy more products voluntarily.

149
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
My lord was allergic to pollen

150
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,200
seven days ago.

151
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,560
He keeps sneezing.

152
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
Too many sneezes

153
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,000
I lost my energy.

154
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,080
so he stopped eating.

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm allergic.

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,120
Not passed away

157
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,900
I suddenly had an allergy.

158
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
This is very strange.

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,640
Where is that scourge?

160
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,440
A few days ago,

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,120
when Lord Tao was allergic,

162
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
she came to deliver medicine.

163
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,120
and ice.

164
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,120
Somehow,

165
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,240
she's gone.

166
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Are you allergic?

167
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,900
She'll give you the medicine.

168
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,640
to cure your illness.

169
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Every time.

170
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,100
Wind and electric switch.

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,200
How could she

172
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,320
your allergy time

173
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,560
is so accurate.

174
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,360
She...

175
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,820
She's a scoundrel.

176
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,680
One coin, two coins, three coins, four coins, five coins

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,120
Six coins, seven coins, eight coins

178
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,679
Nine coins. Ten coins.

179
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,960
How much

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,039
in this bag?

181
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,160
Zheng, you're great.

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,680
Be careful.

183
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,460
Mr. Bang, look.

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,960
I can make money.

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,440
Just make money.

186
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,480
What's wrong with our chairman?

187
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,920
I wrote it carefully.

188
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,280
about the flower shop in Chang'an.

189
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,340
Show it to Mr. Bang.

190
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,900
But Mr. Bang...

191
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,300
He's been ignoring me.

192
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Should I prove to the chairman

193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,890
to the president

194
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
I have the potential to do business

195
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
and brain.

196
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
I can work

197
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,460
with the chairman.

198
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Besides,

199
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
How did I hurt your chairman?

200
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,810
It's just a few sneezes.

201
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not hurt.

202
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
What are you doing?

203
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
Uncertified management.

204
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,500
Illegal business.

205
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,410
and confiscated all the money.

206
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,840
How is it illegal

207
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
How is it illegal?

208
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,620
Do you understand?

209
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,980
The rules are dead.

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
People are alive.

211
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
without evidence.

212
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,680
and disrupt the market order.

213
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,080
and affect social security.

214
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
This is a good thing

215
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,800
who pay the stall fees

216
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,680
is unfair.

217
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,320
Besides,

218
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,960
you hurt others' bodies.

219
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
for hurting others.

220
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Do you feel proud?

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,860
What can you prove?

222
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
People die for money.

223
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
for money?

224
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,200
Li,

225
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Can you agree

226
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
this way of making money?

227
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm just a helpless

228
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
and helpless.

229
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm different from you.

230
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,160
I worked so hard

231
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,680
because I have no way back.

232
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,620
Do you understand?

233
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,820
You have no way out now.

234
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,200
It's your fault.

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
You deserve it.

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,280
Great job, Lord Xu.

237
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Hit me.

238
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,680
Bastard!

239
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,290
No matter how hard it is,

240
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,930
and always make things difficult for others.

241
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,400
My lord.

242
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,200
Why are we out so late?

243
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,040
This scoundrel goes alone at night.

244
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,240
If anything happens,

245
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,720
it's on my house.

246
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
It's better to be careful.

247
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,740
You're so thoughtful.

248
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,680
But sir,

249
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,160
What should we do?

250
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,620
Lift the sedan chair forward.

251
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,840
and go with her.

252
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,280
Yes.

253
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,080
This way, it'll be safer.

254
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,080
Why are you following me?

255
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

256
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Our house

257
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,000
can't take the responsibility.

258
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,200
I want to be alone.

259
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,420
Leave me alone.

260
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,160
Look.

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,960
Playing hard to get again.

262
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,420
My lord.

263
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
What should we do?

264
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Let's play along.

265
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
Lift the sedan chair forward.

266
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
She will definitely stop us.

267
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,200
Speed up.

268
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,960
Surpass her!

269
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,260
Yes, Young Master.

270
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,380
Hurry up, you guys.

271
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,440
Husppy

272
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,480
Is she panicking?

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,800
My lord.

274
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,480
She didn't react at all.

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,200
She walks with her head down.

276
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
You're trying to get me off the sedan

277
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,970
Let me off the sedan.

278
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,160
This woman does have a plan.

279
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,440
This is a psychological war.

280
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Keep going.

281
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
She can't wait to catch up.

282
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,860
My lord.

283
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,160
There's a turn. Okay.

284
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,820
Then slow down.

285
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,960
There are so many people carrying it. Why are you walking so slowly?

286
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,690
How can I cry if you don't leave?

287
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm fine.

288
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
You guys go first.

289
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,160
My lord.

290
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,490
She was crying just now.

291
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,800
Why did she laugh?

292
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,960
This is the 36 strategies.

293
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,780
Never compromise.

294
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,200
Keep going.

295
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,840
Is the chassis unstable?

296
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,620
Why are you walking so slowly?

297
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,440
My lord.

298
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,800
She's squatting now.

299
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,920
Stop.

300
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,440
My lord.

301
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,480
She's crying.

302
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,040
Let's go back.

303
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Find someone to protect her.

304
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,800
Don't let her find out.

305
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,320
Yes.

306
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Why are you here?

307
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,880
All right.

308
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,280
I know I made you allergic.

309
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,280
and took the flowers in your house.

310
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,080
It's my fault.

311
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,840
I apologize.

312
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,280
But I'm really tired today.

313
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,320
Can you scold me tomorrow?

314
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,140
I didn't mean to scold you.

315
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,400
Are you chasing me away?

316
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,720
Can I go tomorrow?

317
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm not trying to kick you out.

318
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,290
Then what are you doing?

319
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,560
Are you going to kill me to silence me?

320
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:33,960
What

321
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,480
thinking about every day.

322
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,160
I just heard you cry so sadly.

323
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,960
So

324
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,560
to see you.

325
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,200
You don't blame me

326
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,080
or angry with me.

327
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,200
I know.

328
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,850
You wanted to pretend to cry

329
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,410
to make me soft-hearted

330
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
and let me get off the sedan to comfort you.

331
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,200
But I didn't expect

332
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,170
to leave you on the night

333
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,040
and made you cry so sadly.

334
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,280
But...

335
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,020
it's late at night.

336
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,020
I was thoughtless.

337
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,680
So I came to explain to you.

338
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,720
I know.

339
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
you are like other women.

340
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,320
like other women.

341
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,800
and wanted to marry me.

342
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
But compared to other women,

343
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
with other women,

344
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,720
more eager.

345
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,090
Playing hard to get.

346
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
and pretend to want to learn.

347
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,380
the way of business

348
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
to me.

349
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,760
You poisoned me with pollen.

350
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,280
You want to help me

351
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
and let me accept you?

352
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Wait, mister.

353
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,080
I...

354
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,960
I know.

355
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,840
I expose you

356
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,720
expose you,

357
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,660
you must defend yourself.

358
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
You don't have to.

359
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,160
You don't have to

360
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Don't bother.

361
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,440
You can tell me frankly.

362
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,960
you love me.

363
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,400
You can't get rid of me.

364
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,440
You...

365
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,860
What are you doing?

366
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,730
You need to be rough.

367
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,040
and force me to yield.

368
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,320
Separate hatred.

369
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,840
You are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

370
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
What are you thinking about?

371
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,530
Can't you focus on your career?

372
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
I get up early and work hard

373
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,960
I work hard to get rich.

374
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,260
What about you?

375
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
always

376
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
all day long.

377
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,680
The 36 strategies

378
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
are all used for lust and imagination.

379
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,040
I talk about business with you.

380
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,570
You talk about love with me.

381
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,860
Listen carefully.

382
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,200
I tried so hard to get into your house

383
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,330
to do something big.

384
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,320
If you keep

385
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,280
like this,

386
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,080
I don't need you to kick me out.

387
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,410
I'll stay away from you.

388
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,330
Understand?

389
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,140
Don't make me despise you.

390
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,500
Do you understand?

391
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,560
You bastard!

392
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Oh no.

393
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,640
I'm sorry.

394
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,040
Why did he have to

395
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
at a time like this.

396
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,480
if you say that.

397
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,839
If you keep this up,

398
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,740
Am I really going to find another one?

399
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:35,960
Li.

400
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,800
Where's the trouble?

401
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,300
Last night,

402
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
He ran away from home.

403
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,960
She cried a lot and came back.

404
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,000
Why is she crying?

405
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,490
She cried all night.

406
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,640
No.

407
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,200
Well...

408
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I was walking on the street late at night.

409
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,980
and refused to go home.

410
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,200
What a disaster.

411
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,900
How could someone do this?

412
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,860
disregarding the law.

413
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Shameless!

414
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,240
You hurt others and yourself.

415
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,280
and selfish.

416
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes.

417
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Why is someone

418
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,480
One in front of others.

419
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,540
One after another.

420
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,520
It's only right to say things wrong.

421
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,050
Exactly.

422
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,720
What a trouble.

423
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,280
Scared?

424
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
A demon?

425
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
Monster?

426
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,640
I heard that

427
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,000
there is a demon in the mountain.

428
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,260
It can bewitch people.

429
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,200
Look.

430
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,530
All the servants

431
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,530
all the servants

432
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,200
Except Husppy,

433
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Yang Lin and me,

434
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,730
are all close to her.

435
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,440
It makes sense

436
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,200
makes sense.

437
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,360
If not a demon,

438
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,160
you wouldn't have been able to do that in such a short time.

439
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,200
make so much money

440
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
in such a short time.

441
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,240
It's a magic trick. You're right. You're right.

442
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,640
You're right. Let's go. Let's go.

443
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,000
Look.

444
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,200
The money on her desk

445
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,520
is not a small amount

446
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
is not a small amount.

447
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,400
However,

448
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,940
it's easy to deal with a human.

449
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,040
A demon.

450
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,410
What should I do?

451
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,360
be bewitched by her?

452
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
and marry her?

453
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
I saw her sad.

454
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,490
I actually had compassion.

455
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
Ziqi, what about you?

456
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,440
I...

457
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,600
I feel bad too.

458
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,480
But it doesn't matter.

459
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,210
Justice is in people's hearts.

460
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,000
To me,

461
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,090
she just wants me to be with her.

462
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,400
I'm afraid

463
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,440
for you.

464
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
She has cut me

465
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,860
for the rest of my life.

466
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,890
Monster!

467
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,720
Evil!

468
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,240
Boss.

469
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,560
King of Hell's secret lover.

470
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,480
But suddenly,

471
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,920
a man in black outside the window

472
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,240
stabbed King of Hell.

473
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
but changed his move in the middle.

474
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,960
and captured King of Hell's lover.

475
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
The lover couldn't bear King of Hell being threatened.

476
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,340
Hengdao will commit suicide.

477
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
He said it was too late, but it was fast.

478
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,240
The King of Hell cut out his sheath.

479
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,280
and chopped the villain

480
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,680
and the knife in his lover's hand.

481
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,920
Then King of Hell

482
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,520
held his lover.

483
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
and roar loudly.

484
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
Silly girl.

485
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,200
Don't hurt yourself

486
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,840
hurt yourself like this.

487
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,720
I can't live without you.

488
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,960
Tonight,

489
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,200
leave me tonight.

490
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
I want the moon in the city

491
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,120
fall for you and me.

492
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
King of Hell sent a sip of watermelon juice

493
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,280
into the lover's mouth.

494
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
And he drank

495
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,240
Red date longan tea.

496
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,880
They look at each other.

497
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
I really admire

498
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,280
such a good man.

499
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,520
Stop pushing

500
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
I can't get in.

501
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,700
There's no space left.

502
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Pay now.

503
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,620
Make a reservation in three days.

504
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,400
I have money.

505
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,240
Pay up.

506
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,200
Come on.

507
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,440
Here you are.

508
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,330
This is my money.

509
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,920
This is mine and mine.

510
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,680
Ziqi.

511
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,930
Why did you open the window too?

512
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Even you...

513
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
It's too popular.

514
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,660
By the way, read it.

515
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,680
But

516
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,700
is indeed extraordinary.

517
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,400
It's late.

518
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,360
What are you doing here?

519
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
My home is surrounded.

520
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,820
I can't go back.

521
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,240
The content of this book

522
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,440
is so real.

523
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,920
But it's really fake.

524
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,680
If I had

525
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,920
with women,

526
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,120
my child

527
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,850
is enough to form a team to farm.

528
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
That makes sense.

529
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,640
Then

530
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,200
What should we do? Let's go.

531
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,000
Investigate.

532
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,330
Investigate it now.

533
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,200
and clear my name.

534
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,280
and bring peace to Chang'an.

535
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,280
This month's salt compared to last month,

536
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,480
more than last month.

537
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,530
The price hasn’t risen.

538
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,000
27,000 bolts are missing

539
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,600
but the price dropped by 30%.

540
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,200
You have no idea.

541
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,280
The salt in Huainan region in Shaanxi is missing.

542
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,160
In three days,

543
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,200
in three days.

544
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,600
50,000 bolts of cloth

545
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
50,000 bolts of cloth.

546
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,520
The profit is more profitable

547
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,840
by 40%.

548
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Mr. Bang,

549
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
please forgive me this time.

550
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,200
I won't do it again.

551
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,400
The north of Huainan

552
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,730
It's far from Chang'an.

553
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,360
Why must you travel so far?

554
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,120
to buy your salt

555
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,610
to buy your salt.

556
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,770
The amount of cloth in Henan in Guannei

557
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,720
is twice as much as last year.

558
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,980
I had to buy cloth from you.

559
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,520
I was wrong.

560
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,520
You fed your own pockets seven times.

561
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,360
from salt, cloth, candles

562
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,960
and even extracted silver from gold and silver.

563
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,120
in total.

564
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,960
7,895 taels.

565
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
Fake accounts are full of flaws.

566
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,000
How did you manage the business?

567
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,840
Chairman.

568
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,620
Here you go. Thank you.

569
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,400
all your property.

570
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,160
is about 4,000 taels of gold.

571
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
The money I mentioned

572
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,120
is not a penny less.

573
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,440
to the Chamber of Commerce.

574
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,120
Please

575
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,810
please forgive him.

576
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,730
Thank you, Mr. Bang.

577
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,200
Sir.

578
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,840
Send the money

579
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,640
Send it to

580
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
to your hometown.

581
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,500
She's always mean.

582
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,440
When you send it to her,

583
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,570
say something nice.

584
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,620
I know what you want to say.

585
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,210
Don't worry.

586
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm not upset.

587
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,460
Since they took my bullet,

588
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,360
I can get

589
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,440
what I want.

590
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,280
His king of hell is domineering.

591
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
The love released

592
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,280
It's hot

593
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,120
and suffocating.

594
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,360
Every day when the King of Hell pushed the door,

595
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,920
he can feel

596
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,840
burning feelings.

597
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,160
It's like he's a treasure that everyone wants.

598
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,200
You must hold it in your hands

599
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,200
in your heart.

600
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,640
King of Hell holds her face

601
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,200
and say it gently.

602
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,720
In this world

603
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,360
in this world.

604
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,720
Write.

605
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,360
King of Hell blushes when he sees his lover.

606
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,200
and even unwilling to

607
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,680
That pair

608
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,060
looking at your lover passionately.

609
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,880
A few drops of water

610
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,840
Wait.

611
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,280
Isn't it burning eyes?

612
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,160
Why is it dripping again?

613
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
That makes sense.

614
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,360
Mr. Li is really amazing.

615
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,720
You can catch me every time.

616
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
Wrong language.

617
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,880
Come on.

618
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,220
Have some watermelon.

619
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,720
Thank you.

620
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,960
Thank you.

621
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,400
Then...

622
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,440
That burning eyes

623
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,280
almost

624
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,680
all over his body.

625
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,600
This fire

626
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,760
can burn the whole world.

627
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
What do you think?

628
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,280
How is it?

629
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,260
Wonderful.

630
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
You're talented.

631
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,120
Sure.

632
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,720
Wonderful

633
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,360
Wonderful

634
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,200
This...

635
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,640
This...

636
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,960
This...

637
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,680
What's going on?

638
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,200
You...

639
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
Why are you here?

640
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,760
Burn

641
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,960
all the books.

642
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,520
Yes.

643
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,140
This...

644
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,920
Don't!

645
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,960
Don't burn it!

646
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,440
Don't!

647
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,920
Don't burn it.

648
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,720
Don't.

649
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Hua Xiao Zheng.

650
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
and disrupt social morale.

651
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,680
Fabrication, slander,

652
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,360
and slander others.

653
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,580
All profits will be confiscated.

654
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,000
Xu Ziqi.

655
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,240
The world is vast.

656
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,000
than you.

657
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,120
Living is a waste of air.

658
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,380
It's a waste of land if you die.

659
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,960
You're so pedantic.

660
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,440
Without the image of a pig,

661
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,960
but he's capable.

662
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,200
But he can't hear

663
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,960
he can't hear me.

664
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,840
I'll go find him now.

665
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,440
and scold him face to face.

666
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Xu Xu.

667
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,000
Xu Ziqi.

668
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,760
You...

669
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,640
Xu Ziqi.

670
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,200
Hua Xiaochi.

671
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,500
What are you doing?

672
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,920
Xu Ziqi.

673
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
What do you want?

674
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,640
You want me to pay back your money?

675
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
You don't want me to make money.

676
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,280
Why don't you let me live?

677
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,120
Hua Xiao Zheng!

678
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,820
Hua Xiao Zheng!

679
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,050
You crazy woman.

680
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
I did beat you up.

681
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,440
Then what?

682
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Good job. Good job.

683
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,680
Nice punch.

684
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,740
I should beat you to death.

685
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
You bastard!

686
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,440
How dare you keep private goods?

687
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,440
Go ahead.

688
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,920
I just...

689
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,600
Burn what?

690
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:55,960
I...

691
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,000
Xu Ziqi.

692
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,440
I'm not sick.

693
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,880
It's you.

694
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,440
I've hit you today.

695
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,120
You made me lose money twice before.

696
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,680
We're even.

697
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
I came here

698
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
to do something big.

699
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,360
If you dare to stop me,

700
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,920
I'll beat you to death.

701
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,640
How dare you!

702
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,100
Stop fighting.

703
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Let's make a deal.

704
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,680
Condition?

705
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,440
Okay.

706
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,520
Okay.

707
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,690
I won't lower myself to your level.

708
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,040
It hurts so much.

709
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,970
It hurts so much.

710
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,060
Within seven days,

711
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,360
within seven days.

712
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,420
Hua Xiao Zheng will make enough money

713
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,140
to pay the debt for Xu Ziqi.

714
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,720
or I'll never come back

715
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,090
and never come back.

716
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,690
On the contrary,

717
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
if you pay off your debts,

718
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,960
Xu Ziqi runs naked in public.

719
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,840
OK.

720
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,240
Deal.

721
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,840
After you leave Chang'an,

722
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,760
after you leave Chang'an.

723
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,960
It's a good choice.

724
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,040
Wait and see.

725
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,020
What are you doing?

726
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,820
What are you doing?

727
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,730
I'm here.

728
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,120
Xu Ziqi.

729
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
Aren't you a delinquent?

730
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,970
Aren't you the King of Hell?

731
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,260
Forget about the toes.

732
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,160
Your fingers are like this too.

733
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,640
Can't you cherish your life?

734
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,960
Why did you cut it so deep?

735
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,090
Hurry up and sign it.

736
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,180
Come on.

737
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,090
Pinky swear.

738
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,610
Pinky swear.

739
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,480
A gentleman never goes back on his word.

740
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,320
I won't go back on my word.

741
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,960
Okay.

742
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Separate hatred.

743
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,920
What?

744
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,280
Help!

745
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,060
What are you doing?

746
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,680
Help!

747
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,640
Help!

748
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,360
Help!

749
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,240
Go ahead.

750
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,680
No one will come to save you

751
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,760
no one will come to save you.

752
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,960
You'll ruin

753
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,889
your innocence.

754
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,600
You...

755
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,800
You finally show yourself.

756
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,520
You're finally going to kill me.

757
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,280
Right?

758
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,840
I knew it.

759
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,889
you can't keep pretending.

760
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,840
You wrote

761
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,900
was written by you.

762
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,360
Did you write this book

763
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,260
to suppress your emotions

764
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,239
to suppress your emotions

765
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,159
to provoke me.

766
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,290
Now everything is exposed.

767
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,880
We're going to be a beast!

768
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,880
No!

769
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,620
What are you doing?

770
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Are you observing me?

771
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,900
Looking for inspiration?

772
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,120
You want me to be your male lead?

773
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,050
You want me to be your secret lover?

774
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,800
Cut the crap.

775
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,880
Tell me.

776
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,400
the quickest way

777
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,260
in a short time.

778
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,440
Work hard.

779
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,360
Be humble.

780
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,120
Thank you.

781
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,080
For the dream

782
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Keep fighting

783
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
Come on! Come on! Come on!

784
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,360
Xu Ziqi.

785
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,240
I'll kill you!

786
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,240
My lord.

787
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,840
Sir!

788
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,840
That monster ran out.

789
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,440
What for?

790
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,920
I think so.

791
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,960
with Lord Xu.

792
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,240
Within seven days,

793
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,400
in seven days

794
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,720
to pay Mr. Xu's debt.

795
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,240
Then we won't interfere with each other.

796
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,080
That's it.

797
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,240
In the novel,

798
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,640
in the novel.

799
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,760
It's true.

800
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,800
Sir.

801
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,560
Don't let that scourge succeed.

802
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,040
If you don't ruin Lord Xu,

803
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,440
if he doesn't.

804
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
That makes sense.

805
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,770
It's the same style as King of Hell.

806
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,440
So beautiful.

807
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,560
Red dates are good for blood.

808
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Goji berries replenish kidney.

809
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,160
Real man.

810
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,240
Red date longan goji berry tea

811
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,700
Take some goji berries

812
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,400
Drink more.

813
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,050
It's the same style as King of Hell.

814
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,720
Red dates to replenish blood.

815
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,520
Goji berries replenish kidney.

816
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,120
Real men drink

817
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,640
Red date, wolfberry and longan tea.

818
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,600
Come on.

819
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,320
King of Hell.

820
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,880
Hua Xiao Zheng.

821
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,320
My lord.

822
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,520
I've bought

823
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
I bought them all.

824
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,360
My lord.

825
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Did we buy too much?

826
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,380
I need to buy more samples.

827
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,960
By then,

828
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,640
we can defeat

829
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,440
in one go.

830
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,400
You are so smart.

831
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,960
Your Excellency is wise.

832
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Come on.

833
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,640
Exclusive drink for the Queen of Hell.

834
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,800
watermelon juice.

835
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,360
It's good to relieve thirst.

836
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,640
It's better than black tea and green tea.

837
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,520
One cup a day and you look rosy.

838
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,480
The water is tender.

839
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,600
A pot of skin like snow a day.

840
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,040
Soft.

841
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,740
The babies of King of Hell.

842
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,080
Whoever drinks will earn money.

843
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,360
Come on.

844
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,560
Give me one.

845
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,920
I want one too.

846
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,000
Everyone has one.

847
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,440
I'll put the money here.

848
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,040
Yama!

849
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,560
The living Yama.

850
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,200
Hua Xiao Zheng!

851
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,480
Arrest her!

852
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,240
Look!

853
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
There's a meteor.

854
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,720
What?

855
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,840
What?

856
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,000
What is it?

857
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,360
Hurry!

858
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,760
He ran away.

859
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,120
Yes!

860
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,330
Go after him!

861
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,240
I finally meet him in person.

862
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,520
So handsome!

863
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,960
Yama!

864
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,760
My Lord.

865
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,600
I bought

866
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,840
all the watermelon juice.

867
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,320
Sir.

868
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,380
You can't buy more.

869
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,040
Buy more.

870
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,760
Hua Xiaochi will be able to pay back

871
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,690
Lord Xu's money.

872
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,170
I don't want to spend the money.

873
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,840
But...

874
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,440
I won't go to hell. I won't go to hell.

875
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,500
Who will go to hell?

876
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,040
in case the people of Chang'an

877
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,280
by Hua Xiaochi.

878
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,920
I had to

879
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,360
suffer alone.

880
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,090
Your Excellency, you are so great.

881
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,040
How much does she owe Lord Xu?

882
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,800
I don't think so.

883
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,280
Okay.

884
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,440
My lord.

885
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,370
You drink first.

886
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:01,960
My lord.

887
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,820
Take your time.

888
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,320
watermelon seeds.

889
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,480
It's delicious and tasty.

890
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,240
It's so sweet.

891
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
Every time when King of Hell

892
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,760
fall asleep,

893
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,440
[she would gently]

894
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,960
watermelon seeds.

895
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,440
Look at the face of King of Hell.

896
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,320
At that time,

897
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,800
is still so handsome and handsome.

898
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,560
The same watermelon seeds as King of Hell.

899
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,840
Give me one.

900
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,640
I want one too.

901
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,960
I want this. I want two.

902
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,440
I paid for it.

903
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,600
Oh my god.

904
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,560
Xu Ziqi is so popular.

905
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,400
This girl is so dark.

906
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,560
I didn't expect her to be so popular.

907
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,000
No king.

908
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,860
Zigua, Xi King.

909
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,480
Li,

910
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,040
That scoundrel said

911
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,760
asked me to go to the tea house tomorrow

912
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,220
at the tea house tomorrow.

913
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,860
He said he had enough money

914
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,920
to break up with me in public.

915
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,440
Let's part ways

916
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
and be happy.

917
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,040
Great.

918
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,760
Why are you so happy?

919
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,720
I like that you want to escape from the claw

920
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
and feel happy.

921
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,880
But if Hua

922
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,240
breaks off with me,

923
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,440
your next target

924
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,320
is you.

925
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,880
I can only sacrifice myself

926
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
to protect you.

927
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
Or,

928
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,820
since I've been framed like this,

929
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,080
why don't

930
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,840
I'll suffer more.

931
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,880
Good brother.

932
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,490
we should share weal and woe together.

933
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,000
By the way,

934
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,000
I heard that

935
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,560
Husppy's hometown.

936
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,360
My cousin's puppy

937
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,890
It's been ten years.

938
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,920
and gave birth to a bunch of kids.

939
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,520
Yes.

940
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,480
That dog is indeed strong.

941
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,080
I didn't expect that.

942
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,760
Then...

943
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,080
Li.

944
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,080
Do you know?

945
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,320
I heard that

946
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,720
in the amusement park.

947
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,760
Next time,

948
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,380
let's go together.

949
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,120
I've asked Husppy

950
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,770
to prepare the tickets.

951
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,840
It's autumn.

952
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
I wonder

953
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,560
what the scoundrel is doing now.

954
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,880
Count money.

955
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,340
Thinking about how to make money.

956
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,960
I don't know

957
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
if she still

958
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,890
to count money tonight?

959
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,960
Xu Ziqi.

960
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,560
Wait and see.

961
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,400
Coming.

962
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,500
Hua Xiaochi

963
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,850
What do you mean?

964
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,520
Today, in front of everyone,

965
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,120
in front of everyone.

966
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,500
What about you?

967
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,240
I admit defeat.

968
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,240
He's here for you.

969
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,920
Cheers.

970
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,120
When you asked me out,

971
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,440
you only said you would pay me back.

972
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,240
Nothing else.

973
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,650
What do you mean?

974
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
You have to keep your promise.

975
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,450
Where did you get so many girls?

976
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Tomorrow,

977
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,240
then King of Hell will be here

978
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,080
to meet the ladies here.

979
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,240
and let you

980
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,880
to experience

981
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,120
what is

982
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,880
the man of hell?

983
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,320
The location is limited.

984
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,720
First come first served.

985
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,520
Only 30 copper cash

986
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,920
One for tea.

987
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,280
I want it.

988
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:02,960
Stop.

989
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,520
Besides the meeting,

990
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,180
there's a handshake meeting.

991
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,080
As long as everyone is enthusiastic,

992
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,160
the king of hell can bring us home.

993
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,720
Let me hear your enthusiasm.

994
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,800
You're not getting away!

995
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,960
Take me with you.

996
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,560
Run together. Run together.

997
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,560
Put me down!

998
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Put me down!

999
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,280
He's really a good man.

1000
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,400
