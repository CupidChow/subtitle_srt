1
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,720
Xu Ziqi, put me down.

2
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,800
I remember you said you want 100 taels of gold.

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,810
What? You don't want the money?

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
Why? Aren't you going to count?

5
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,079
I knew you wouldn't give up.

6
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Lord Xu.

7
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,680
You must keep your word.

8
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,300
You can't change the bet when you receive money.

9
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,800
How could I

10
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,520
agree to sign this nude gamble?

11
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,400
If this gets out,

12
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,079
our reputation will be ruined.

13
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,640
What are you thinking about?

14
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,460
Are you trying to deny it? In your dreams.

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
What time is it now?

16
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,560
It seems to be 3 o'clock

17
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,800
I have something important to do at midnight today.

18
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm leaving.

19
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,730
Don't think about breaking the contract.

20
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,780
Why are you acting like a plaster?

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,520
I won’t break my promise.

22
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,140
I’ll fulfill it in seven days.

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,860
It can be like this.

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,840
I didn't write it right away.

25
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,079
Seven days later,

26
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,960
in seven days.

27
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
I won't break my promise.

28
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
If you break your promise,

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
I'll curse you to never retire.

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,020
and never get married.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Thank you. Thank you.

32
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
I won't break my promise.

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,560
Xu Ziqi, seven days is fine.

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,320
If you dare to do anything,

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,040
I will make you regret.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,130
Tu Jia Ding, lead a team.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,170
Run 20 laps each.

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,079
Go! Go! Go! Go!

39
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,560
Yes.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,040
Hurry up!

41
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,360
We've finally escaped.

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,040
But seven days later,

43
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,400
she has the bet.

44
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
If I had known,

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,080
I should have hit her last night

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,140
hit her to lose her memory last night.

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
No way.

48
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,330
If you get stunned by the knocking,

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
I have to take care of him.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,800
What should I do?

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Where is he?

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
My clothes are wet.

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
It's so hot.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,860
Gather around.

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,220
It's time for the evening.

56
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,760
It's time to strengthen your body.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,320
I've decided to invest in a week

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,800
in a week.

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
The winner

60
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,540
20 taels of silver as a reward.

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,560
Here you go.

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,120
Bravo!

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
Hua Xiaochi

64
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,000
It's your fault for having too many bugs on the bet.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,130
I don't know if you're leaving alone or a group of people.

66
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
However,

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,880
there's a condition for the Spring Tournament.

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,640
That is

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
without wearing clothes all the time.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
Let the people in Chang'an

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,680
to see how healthy you are.

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,780
This...

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,700
This...

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,560
This...

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,000
No clothes?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
Yes no

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
Your body, hair, and your parents.

78
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,320
In broad daylight,

79
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,380
in broad daylight.

80
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,640
This is inappropriate.

81
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,560
Yes.

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
But 20 taels of silver.

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,960
It's not about money.

84
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,800
I can't afford to lose face.

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,120
Yeah.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,930
What's wrong

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,330
Is it embarrassing not to wear a shirt?

88
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,080
Embarrassing

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Give me that.

90
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,820
This...

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
Are you embarrassed?

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Not at all.

93
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,520
You're not embarrassed, are you?

94
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,180
Let's do it.

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,000
We're in!

96
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
We're in! We're in!

97
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,640
Here.

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Kid.

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,040
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

100
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,880
King of Hell is awake.

101
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,120
King of Hell is awake.

102
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,880
Xu Ziqi.

103
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't take off my clothes.

104
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
Stop it.

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,700
Isn't it a week patrol?

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,760
This is my house.

107
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,880
The bet didn't say where the starting point of running naked is.

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,960
I said it's here.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,530
You're acting like a rogue.

110
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,370
I shouldn't.

111
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
I'm a rascal?

112
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,000
Why didn't you mention your tournament?

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,640
You pervert!

114
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Hua Xiaotong, where are you going?

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,620
What are you doing?

116
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,320
If I show my real face,

117
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,090
I won't be King of Hell anymore.

118
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,760
You lost.

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
you have to run naked.

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
Hua Xiao Zheng, don't go too far.

121
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
What do you think?

122
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,880
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

123
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,360
OK.

124
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
Listen to me first.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,559
I'll help you.

126
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,559
Please help me.

127
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,799
Just do me a favor.

128
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,159
I'll play a set of Xu family boxing.

129
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,159
a complete set.

130
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,299
It's not vague.

131
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,480
No clothes all the time.

132
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
Whoever wears it will be the grandson.

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,320
Bah!

134
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,680
I don't want to be your grandson.

135
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
You can do boxing,

136
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
But you still have to take it off.

137
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I'll do it myself.

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,800
Why isn't he here yet?

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,560
Go find it.

140
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,560
Thank you

141
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
for attending

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
King of Hell today.

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
Applause!

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Next,

145
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
King of Hell will show you

146
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
his glorious face

147
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,320
and

148
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
Xu fist.

149
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
Now let's welcome

150
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Let's welcome

151
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
Xu Ziqi.

152
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,480
Hello, King of Hell.

153
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
Cool!

154
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,680
King of Hell is so adorable.

155
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,200
What is this?

156
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
I invited a band for you.

157
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Let's have a boxing match.

158
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Make it powerful.

159
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,740
Let's go. Let's go.

160
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
So handsome.

161
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,080
It turns out that King of Hell

162
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
is a scholar.

163
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,680
King of Hell. No.

164
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,960
It's Xu Junlang.

165
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,440
He's really handsome.

166
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
Very handsome

167
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,540
Let's go. Okay.

168
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,560
Let's go. Let's go.

169
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,480
Okay.

170
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Let's applaud

171
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,840
for Xu Ziqi.

172
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Okay.

173
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
What's wrong with me?

174
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,050
Why is my heart beating so fast?

175
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,400
Love is

176
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,720
When you see this person,

177
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,280
your heart will flutter.

178
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,680
My Lord.

179
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,680
The Oiran election will be held in ten days.

180
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,840
The new assets of Lord Jia and Lord Wang

181
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,080
has entered an illegal private bank.

182
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,280
You can’t leave until you sign it.

183
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,720
This is the list of new items.

184
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,440
Okay.

185
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,160
Get ready.

186
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,170
Yes, my lord.

187
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Hua Xiao Zheng,

188
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,960
with Lord Xu.

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,280
What's wrong?

190
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,800
My lord.

191
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
You're amazing.

192
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,800
Not only did she pay Mr. Xu,

193
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,040
and forced Lord Xu to reveal his true identity.

194
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,960
The audience is very lively.

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,960
King of Hell showed himself.

196
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,320
Then they

197
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,920
We're even now.

198
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,440
We're done for today. We're done for today.

199
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,210
Let's have dinner tonight.

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,200
My dear.

201
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
What do you want to do with me?

202
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,080
I want to

203
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,200
with you.

204
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,570
I want to fight with you too.

205
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Then...

206
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,960
Let's fight.

207
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,050
Let's fight.

208
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,080
Am I crazy?

209
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,200
Wait.

210
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,960
I just want to ask you about the blind date.

211
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,260
Why do you have more than 1,000 invitations to propose?

212
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
You...

213
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,080
It's because of the book. It's because of the book.

214
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
have captured so many girls

215
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,960
because of that novel.

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,680
If you show your true colors,

217
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,320
all the girls in Chang'an know you.

218
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,560
You were

219
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,400
who has better skin than snow.

220
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,440
Everyone has a heart for beauty.

221
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
Not to mention you.

222
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,560
are noble.

223
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,560
He comes from a distinguished family.

224
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,200
There are so many posts.

225
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,680
My lord,

226
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
This scourge has been here for more than half a month.

227
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,770
He doesn't want to leave at all.

228
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,320
Why don't Husppy find a way for you?

229
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Apart from this disaster,

230
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,090
the house will be peaceful.

231
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,160
If she leaves,

232
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
the house won't be peaceful.

233
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,480
People will talk about it.

234
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm a household.

235
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,880
I won't let a weak woman stay.

236
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,080
It will disgrace our family.

237
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,680
Don't act rashly now.

238
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,880
Your Excellency is right. Husppy is reckless.

239
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,480
My lord.

240
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,680
Do you want to have dinner with Lord Xu?

241
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,080
What's going on with Brother Xu?

242
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,200
There are hundreds of women

243
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,480
Hundreds of women are waiting

244
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
outside Fulai Restaurant.

245
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
Lord Xu.

246
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,080
It's a huge number. It's a blind date. Let's go. Let's go.

247
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Blind date?

248
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Looks like Brother Xu will find a good match this time.

249
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,600
She's gone mad again.

250
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Business opportunity!

251
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,770
Oh no, something is going to happen again.

252
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
She's just a weak girl.

253
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,170
Just find someone to keep an eye on her.

254
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,280
Are you looking for someone to keep an eye on her?

255
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,440
Tell me if anything happens.

256
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,400
Let me handle it myself.

257
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,720
Yes.

258
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,080
Miss Rao Sijin

259
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,440
Sixteen years old, her father is a vendor in the east of the city.

260
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,100
There are three shops at home.

261
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,320
They run small businesses.

262
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,680
I think

263
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,960
your attitude towards marriage is problematic.

264
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
Think about it.

265
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,720
We've never met.

266
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,280
No.

267
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,839
We've never lived together.

268
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,440
How can we grow old together?

269
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,760
What if your personality is not suitable?

270
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
You can't live a day, can you?

271
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
I don't think you can

272
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,760
No.

273
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,920
Do you like literature writing?

274
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,450
A woman's virtue is lack of talent.

275
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,200
What's the use of writing literature?

276
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,040
The youngest daughter of the Han family, Chan Juan.

277
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,240
She's the daughter of Han Dachang, the daughter of Han Dachang, a rich man of mulberry silkworm.

278
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,040
Miss,

279
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,640
Do you like making money?

280
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,840
Making money?

281
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,240
Women should serve their husbands.

282
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
and take care of her husband.

283
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
and show up in public.

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,200
too frivolous.

285
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Luo Xi Wei, the eldest daughter of the Luo family

286
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,480
Her father owns a pawn shop in the east market on the 15th.

287
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,500
I've heard a lot about you.

288
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,640
Miss,

289
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,210
Do you like to quarrel with others?

290
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Fighting?

291
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,640
Mr. Xu, you...

292
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,000
You don't play by the book at all.

293
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,960
You go first.

294
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,410
Let's go.

295
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,640
Boss.

296
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,040
You asked me to spy on Lord Wu.

297
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,000
Lord Wu lives in Noble Lady Street.

298
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,440
He has been patrolling frequently recently.

299
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,570
The people are rare.

300
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,160
I've been away for three days.

301
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
I didn't even see Lord Wu.

302
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,810
Let's go.

303
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,500
Wait, wait.

304
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
This is your marriage.

305
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
You can't delay it.

306
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,440
None of the girls here is suitable.

307
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
King of Hell is really a king of hell.

308
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,480
He doesn't like girls in the mortal world.

309
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,640
Do you really want to find a female demon?

310
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,040
I...

311
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,300
I want to fight and read dialogue novels.

312
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
Where can I find him?

313
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,040
You must be tired from your blind date.

314
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,200
It's so sunny.

315
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,920
Should I buy an umbrella

316
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,600
to cover the sun?

317
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,640
I think so many girls

318
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
can definitely find the woman who smells like you. No.

319
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,960
who has the same taste with you.

320
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,720
It suits you.

321
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
It matches your clothes very well.

322
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Look at this one.

323
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Hua Xiaotong.

324
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,920
Here.

325
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Hua Xiaotong.

326
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,280
Xu...

327
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,640
Seo Seo.

328
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,520
My lord?

329
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,690
Hua Xiaochi.

330
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,680
Am I your tool to make money?

331
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,520
It's just a little money.

332
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
How can you call it money?

333
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,760
It's just pocket money.

334
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
pocket money.

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,440
Besides, I've told you

336
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,360
I have to make a fortune.

337
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,400
After observation,

338
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,000
you do have a good business ability.

339
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,720
So?

340
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,640
I've decided to give you a place for business.

341
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,680
You would be so good.

342
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,140
Don't worry about that. Let's go.

343
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,520
Noble Lady Street.

344
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,280
Look, the road is wide and smooth.

345
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,920
This building is magnificent and magnificent.

346
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,680
Look how magnificent the Wu Mansion is, right?

347
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,170
Look at this street.

348
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,760
how big this street is,

349
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,680
can be used for you.

350
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,200
Xu Ziqi.

351
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,760
Are you kidding me?

352
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,960
This street is full of royal families.

353
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Lord Xu,

354
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,400
What do you think is the most important thing in business?

355
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,440
Money.

356
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,680
It's a man! A man!

357
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,200
Look how loud I yelled.

358
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
Is anyone there? Only a bird flew.

359
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
No, not even a bird.

360
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,440
How can we do business without a human?

361
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,500
I want to be lonely.

362
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,160
Make up stories

363
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,360
to show your talent.

364
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
You don't have to thank me.

365
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,400
for giving you such a good opportunity.

366
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,440
We delinquents

367
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,600
will patrol here every morning and night.

368
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,120
By then,

369
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,050
remember to report your business situation to them.

370
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,300
Don't thank me.

371
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,760
Come on.

372
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,880
He's obviously making fun of me.

373
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,040
He hates me for exposing his identity.

374
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,300
for personal revenge.

375
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,200
Xu Ziqi.

376
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,880
You want to see me make a fool of myself?

377
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,680
No way.

378
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Just wait and see.

379
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,680
See how I turn Gan Kun around.

380
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,000
There's nothing here.

381
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,840
Let's see.

382
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
There's a magical book

383
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,810
It's a book that the readers love to let go.

384
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
The readers always praise it.

385
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,650
The delicate story.

386
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,200
The twists and turns of emotions.

387
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,920
That's a compliment.

388
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,680
The name of this book is

389
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,040
the secret lover of King of Hell.

390
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,160
Now,

391
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,360
this author

392
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,760
has published a new version of sisters.

393
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,240
This new book

394
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,680
is called "The Young Master of the House falls in love with me."

395
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,440
Do you want to hear more?

396
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,400
Yes.

397
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,960
Who is it?

398
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,200
Who?

399
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,600
Coming.

400
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,200
Li.

401
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,820
What happened?

402
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,520
Come in.

403
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,480
Sit down.

404
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,380
What's wrong with you?

405
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:03,960
Sit.

406
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,760
What now?

407
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,260
You still have the mood to take a bath?

408
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,440
I almost died in the Chamber of Commerce today.

409
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
Didn't you say you've dealt with

410
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
with Hua Xiaotong?

411
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,640
It's only been a few days.

412
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,890
You're getting excited again.

413
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,180
There you go again.

414
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,280
I came to the Chamber of Commerce today

415
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,480
to ask you

416
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,720
if he can manage his woman.

417
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,200
The adults in Noble Lady Street

418
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,760
can't live like this.

419
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,720
If you're in a relationship,

420
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,850
Do we have to be known all over the city?

421
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,240
Look at this.

422
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,920
The son of the house fell in love with me.

423
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,200
What are these?

424
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,880
It's nonsense.

425
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,360
When I went back,

426
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,200
seven or eight concubines were surrounded.

427
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,240
kisses, hug and lift them up.

428
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,480
Raise seven or eight times a day.

429
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,600
Young adults are fine

430
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,120
The adults who passed the age

431
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,460
For example, Lord Liu.

432
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Raise seven or eight of them every day.

433
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,960
My arm is tired and dislocated.

434
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
As the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

435
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,690
how can I make a living in the world?

436
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,850
I'm still... I'm...

437
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,880
Alright.

438
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,850
Noble Lady Street's recruitment.

439
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,360
Lord Xu, look at the drum.

440
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,360
It's made at home.

441
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
It's very solid and durable.

442
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Pancakes.

443
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,880
Lord Xu.

444
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
Take a look. How about some pancakes?

445
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,440
Two

446
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,330
It tastes good. It smells good.

447
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,960
Okay.

448
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,520
Okay.

449
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,960
Man Tou.

450
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,600
Lord Xu.

451
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
It's freshly cooked.

452
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
Tu Da.

453
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,960
Tu Da, why are you running a stall here?

454
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Work.

455
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,840
No.

456
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,920
We haven't seen each other for three days.

457
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,450
How did it become like this?

458
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,940
Let's go have a look

459
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,040
Come on

460
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,400
Don't miss it.

461
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,640
Golden location of Noble Lady Street.

462
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,100
High-end purchase force.

463
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,960
We've started recruiting.

464
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,960
Welcome to the food stall.

465
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,760
Make a street for snacks.

466
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,200
Sure.

467
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,400
You think you just gave me

468
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,160
a stall that can do business?

469
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,400
No, you gave it to me.

470
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,600
It's a whole street that can be recruited.

471
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,480
Boss.

472
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,440
Do you know

473
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,440
the news of a stall in Noble Lady Street?

474
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,240
Once we go out,

475
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,600
these shops barged in

476
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,800
to grab the position.

477
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
There are many people here.

478
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,760
it's easier for me to monitor them.

479
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,720
If I set up a stall like this,

480
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,580
We can earn at least 20 copper cash

481
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,000
Boss.

482
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,400
That's a brilliant idea.

483
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,580
This is the love between Hua Feifei and Mr. Fang.

484
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,960
Take a look.

485
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
how Hua Feifei chased Mr. Fang inside.

486
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
Isn't it wonderful?

487
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
Hua Xiaochi

488
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,680
Bravo!

489
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,970
I'm so excited that I can't even speak.

490
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,200
Come here.

491
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,000
Sit down.

492
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,600
You...

493
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,940
Are you here to collect protection fees?

494
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,330
This is ten taels of silver I earned in three days.

495
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,490
I’ll leave it to you.

496
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,480
Ten taels.

497
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,280
Silver.

498
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,040
This money was earned by a dirty business.

499
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,100
It's unjust money.

500
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,660
I won't argue with you.

501
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,920
But you've ruined Chang'an's reputation.

502
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,980
You must withdraw.

503
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,760
I knew

504
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,640
you would use this excuse to pick me up.

505
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,160
The son of the house fell in love with me

506
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,480
is pure love.

507
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,640
It says Hua Feifei and Mr. Bang.

508
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,960
sweet love.

509
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,520
It's about watching the stars together

510
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,780
and the moon together.

511
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,680
From life philosophy to poetry

512
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,200
How is it dirty?

513
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,240
Look.

514
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
You are not with Li.

515
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,600
You're ruining his reputation.

516
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,000
It's only a matter of time

517
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
will happen sooner or later.

518
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,960
This is a love guidebook.

519
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
Maybe Mr. Bang already bought it.

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
He's studying in his room.

521
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
Ridiculous.

522
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Look at your temper.

523
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,960
Did you

524
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,200
the blind date failed again?

525
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,400
Then...

526
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,840
She's not a suitable girl for me.

527
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,520
I owe you a wife.

528
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,000
This book

529
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
as a gift to you.

530
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,880
Study hard.

531
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,280
Study hard.

532
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,720
and carefully.

533
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
You'll find the girl you like.

534
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,480
Don't say I won't share with you.

535
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,920
Do you know the richest Mr. Wu on this street?

536
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,480
That one.

537
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,960
Walking peacocks

538
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,840
to walk peacocks.

539
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
His Majesty's brother.

540
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,720
Lord Wu.

541
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,840
You know?

542
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,200
How did she know about Lord Wu?

543
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Lord Wu has a mistress.

544
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,400
That...

545
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,880
That one.

546
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,280
in the Commerce’s Food and Housing Elders.

547
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,360
Master Yi?

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,160
I heard he has been in contact with Elder in Clothes.

549
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,400
and was caught by his third wife.

550
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,160
Guess what happened next?

551
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,020
What happened?

552
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,200
His third wife read what I wrote

553
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
and learned the secret of love.

554
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
Lord Wu is so happy every day.

555
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,280
every day.

556
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,880
for three days.

557
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,440
How did you know

558
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,240
these secrets?

559
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,570
I was just chatting with sunflower seeds.

560
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,200
Every girl

561
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,680
who broke her heart.

562
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,640
Am I right?

563
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
It's only three days.

564
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,440
and you already know so many things.

565
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,010
So you like to listen to these stories.

566
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,930
You know Lord Liu of Minister of Rites, right?

567
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,640
He was practicing his arms in the yard a few days ago.

568
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,760
Swing the ball. Swing. Swing.

569
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,040
He shakes off his arm.

570
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,700
Isn't it funny?

571
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,680
So,

572
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,160
study hard.

573
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,440
Love is a study.

574
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,240
Don't expect God to lose your wife.

575
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,690
How dare you!

576
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,490
I was rude and reckless.

577
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,650
I didn't realize

578
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,240
you were a girl.

579
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,520
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,640
You saved her.

581
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,940
she slapped you twice.

582
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,480
It's so floating.

583
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Throw her back and keep floating

584
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,680
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,360
Excuse me.

586
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,440
Thank you for saving my life.

587
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,600
Don't worry about it.

588
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,840
This is really

589
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,040
You're giving a wife to Xu Ziqi.

590
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,120
Which family are you from?

591
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,600
I'm the only daughter of Yang Lin, the butler of the house.

592
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,000
The only daughter of the Imperial Guard of Tang, Yang Debiao.

593
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,000
Chief Yang's daughter?

594
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
You know me?

595
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,960
That girl is...

596
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,400
I'm Hua Xiaochi.

597
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,440
It's you.

598
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,480
My father often mentioned Miss Hua.

599
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,760
It must be a bad thing.

600
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,280
Although my father

601
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,000
for Miss Xiaomei,

602
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,120
But I've read two dialogue novels.

603
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,280
I think Miss Hua is elegant

604
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,800
She's very generous.

605
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,900
Thank you for the compliment.

606
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,240
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Xu.

607
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,440
I heard that Mr. Xu has been loyal for three generations.

608
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,840
and a loyal family.

609
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,050
I really admire you.

610
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,920
Loyalty for the country.

611
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,120
to serve the country.

612
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,440
I wonder who else is in your house.

613
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,199
You are a handsome man.

614
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,600
and noble.

615
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,489
Deibiao is not married yet.

616
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,880
Knowing that you are alone,

617
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,480
why don't we get married?

618
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,639
and get married someday.

619
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,639
What do you think?

620
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
You saved Debiao in danger.

621
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,360
I fell in love with you at first sight.

622
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,880
I admire your grace.

623
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,360
I admire your ancestors.

624
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,840
I would like to marry you.

625
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,080
I'll ask my father to prepare the betrothal gifts

626
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,239
to propose.

627
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,440
Sure.

628
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,810
What are you talking about?

629
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,080
I think it's dawn now.

630
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,320
I have something urgent to do.

631
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,280
Well...

632
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,320
Take care, Miss Yang. Take care, Miss Yang.

633
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,810
Your Excellency

634
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,120
Xu Ziqi.

635
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
Why do you always make excuses at midnight?

636
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,580
Can you change something new?

637
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,840
Maybe I have bad luck every day at 3 a.m.

638
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,120
Why are you here again today?

639
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,880
Are you embarrassed to ask for protection money?

640
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,290
Who wants your protection fee?

641
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,280
Yang De Biao refused to leave outside my office.

642
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,210
He said he would wait for my answer.

643
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Yes.

644
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,040
Except her name,

645
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,920
She's very good.

646
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,820
I don't want to talk to you.

647
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Just take a look and you'll know.

648
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Is it that good?

649
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,160
Look.

650
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,960
It's very beautiful. It's really amazing.

651
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,440
Let me tell you.

652
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,320
you must remember

653
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,600
if you meet a girl,

654
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,080
your heart pounds.

655
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,880
That's love.

656
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,960
So when you see Miss Yang,

657
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,100
do you have a heart?

658
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,240
Thump, thump, thump.

659
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,440
I'm asking you.

660
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
Is it too hot

661
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,040
your ears are ringing?

662
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,080
Look, your ears are red.

663
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,890
It must be because you drank too much red date tea.

664
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,540
What are you doing?

665
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,650
Pull your pulse.

666
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,920
The pulse is at the wrist below the hand.

667
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,720
Why are you touching my hand?

668
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,120
Why does your heart beat so fast

669
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,320
your heart beats so fast?

670
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,090
Where are you going?

671
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,560
Protect the people of Tang!

672
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Protect Tang!

673
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,720
Good luck.

674
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,480
Something's up.

675
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,920
Miss Yang.

676
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Miss Xiao.

677
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Why are you here?

678
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,560
Miss Yang, wait.

679
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,400
Miss Yang, I have something important to discuss with you.

680
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,160
Lord Xu saved your life that day.

681
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,400
Shouldn't you thank him in person?

682
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,760
Yes.

683
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,960
If I thank you in person,

684
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,360
Is it inconvenient to have more people?

685
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,960
It's better to meet alone.

686
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,920
That's true.

687
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,440
If we meet alone,

688
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,760
shouldn't we dress up

689
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,320
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

690
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,520
If so,

691
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,560
That's great.

692
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,760
Miss Yang, what a coincidence.

693
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,960
Lord Xu

694
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
in the room on the second floor of Fulai Restaurant.

695
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,080
You must have time, right?

696
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,600
Thank you.

697
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,640
You're welcome.

698
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,920
Xu Ziqi.

699
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,600
You need to show your charm.

700
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,280
Look at this marked face.

701
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,240
And a good hairstyle.

702
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,920
Perfect.

703
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,880
Do you have to go this far?

704
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
This is a great opportunity.

705
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
How many times can we fight in life?

706
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,480
If you can get Yang Debiao this time,

707
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,360
you'll be a perfect son-in-law.

708
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,960
Yang Lin is the butler of the house.

709
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,240
Mr. Fang is so rich.

710
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
You'll have nothing to worry about.

711
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,960
and get closer to Mr. Fang.

712
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,480
Hua Xiaochi.

713
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,330
Do you really want me to marry Yang Debiao?

714
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,960
It's all about glory and wealth.

715
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,960
And your pants.

716
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,500
You have to change.

717
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,320
Sir.

718
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,080
You came too early.

719
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,400
You arrived two hours earlier.

720
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,320
It's too grand.

721
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
That makes sense.

722
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,520
Then what should I do?

723
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,720
First of all,

724
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,120
Sir.

725
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,440
Sir.

726
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,820
Lord Xu is here.

727
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,840
Where are you going, sir?

728
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,960
I know.

729
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,960
You must think

730
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,520
too grand.

731
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,480
Pretend to be late

732
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,960
Let's go.

733
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,160
Sir.

734
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,480
Lord Xu didn't wake up early this morning

735
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,280
The chicken woke up to dress up.

736
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,040
The preparation is so exquisite.

737
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,080
Exactly.

738
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,480
My husband too.

739
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,920
The chicken hasn't barked yet.

740
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,960
before the chicken barks.

741
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,120
That's what you think.

742
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,360
Try your best.

743
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Let's go. Let's go.

744
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,320
Let's go.

745
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,920
Come back.

746
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,280
Sit down.

747
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,960
Okay.

748
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,320
Miss Yang, let's continue.

749
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,050
Why are you sitting down again?

750
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,480
My lord.

751
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,000
Look at this scoundrel.

752
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,490
Why are you so clueless?

753
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,120
I'm here to work.

754
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
I'm not interested in

755
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,490
I'm not interested.

756
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,440
By the way,

757
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,040
what do you usually do?

758
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,320
Take me for example.

759
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,000
I like eating and walking around.

760
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,160
I like to put on makeup and sleep in.

761
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,920
You eat and drink well.

762
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,240
You are diligent and wasteful.

763
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,000
I just want to study hard and serve the country.

764
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,960
Well said.

765
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,080
Lord Xu also wakes up

766
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,880
every morning

767
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,140
and serve the country.

768
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,960
I fight to strengthen my body.

769
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,040
My ancestors died for the country.

770
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,400
I just want to live.

771
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,810
The way to serve the country is different.

772
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,160
Living well is also for the country.

773
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,960
Lord Xu likes to study too.

774
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,920
Really?

775
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
What book does Lord Xu usually read?

776
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,760
Mr. Fang fell in love with me.

777
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,040
My lord, I'd better send you back.

778
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,800
I just want to work somewhere else.

779
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,160
Isn't it

780
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,600
Isn't it good?

781
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,970
It's lively.

782
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,800
Shouldn't you be quiet when dealing with work?

783
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,480
I mean

784
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,400
Sparks in the mortal world. Yes.

785
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,480
Sparks in the mortal world

786
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,160
is most touching.

787
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,440
That's right.

788
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,000
Okay.

789
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,100
This is the bud from Fangshan.

790
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,960
Lord Xu is so elegant.

791
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,240
Miss Yang, you're amazing.

792
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
Smell it and you'll know what it is.

793
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,480
I knew it.

794
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,320
It's not that a family doesn't come in, right?

795
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,100
The son of the country taught Debiao tea skills.

796
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,880
He is quite good at tea.

797
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,560
I'm flattered, Miss Yang.

798
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,520
I ordered the tea casually.

799
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,080
It's economical.

800
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,360
It's not expensive.

801
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm here to thank you today.

802
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,770
Thank you for saving my life a few days ago.

803
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,240
Please accept my bow.

804
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,640
I shall take my leave.

805
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,080
Xu Ziqi.

806
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,400
There's still time. Miss Yang.

807
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
Lord Xu and Chairman Bang are close.

808
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,960
There are still many chances to meet him.

809
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,720
Don't worry.

810
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,240
I'm here to thank you.

811
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,840
It doesn't matter. We have plenty of time.

812
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,400
Yes.

813
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,770
There's a long way to go.

814
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,440
Xu Ziqi.

815
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,240
Xu...

816
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,240
Xu Ziqi.

817
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,500
What's wrong with you?

818
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,720
What's wrong with me?

819
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,140
Did I ask you to marry Miss Yang for me?

820
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,560
No.

821
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,480
But I'm doing this for your sake.

822
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,520
For my sake?

823
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,960
Do you think for me or for yourself?

824
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,160
or for yourself.

825
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
I don't want to mess around with you.

826
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,840
Also,

827
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,120
all the stalls in Noble Lady Street

828
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,850
will be canceled from today on.

829
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,280
Why?

830
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,840
disrupt Chang'an's atmosphere?

831
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,520
and disrupt the livelihood of Chang'an.

832
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,000
Not only that,

833
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,080
All income will be confiscated.

834
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,610
and the national treasury.

835
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,560
Do you have any justice?

836
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,360
You know

837
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,760
whether this matter is right or wrong.

838
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,440
Although it's not excessive in the book,

839
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,520
in the book,

840
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,120
But you can't sell

841
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,440
can't be sold by you.

842
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,360
I don't want to talk to you.

843
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,920
You...

844
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,440
Xu Ziqi.

845
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,800
You're always busy arranging marriage for others.

846
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,020
But what about your own marriage?

847
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,880
What brings you here, ancestor?

848
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,960
How can you not worry about your marriage?

849
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,160
You start your career and get married.

850
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,240
Marriage is important.

851
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Otherwise, the whole body will be affected

852
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,960
there will be many victims.

853
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,690
I've been busy making money recently.

854
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,440
I forgot about it.

855
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,520
Remember,

856
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,240
Your future husband is not an ordinary man.

857
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,370
He must ask for it from high places.

858
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,400
Is he tall

859
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,560
or Gao?

860
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,280
Remember 16 words.

861
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,280
Lofty and powerful.

862
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,880
and has a great backing.

863
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,320
He is upright

864
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,960
Handsome.

865
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,880
Handsome.

866
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,320
[There are times in our destiny.]

867
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,400
Waiting for the full moon to bloom.

868
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
This...

869
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,440
He doesn't ask for it from outside.

870
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,760
It's already in my destiny.

871
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,440
You mean

872
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,400
he has appeared?

873
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
My ancestors.

874
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,930
He's a high-ranking and powerful man.

875
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,560
He has a great waist.

876
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,800
and upright.

877
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,000
My lord.

878
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,160
Why hasn't she left yet?

879
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,760
Take a detour from the back door.

880
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,000
Don't let her find out

881
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,360
we were here.

882
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,800
Yes.

883
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,960
Separate hatred.
