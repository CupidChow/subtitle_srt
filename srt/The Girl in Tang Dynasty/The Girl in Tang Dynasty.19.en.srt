1
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,080
Xiaofei.

2
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,880
You're someone else's husband now.

3
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,740
Don't touch me.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,060
Whose husband am I?

5
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,610
I know everything about you

6
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,960
and Yang Debiao.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,180
She's right there.

8
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,900
Doesn't your conscience bother you?

9
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,760
Xiaofei,

10
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
you've misunderstood.

11
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,420
Stop following me,

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,680
or I'll hit you.

13
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,010
You've misunderstood.

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
I'll really hit you.

15
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,240
You...

16
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,400
I just came to mediate,

17
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,079
how did I end up getting hurt?

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,800
As a woman, one should be more gentle.

20
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,800
Why did you send Xu Ziqi away?

21
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,890
He's much more professional than I am.

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,120
And...

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
Aren't you two getting married?

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
What?

25
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,480
Didn't your father prepare the betrothal gifts for you?

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,400
You just need to confirm the engagement.

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
Brother Xu has always liked you.

28
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,079
He clearly rejected me.

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,320
What?

30
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,800
He originally thought

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,480
that you accepted Chairman Fang's shop and support

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,610
meaning you had chosen Chairman Fang.

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,800
He was very upset

34
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,560
and completely disheartened.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,520
But everything that happened today

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,780
made him understand your true feelings.

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,680
So he misunderstood you.

38
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,079
I never intended to accept Fang Lihen.

39
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,520
What was Xu Ziqi thinking?

40
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,079
You need to

41
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,540
explain these things to Master Xu in person.

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,800
I can see

43
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,320
that you really like him.

44
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,690
He's right outside.

45
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Go explain everything to him.

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
My foot

47
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,840
is fine anyway.

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,640
Are you sure?

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,800
I smashed your foot so badly.

50
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,839
If the doctor hadn't said it would heal,

51
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,880
I wouldn't let you off so easily.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,640
Thank you.

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,680
So go find him quickly.

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
Actually, I don't really want to see you either.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,320
After all, for the next three months,

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,680
I can't put weight on my foot,

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,740
can't ride horses,

58
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,159
and can't walk by myself.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,320
Go quickly.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,440
Miss Yang, are you sure you're just going to

62
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,860
give up on Master Xu like this?

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,320
Yes.

64
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,980
I've read thousands of books.

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
In ancient texts,

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
I've read many tragic and touching stories,

67
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,170
or tales of fulfilled love.

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,620
But those ancient texts never tell us

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,680
how to find love or let it go.

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,970
If I can become the greatest female scholar of the Tang Dynasty,

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,680
I will surely write answers to these questions.

72
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
Miss Yang.

73
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,360
You are a wonderful girl.

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,560
I've always liked you,

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
and admired you too.

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,680
You will definitely meet

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,080
a boy who truly understands and loves you.

78
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
I know.

79
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
And thank you.

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
Where is Xu Ziqi?

81
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
So annoying.

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Work troubles,

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,680
relationship problems,

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
almost went to jail for hitting someone.

85
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,690
Looks like I need a drink

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,000
to ease my depressed mood.

87
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,960
Xu Ziqi, I summoned you here today

88
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,720
to bring you into the next phase of our plan.

89
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
After challenging the East and West markets,

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,320
the guild has decided to poison you.

91
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,530
I want you to play along with their scheme.

92
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,220
I understand, Your Highness.

93
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,320
Accept Xu Ziqi.

94
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,760
Reject Xu Ziqi.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,680
Accept Xu Ziqi.

96
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
Reject Xu Ziqi.

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,360
Love

98
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,200
is just like this bittersweet feeling.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,440
Xiaofei, I really like you so much.

100
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,559
I truly wish

101
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,140
I could meet you again in my next life.

102
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,679
Even if

103
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,960
even if you still bully me,

104
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,920
bully me to death,

105
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
bully me worse than in this life,

106
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,700
I would still want to love you.

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,560
Xu Ziqi.

108
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
I like you so much.

109
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
I want to touch your chest muscles

110
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
and your abs.

111
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Where did you go?

112
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,960
Xu Ziqi.

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,400
Xu Ziqi.

114
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,840
Hurry.

115
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,840
Hurry.

116
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
Xiaofei.

117
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,440
Xiaofei.

118
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,730
Xiaofei.

119
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,680
Xiaofei,

120
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,080
wake up.

121
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,280
What's wrong?

122
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,960
There's something I need to tell you.

123
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,400
What is it?

124
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,040
Xu Ziqi, he...

125
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
He's dead.

126
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
How is that possible?

127
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,180
Didn't we just see him yesterday?

128
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
He's really dead.

129
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
My God!

130
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Xu Ziqi...

131
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,800
Xiaofei.

132
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,560
Xiaofei.

133
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Xiaofei.

134
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,320
Xu Ziqi

135
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
is actually dead.

136
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,200
Actually dead.

137
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,480
Before he died,

138
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,960
the last time I saw him

139
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,920
was when we had a falling out.

140
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
I even punched him.

141
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,480
Yang Lin.

142
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,800
I punched Ziqi.

143
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,680
With all my strength.

144
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,160
Sir,

145
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,640
Master Xu

146
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,210
wouldn't blame you.

147
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,050
He knows your inner suffering.

148
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,730
He's getting revenge on me.

149
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,920
He just left like that.

150
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,080
I will never

151
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,200
ever be able to replace him

152
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
in Xiaofei's heart.

153
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,920
I'll never win Xiaofei's heart.

154
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
Yang Lin.

155
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
This is karma.

156
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,320
Sir,

157
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,960
you're talking nonsense from grief again.

158
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Xu Ziqi,

159
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,080
Xu Ziqi, you bastard.

160
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,730
You just left like this.

161
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
You really want to leave me all alone

162
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,040
in this world.

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,080
How could you leave so cleanly?

164
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,280
How could you?

165
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Sir, please control your grief.

166
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,400
Debiao fainted this morning

167
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,130
after hearing the news.

168
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,280
Then go take care of her quickly.

169
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Yes.

170
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
Xiaofei.

171
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
I'll never have you again.

172
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,040
Never have you again.

173
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Ziqi.

174
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,960
You've led yourself to a dead end.

175
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,200
Even I

176
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
am on this path of no return.

177
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,280
Miss Xiaofei,

178
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,820
this is our family's glass cup passed down for three generations.

179
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,260
This is Master Xu's

180
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,650
crossbow arrow he used when alive.

181
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,480
Everyone,

182
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
Master Xu's belongings

183
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,820
have all been distributed as keepsakes.

184
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,620
It's getting late.

185
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,330
Let's lift the coffin and be on our way.

186
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
I was ready to be with you.

187
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,080
How could you just be gone?

188
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,720
Everyone, please leave.

189
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,250
I want to spend some time with Ziqi.

190
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
This way, please.

191
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,280
Please.

192
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,560
All of you, leave as well.

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,280
I want to say goodbye to him in private.

194
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
Let's stay with Miss Xiaofei.

195
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,920
After all,

196
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,580
Mr. Xu is worried something might happen to her.

197
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,920
Then let's see him one last time.

198
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,440
One last look.

199
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,040
Something's wrong.

200
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,359
Heaven envies the talented.

201
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,760
Xu Ziqi,

202
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,280
why did you get no reward for being good?

203
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,000
Miss Xiaofei.

204
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,420
Something's definitely off.

205
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,200
With such poor acting,

206
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,600
you dare to perform in front of me?

207
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,440
All of you,

208
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,200
get up now.

209
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,010
Aren't you saying goodbye?

210
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,240
I think I've said

211
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,410
everything I needed to say.

212
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,280
Xiaofei,

213
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,520
what are you looking for?

214
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,240
Looking for nails.

215
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
To nail Xu Ziqi's coffin.

216
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,880
Don't you all need to nail coffins here?

217
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,290
No need, no need.

218
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,090
We don't have that custom here.

219
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
Passed down for three generations,

220
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,880
a family heirloom.

221
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,210
You're about to depart.

222
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,280
I know

223
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
this is your favorite glass cup.

224
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,400
A family heirloom passed down for three generations.

225
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,760
I'd rather give up my life

226
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
than part with this.

227
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I'll smash it to pieces right now.

228
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Let it scatter in the wind

229
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,680
and follow you.

230
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Xu Ziqi, rest in peace.

231
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,040
I'll smash it now.

232
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,280
You can't!

233
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,240
Someone come!

234
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,000
Hurry, come quickly!

235
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,000
Miss Xiaofei,

236
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,660
this was our boss's most treasured possession.

237
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,620
Can't you leave us something to remember him by?

238
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,120
Alright then.

239
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Very well.

240
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,490
Whenever we see this glass cup,

241
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,460
it'll be like seeing Xu Ziqi himself.

242
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,520
Holding this glass cup now,

243
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I feel like

244
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,440
Xu Ziqi isn't dead.

245
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,880
He's still alive,

246
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,000
always beside us.

247
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,680
It's getting late.

248
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,440
Everyone,

249
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,240
lift the coffin. Let's proceed.

250
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
Where's Xiaofei?

251
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,160
Miss Xiaofei.

252
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,290
Come.

253
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,180
Bring it in.

254
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,900
Put it here.

255
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,160
Alright, you two can go now.

256
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,760
Boss.

257
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Boss Xu.

258
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,440
Boss,

259
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,200
this Miss Xiaofei

260
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,300
really doesn't play by the rules.

261
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,160
She was this close

262
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,360
to smashing everything.

263
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,360
Luckily, we sacrificed ourselves

264
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,680
and saved all

265
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,720
the items.

266
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,570
Everything's in the boxes now.

267
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,240
Good that you saved them.

268
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,040
Go back now.

269
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,880
Well, boss,

270
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,720
take care of yourself.

271
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,920
Don't worry. Just go.

272
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Boss,

273
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,680
you're choking me. Let go.

274
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,200
Boss,

275
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,920
if you need anything in the future,

276
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
we're brothers,

277
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,360
just let us know.

278
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Okay.

279
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,360
I got it.

280
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
You should go now.

281
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,720
Xiaofei.

282
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,960
Xu Ziqi.

283
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
You're really alive.

284
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,770
You're still alive.

285
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,200
Yes,

286
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,530
I'm still alive.

287
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,300
You scared me to death.

288
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
I thought I'd never see you again.

289
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,200
Don't cry,

290
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,600
hey.

291
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
How dare you fake your death.

292
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,380
Look what you've done.

293
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,040
Pretending to be dead, huh?

294
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,240
Stop!

295
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,040
I'll kill you.

296
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,690
Do you know how terrified I was?

297
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,130
Don't act innocent,

298
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,420
you think you're in the right?

299
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,280
Why did you fake your death?

300
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
Why are you playing dead?

301
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm hiding here

302
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,680
so that no one finds me.

303
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,880
You're shouting so loudly.

304
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,540
Who are you trying to attract?

305
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
So,

306
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,730
why did you fake your death?

307
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,370
I can't tell you.

308
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,480
I already know you're alive,

309
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,210
and you still can't tell me?

310
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,020
A son must pay for his father's debts.

311
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,040
My enemies are hunting me down,

312
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,300
so I can only hide here.

313
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,960
Really?

314
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,440
Really.

315
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't believe a word of it.

316
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,720
Fine.

317
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,360
If you don't want to talk about it, I won't push you.

318
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,160
I'm tired.

319
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,200
But I thought I'd be living here alone,

320
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,170
so I only brought stuff for one person.

321
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,360
How about

322
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,480
we sleep together?

323
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
You sleep in the corner.

324
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,970
I'll sleep on the floor.

325
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,280
Go.

326
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,280
Go.

327
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,400
Go.

328
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,370
Turn around and face the wall to reflect on your actions.

329
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,200
Xiaofei,

330
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,880
the situation is dangerous right now.

331
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,680
Otherwise,

332
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,960
you should go back.

333
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
Say one more word and I'll hit you.

334
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,240
Xu Ziqi.

335
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,520
I'll be angry with you

336
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,360
for a very long time.

337
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,240
Although

338
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
I don't know why I'm so angry.

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
When I thought you were dead,

340
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,760
I was devastated.

341
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,620
But knowing you're alive,

342
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,480
I feel so confused

343
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,420
and want to hit you.

344
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,440
What are you confused about?

345
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,480
I don't know.

346
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,660
Just really confused, extremely confused.

347
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,880
Well,

348
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,260
why don't you hit me again to feel better?

349
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,620
Go to sleep.

350
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,240
Get some rest

351
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,620
and I'll hit you tomorrow.

352
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,960
Then

353
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,880
I'll rest up too,

354
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
so you can hit me properly tomorrow.

355
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,960
Your Majesty,

356
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,500
a message has arrived by carrier pigeon.

357
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,680
Good.

358
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,240
This Xu Ziqi

359
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,960
is indeed reliable.

360
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,520
As soon as he died,

361
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,440
the guild immediately sent

362
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,960
such a large shipment of goods from Luoyang to Chang'an.

363
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,240
Xiaofei.

364
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Xiaofei.

365
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,760
Come, I'll show you a surprise.

366
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,440
I came in a sedan chair yesterday

367
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,210
I didn't expect it to be so beautiful out here.

368
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,260
Have a seat.

369
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,120
How is it?

370
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,380
It's very nice.

371
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,680
After what you told me that day,

372
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,120
I searched throughout Chang'an

373
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,810
before finding this place.

374
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
Classic and elegant,

375
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,260
with birdsong and fragrant flowers.

376
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,640
Originally,

377
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,120
this house was meant to be your betrothal gift.

378
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,810
Betrothal gift?

379
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,960
I had planned

380
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,010
to propose to you the moment you were crowned the top courtesan.

381
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,680
But due to unfortunate circumstances,

382
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,740
it never happened.

383
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,340
Then you were with Fang Lihen.

384
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,680
Anyway, after that,

385
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,680
I kept this house,

386
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,240
as a memento.

387
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,440
Why didn't you sell it

388
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,240
to get money for An Pingle?

389
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,720
I thought

390
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,480
I might never see you again.

391
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,840
Having this house here

392
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,440
at least made me feel like I was with you.

393
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,490
So after faking your death,

394
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,440
you planned to hide here forever?

395
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,040
Yes.

396
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,840
When I'm living here,

397
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,700
it feels as if I'm with you.

398
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,600
Xu Ziqi.

399
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,360
I forgive you.

400
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,930
At the same time,

401
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,640
I've made a decision.

402
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,920
I want to be your woman.

403
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,200
Forget about your high position,

404
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,600
forget about his wealth.

405
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,290
I don't want any of that.

406
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,040
I, Hua Xiaofei,

407
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
only want you.

408
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,740
You can have me.

409
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,610
The night you had the accident,

410
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,680
I had already decided

411
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
to be with you.

412
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,160
When I heard you were dead,

413
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,720
I was dying with regret.

414
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,120
I hated myself

415
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,160
for not agreeing earlier

416
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
to be with you.

417
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,000
So from now on,

418
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,060
I'll never leave you, no matter what.

419
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,440
Look,

420
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,120
I've seen your body

421
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
completely naked.

422
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,500
Your innocence is ruined by my hands.

423
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
I've kissed you

424
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,440
and touched what I shouldn't have.

425
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
You're mine now,

426
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,440
understand?

427
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Pinky promise. No one can back out.

428
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,840
So,

429
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,600
what should we do next?

430
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,760
This is my first relationship too,

431
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,420
I don't have much experience.

432
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
But books say

433
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,720
someone strong like you

434
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,080
should grab me like a domineering warrior.

435
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,960
Grab you?

436
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,680
Like,

437
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,160
pin me against the wall

438
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,280
and kiss me.

439
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,360
Kiss me now.

440
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,240
Like this?

441
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,840
I said pin, not slam, bro.

442
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,680
Then I'll try again.

443
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,520
Forget it.

444
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,170
Just do it directly.

445
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,810
How do I kiss you?

446
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,280
The book says

447
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,440
if you want to show me how much you love me,

448
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,960
then kiss me for that long.

449
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,000
I can't breathe!

450
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,480
Isn't kissing wonderful?

451
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,170
Very wonderful.

452
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,680
Isn't being lifted up wonderful too?

453
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,450
Very wonderful.

454
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,520
Isn't hugging wonderful as well?

455
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,690
Very wonderful.

456
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,810
Then from now on,

457
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,400
we'll kiss, hug and lift every day.

458
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,440
Okay.

459
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,200
The tens of thousands of gold taels hidden in the fabric

460
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,730
have all been confiscated.

461
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,960
Are the four of us expected to cover this loss?

462
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,160
We're talking about tens of thousands of gold taels,

463
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,120
not silver.

464
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,900
Who can afford to pay that?

465
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,120
I've just finished building my house in the suburbs.

466
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,240
As you all know,

467
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,880
I can't contribute much money.

468
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,280
None of you deserve to call yourselves men.

469
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,120
At this critical moment,

470
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,720
our priority is to find out

471
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,680
who leaked this information.

472
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,960
Yet here you are discussing who will cover the loss.

473
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,600
You're all blinded by money.

474
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Utterly foolish.

475
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,000
I'll cover the money.

476
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,360
You will?

477
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
That's tens of thousands of gold taels.

478
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,280
If we offend Official Wu,

479
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,880
we'll lose more than just money.

480
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,040
Our lives.

481
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,170
As for the money,

482
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,520
we should work together

483
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,840
and share the burden.

484
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,010
I'll contribute 50,000 taels of gold.

485
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
I'll also contribute 50,000 taels.

486
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,440
I'll contribute 30,000 taels.

487
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,370
The account book is still missing.

488
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,840
Whatever you say or do now,

489
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,800
I can no longer trust any of you.

490
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,239
If the account book falls into

491
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,920
any one of your hands,

492
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,850
with your pathetic character,

493
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,159
you would certainly keep it for yourself.

494
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,960
Until the account book is found,

495
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,360
I will handle all trade matters myself.

496
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,090
None of you will interfere.

497
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,420
All of you, get out!

498
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,880
These four elders are really something else.

499
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,240
They used their own money

500
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,800
to cover Minister Wu's deficit,

501
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,130
and now they're demanding money from you.

502
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
The imperial court has already posted a notice

503
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,120
that they confiscated 130,000 taels of gold in total.

504
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,180
Can you believe it?

505
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
These four people together

506
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
are demanding an amount

507
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,340
exceeding 200,000 taels.

508
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,380
It's absolutely outrageous.

509
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,810
Elder Yi has already informed me in her letter

510
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,760
that she's taken away all the actual power

511
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,490
from the other three old fools.

512
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,690
These three elders all want money,

513
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,360
but I won't give them any.

514
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Take 100,000 taels of gold from our treasury

515
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,250
and send it to Elder Yi tonight.

516
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,040
What?

517
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,060
One hundred

518
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,440
thousand taels of gold?

519
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,840
My lord,

520
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,090
that will leave me with a huge deficit.

521
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,020
Increase the merchant taxes.

522
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,280
Tomorrow,

523
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,400
we'll discuss with Minister Liu

524
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,970
to quickly issue new regulations.

525
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,160
Increasing taxes is a major matter.

526
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,820
Can Minister Liu handle this?

527
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,320
This year's taxes are already quite heavy.

528
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,980
I fear the common people cannot bear it, my lord.

529
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,880
Minister Liu has been taking money from our guild for years

530
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
until his hands are sore.

531
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,440
He won't refuse to help with this matter.

532
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,100
Every year, they say the people can't afford it,

533
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,320
but our merchant taxes are already so high,

534
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,980
and yet they manage to bear it.

535
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,680
What's more important is

536
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,770
if we don't collect money from the people,

537
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,290
how can we send silver up the chain?

538
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Father and Mother

539
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,720
won't come back.

540
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,880
Ziqi

541
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,320
is already gone.

542
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,020
Little Fei will never return either.

543
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,220
I only have Father and Mother now.

544
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,900
I need to bring them back as soon as possible.

545
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,640
Come.

546
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,360
Xiaofei.

547
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,960
What is it?

548
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,440
Thank you.

549
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,280
I

550
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,040
finally feel like I have a home now.

551
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,280
Silly. I should thank you too.

552
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,520
I finally have a proper home.

553
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,280
But

554
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,280
I have no money now.

555
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,220
Are you really willing

556
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
to be with someone like me who has nothing,

557
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,120
someone who can't even show his face in public?

558
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,960
Xu Ziqi,

559
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,240
none of that matters.

560
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,000
When you hold my hand,

561
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,760
I feel that

562
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,440
having you by my side

563
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,240
is all that matters.

564
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,160
Xiaofei!

565
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,890
Xiaofei, are you there?

566
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,240
I'll go check.

567
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,770
Xiaofei.

568
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,000
Xiaofei!

569
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,040
Miss Xiaofei, are you home?

570
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,760
Xiaofei!

571
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,720
They must have the wrong place.

572
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,000
No, that's not possible.

573
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,360
Tu Da and Jia Ding told us

574
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,800
that Brother Xu's last wish

575
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,840
was to leave this property to Xiaofei.

576
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
We can't find Xiaofei anywhere in Chang'an.

577
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
She must be here.

578
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,320
Could she have taken her life out of grief?

579
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,520
Xiaofei.

580
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,120
Xiaofei! Xiaofei!

581
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,560
Xiaofei.

582
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,410
What are you all doing here?

583
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,440
Xiaofei.

584
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,760
You have quite an appetite.

585
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,000
I need to take care of myself.

586
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,640
Eat more. I need to stay strong.

587
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,520
8 hot dishes.

588
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,760
2 cold dishes and a soup.

589
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
Xiaofei.

590
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,640
You're eating way too much.

591
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080
Turning grief into appetite.

592
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,970
The more sadness I feel,

593
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,440
the more I eat.

594
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,960
How did you find this place?

595
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
You disappeared after the funeral.

596
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,360
Tu and Jiading told us

597
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,040
this place is the inheritance Mr. Xu left you.

598
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,440
So we came to see

599
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,450
if you were here.

600
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,560
That's right.

601
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Xu Ziqi bought it.

602
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Isn't it amazing?

603
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Elegant and exquisite,

604
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,120
birds singing among flowers.

605
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,320
It's exactly the house of my dreams.

606
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,400
Miss Xiaofei,

607
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,320
you look so cheerful.

608
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,360
Why aren't you sad at all?

609
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm sad.

610
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,760
I want to cry.

611
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,760
I was happy to see you all so cheerful,

612
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,880
but why did you have to reopen my wounds?

613
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,720
I'm just putting on a brave face,

614
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,520
hiding my pain.

615
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,160
After all, this place

616
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,440
is the last thing Xu Ziqi left me.

617
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,720
I need to start a new life here.

618
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,640
Xiaofei.

619
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,000
You're being

620
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,840
way too dramatic.

621
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,160
Really?

622
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,140
You don't understand.

623
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,360
After Xu Ziqi left,

624
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,720
I've been living in a nightmare I can't wake up from.

625
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,320
I still can't believe

626
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,160
he's gone.

627
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,440
Everything feels like an illusion,

628
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,480
neither real nor fake.

629
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,320
I can't accept it.

630
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,320
I just can't.

631
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,000
Xiaofei, I understand how you feel.

632
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,080
Because I can't accept it either.

633
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,400
He's gone.

634
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,840
How could he just leave like that?

635
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,240
When he was alive,

636
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,400
I had already expressed my feelings to him many times.

637
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,240
I have no regrets.

638
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,480
But you and he never ended up together.

639
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,720
You might regret it for the rest of your life.

640
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,000
He said...

641
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,720
Xiaofei,

642
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,880
Xu Ziqi's spirit in heaven

643
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,680
will understand your feelings.

644
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,560
Xiaofei, he's already gone.

645
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,920
Try to let it go.

646
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,880
Take care of yourself.

647
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,920
Be happy.

648
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,080
Otherwise, Mr. Xu won't be at ease.

649
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,760
Yes.

650
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,520
I've tried.

651
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,600
I've tried so hard.

652
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,800
But I just can't forget.

653
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
I can't do it.

654
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,850
I know you can't forget him.

655
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,090
I specially made this memorial portrait for him.

656
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,160
So you can

657
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,520
see him every day.

658
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,460
That's thoughtful of you.

659
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Let's pay our respects to Brother Xu

660
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,930
with three bows.

661
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,600
Brother Xu,

662
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,560
rest in peace.

663
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,480
We will take good care of Xiaofei.

664
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,920
Official Xu,

665
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,320
may you have a peaceful journey.

666
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,720
Sir.

667
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,440
You'll always be in our hearts.

668
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,000
Official Xu,

669
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,920
may you rest in peace.

670
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,000
I hope Xu Ziqi finds no poison in heaven.

671
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,120
May there be no poison in heaven.

672
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,120
Xiaofei.

673
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,560
We'll take our leave now.

674
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,220
Take care of yourself.

675
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,520
We'll come to see you often.

676
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,960
Okay.

677
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,080
No need.

678
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,480
I want to be alone here for a while.

679
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
We understand.

680
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,440
But don't overthink things when you're alone.

681
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,640
Talk to us anytime if you need anything.

682
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,600
Also,

683
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,800
there's a good way to ease your grief.

684
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,080
Continue your beauty business.

685
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,720
We'll be with you.

686
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,330
Just take care of yourself.

687
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:09,960
Right.

688
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,360
I need to continue my beauty business.

689
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,960
I've been so busy lately that I forgot about it.

690
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,440
Xiaofei,

691
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,600
take good care of yourself.

692
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,400
I understand.

693
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,280
You should go now.

694
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,400
Xiaofei,

695
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,400
take care.

696
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:25,930
Alright.

697
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,000
Just go.

698
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:27,890
Hurry up.

699
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,520
It's okay.

700
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,400
Go now.

701
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm fine.

702
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
I need some space.

703
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,720
Take care of yourself.
