1
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,160
Say it. Say it.

2
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,880
to leave the Chamber of Commerce

3
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,240
to leave the Chamber of Commerce to benefit the people.

4
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
It's all a lie.

5
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,360
She's also a phony.

6
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,600
who likes vanity.

7
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,240
My lord.

8
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,860
Did you drink? Yes.

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,960
Did you drink?

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Just a drink.

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
It's okay

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
Debull, may I ask

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
May I have a drink with you?

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,320
My lord.

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,240
A man must keep his word.

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
My lord promised to travel with Debuo.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,079
I don't know if I can do it.

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Are you waiting for your love?

19
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,240
Okay.

20
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
Let's drink together.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,820
I'm not in the government office.

22
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,960
or the camp.

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,600
There's no one at home.

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
It's here.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,960
Where is Xu Ziqi?

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,240
Come on.

27
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Cheers.

28
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,840
Let's drink.

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,660
Aren't you going after Ms. Zheng?

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,970
Why would I go after her?

31
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,480
The man she's looking for

32
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,040
is not me.

33
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
It's getting dark.

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,060
It's not safe for you to be outside alone.

35
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Go home now.

36
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
This is Deok-biao's first time drinking.

37
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
It's said to boost courage by drinking.

38
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,440
After drinking this wine today,

39
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,860
I want to ask you one last time.

40
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
As you know,

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,520
Deibiao has fallen for you for a long time.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,360
So does Deibiao still have a chance?

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,120
Depiao.

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,440
You're a very nice girl.

45
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
But

46
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,730
I still love Hua Xiao Zheng.

47
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,240
Although

48
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
have different paths,

49
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
But...

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
I don't know

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
when I can let her go.

52
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,840
I can't give you hope.

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,680
This is my rule.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,060
Do you understand?

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
Thank you for your words.

56
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,560
Got it.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,400
By the way,

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
But are you willing

59
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,640
to bid farewell to Miss Xiao?

60
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,580
Aren't you afraid of misunderstanding?

61
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,650
What else do you have to say?

62
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,360
Even if we break up,

63
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,680
we should make it clear.

64
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
Deok-Biao is willing

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,320
Zheng.

66
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,680
You're amazing.

67
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,210
It's all thanks to everyone

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
It's all thanks to everyone.

69
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
We'll open soon.

70
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,560
I'll get you a glass of water.

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,200
Take a rest later.

72
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,120
Ms. Zheng.

73
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Miss Xiao Zheng.

74
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
Miss Yang.

75
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,760
This is a very important letter.

76
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,440
I have to give it to you myself.

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,080
Well...

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,240
Please put it on the counter.

79
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,640
in my bag.

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm a little busy right now.

81
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,440
Be careful.

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,730
Hello, Mr. Bang.

83
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Higher on the left.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,560
Right.

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Right?

86
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,320
Remember to read it.

87
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,240
Okay, don't worry.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll get back to work.

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Right.

90
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,120
Okay. Okay.

91
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,200
OK.

92
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,640
I think we can

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,560
more new products.

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
For example, brows,

95
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,080
lipstick,

96
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,760
Rouge.

97
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,050
I think there are too few types now.

98
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,760
Zheng.

99
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,560
Your face

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,130
black and dizzy.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,340
Where is it?

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,130
I'll wipe it off for you.

103
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,120
Done.

104
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,000
It's clean.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,360
Okay.

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,730
Let’s go.

107
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,440
Yang Lin is very busy recently.

108
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,980
He has no time to worry about the family affairs.

109
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Steward Yang.

110
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,450
What is he busy with?

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
He's busy preparing his dowry.

112
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,440
dowry?

113
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Yang Lin told me

114
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,799
De Biao and Brother Xu have been in pairs recently.

115
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,480
When Xu was dismissed,

116
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,920
he was comforting and encouraging by his side.

117
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,200
So I want to find Brother Xu.

118
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,980
and pick a date to get engaged.

119
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,400
So soon?

120
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,700
They've known each other for a long time.

121
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,800
Maybe

122
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
this is fate.

123
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,680
Why is it snowing in autumn?

124
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,920
The weather in Chang'an is so strange this year.

125
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,920
Exactly.

126
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
Have you heard that

127
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,040
there is another

128
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,460
The clear sky is splitting lightning

129
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,960
A girl was struck.

130
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,600
I wonder if she was killed.

131
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Look at so many strange things.

132
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,280
Is there a demon?

133
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,960
It suddenly snowed.

134
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,400
So I came to see it.

135
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
I told you

136
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
the snow here

137
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,540
is the most beautiful.

138
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,280
You also said

139
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,340
if it's the first snow,

140
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,800
let's watch it here.

141
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,020
About the flowers.

142
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,080
It's okay.

144
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,080
We will find a way to solve it.

145
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,560
You will.

146
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,800
I always set you up.

147
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,300
It's rare for you to trick me once.

148
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,960
Yeah.

149
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,530
How many times have you tricked me?

150
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,680
You saw my body

151
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,480
and ruined my innocence.

152
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,080
I was demoted and punished.

153
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,080
and got flogged dozens of times.

154
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,280
and made money

155
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
to make dirty money.

156
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,320
Later I found out

157
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,680
you stole milk milk tea

158
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,640
you went to rob the cow alone.

159
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,960
and hurt yourself.

160
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,880
It's good that you won the competition.

161
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,320
Then you fell out with the Chamber of Commerce.

162
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,200
and quit being the Oiran.

163
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,300
You did nothing wrong.

164
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,720
You made the right choice.

165
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,290
It's snowy and cold.

166
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,010
Warm your hands.

167
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
Think about it.

168
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,540
We've been through so much together.

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
Yeah.

170
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,160
I also find it unbelievable.

171
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,330
It's only been a few months,

172
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,460
It's like a decade has passed.

173
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,840
Xiao Zheng.

174
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,280
From now on,

175
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,400
in the future.

176
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,960
Xu Ziqi.

177
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,160
You too.

178
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,160
Take care.

179
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,600
Miss, what's wrong?

180
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,320
Wei, go get a doctor.

181
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,400
It's been three days.

182
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,780
The fever is finally gone.

183
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,440
He fainted after three days of fever.

184
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,200
Three days.

185
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,200
and cried for three days.

186
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,680
Zheng.

187
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,560
Where am I?

188
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,960
Who am I?

189
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,080
Zheng.

190
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Did you burn for three days?

191
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,410
Are you out of your mind?

192
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,680
Zheng.

193
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
You and Xu Ziqi

194
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,520
as a dream.

195
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,490
I woke up for a long time.

196
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm still touched.

197
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,119
I still want to be protected by you.

198
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,440
The pain in my heart

199
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,960
Don't worry. The world is big.

200
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,760
But I remember what you said.

201
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,960
What?

202
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
Get up early

203
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,480
Embracing the sun

204
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,040
Make life

205
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,120
full of positive energy.

206
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,840
Full of positive energy.

207
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,440
Guys.

208
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,960
Let's work hard together.

209
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,280
Work hard, humble, grateful

210
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,640
Keep fighting for the dream.

211
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,440
Come on! Come on!

212
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,680
Xiao Zheng.

213
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,360
We know Lord Xu

214
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,760
will be very stimulating to you.

215
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,400
Adjust for a few days.

216
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,960
You don't have to act tough.

217
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,160
Although I've been burning these days,

218
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,760
my mind

219
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,520
thinking about the shop.

220
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,210
Haven't you been crying

221
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,960
these days?

222
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,900
The flowers are wrong.

223
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
It's snowing now.

224
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,600
we can't

225
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
in a short time.

226
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
The shop is open.

227
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,180
and the signboard is gone.

228
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,200
I can't just do nothing.

229
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,680
So,

230
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,200
I came up with a wonderful idea.

231
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
It's shameless,

232
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,480
but there must be a way to attract attention.

233
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,440
What is it?

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
Let's look for

235
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,160
the hottest and popular shop.

236
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
Try everything you can

237
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,100
to blackmail them.

238
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,440
Why does it sound like

239
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,840
you'll be beaten to death?

240
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,700
It's okay. She'll take the punch.

241
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,760
It does sound feasible.

242
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
I took a few days off.

243
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,360
You don't know

244
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,680
my passion of work

245
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,480
is about to drown me.

246
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,640
It's been a long time.

247
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
It's not our turn yet.

248
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah.

249
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,360
Excuse me.

250
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,400
Move!

251
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,160
Excuse me.

252
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,480
What's wrong with him?

253
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:55,880
Cut the queue.

254
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,400
Boss.

255
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,200
Make the most popular product

256
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,360
one by one.

257
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
OK, wait a moment.

258
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,280
Fascinating.

259
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

260
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,880
That's all.

261
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,400
It's here.

262
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,860
What do you think of the color?

263
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,880
Ji’s Ran Workshop.

264
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,680
The top three cosmetics shops in the west market

265
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,720
The annual dyed armor sales are the best in Chang'an.

266
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,840
It has always been colourful.

267
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,480
The ingredients are natural as the foundation of my career.

268
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
Seeing you today,

269
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,960
I've heard so much about you.

270
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,970
What does this mean?

271
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,400
This...

272
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,680
It's just natural.

273
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Do you have some misunderstanding about pure nature?

274
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
Smell it.

275
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,520
The smell of the medicine

276
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,280
Is this the scent of flowers?

277
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,920
Can I vaguely smell

278
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,560
of low quality cinnabar?

279
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,960
is the fragrance of mud.

280
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,000
Ji said flowers come from the soil.

281
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,840
So it smells like mud.

282
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,690
But this is the problem.

283
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,760
Didn't your family clean the soil

284
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,720
before making the soil?

285
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,120
Well...

286
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,240
There's only one reason.

287
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,960
This is not a natural flower dyeing armor.

288
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,360
It contains a lot of low quality cinnabar.

289
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,500
That’s why you can leave color on your nails for so long.

290
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,640
You all know cinnabar, right?

291
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,960
You’ll die if you eat too much.

292
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,920
Ji, are you serious?

293
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,640
To make such a product?

294
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
You...

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Stop talking nonsense.

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,640
Let me tell you.

297
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,770
Don't listen to her.

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
I don't even know where she came from.

299
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,680
Nonsense.

300
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,280
Don't believe her!

301
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,160
Don't trust her.

302
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,120
Trust me. Trust me.

303
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,240
Move.

304
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,180
Excuse me. Stop fighting.

305
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,360
Stop!

306
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,880
Stop! Stop!

307
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,360
Stop it!

308
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,260
Alright, let's go.

309
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,400
Back off.

310
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,200
Didn't you have a fever for several days?

311
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,400
How could you come out and make trouble?

312
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
I've been lying in bed for a few days.

313
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm fine.

314
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,420
Didn't you just lose your job?

315
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
Why did you come out to torture people so soon?

316
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,490
It's none of your business.

317
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Come with me to the government office.

318
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,290
I'm not making trouble.

319
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,280
They are selling counterfeits.

320
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,450
I'm trying to reason with them.

321
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,300
You want to bring me to the police?

322
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,280
Guess who will go to jail

323
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
was me or them?

324
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,100
It's me.

325
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,280
It's just a small matter. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

326
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,160
I won't report it to the government.

327
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,600
Sorry to trouble you.

328
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
You found a new job.

329
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
Then make more money.

330
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,880
Don't live a tight life

331
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
and have a baby.

332
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,360
You're so rude.

333
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
Can't you just hope I'm good?

334
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,090
After we go home,

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,880
make some lotus seed soup to cool down.

336
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Remember to take care of the lotus seeds.

337
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,520
Add some goji berries to warm it up.

338
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,200
Eat more sweet food

339
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,260
so that your mouth won't sound so bad.

340
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,640
What do you think you are?

341
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,420
Just because you're good,

342
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,680
You always take people on the street.

343
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,720
Your clothes and pants

344
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,680
step on the corner and walk smoothly.

345
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,480
Don't fall on him

346
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
and fall on him.

347
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,240
Can you afford it if it's broken?

348
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,520
I...

349
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,060
Let's go. Let's go.

350
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,200
Let's go.

351
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,720
Don't go.

352
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,640
What are you doing?

353
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,120
To maintain world peace.

354
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,530
For love and justice

355
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,640
I come to East and West City every day.

356
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,600
A bully.

357
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,440
Don't stop me.

358
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,040
Every morning at 9 a.m.

359
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,610
What time was it?

360
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,840
When?

361
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,080
Chen o'clock,

362
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,840
I will come to challenge you.

363
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,680
Don't stop me.

364
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,960
As the captain of the security team,

365
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,240
it’s my duty to

366
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
is my duty.

367
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
I won't let you go!

368
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,120
Let's fight to the death!

369
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,920
Sure.

370
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,440
Let's fight to the death.

371
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,960
But I have to go on patrol at seven.

372
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,090
How about 9 o'clock?

373
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,360
Follow your time.

374
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,400
I'll come back after breakfast.

375
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,300
Let's wait and see.

376
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,440
You scoundrel.

377
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,720
Just you wait.

378
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,920
You bad guy!

379
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,290
Where are you going?

380
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,440
Stop!

381
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,400
Stop!

382
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,880
You still want to run?

383
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Do you know selling fake wine will kill people?

384
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
Unscrupulous businessman.

385
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,280
How much did you get from selling fake liquor?

386
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,160
That's right.

387
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,580
You're heartless.

388
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,280
Unscrupulous!

389
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,920
Come out!

390
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,400
You're in our way, aren't you?

391
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,760
Sisters, go!

392
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,520
We can't do this business at all.

393
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
The customers need to return them

394
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,880
That's right. We've lost all the money.

395
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,760
We can't afford it.

396
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
He smashed the shop when he came.

397
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,180
He moved all the valuable things away

398
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,680
and beat him up.

399
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,840
The security team

400
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,720
is just a planner.

401
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,600
He doesn't dare to be cruel every time.

402
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,400
He didn't dare to take Hua Xiao Zheng to the police.

403
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,970
Exactly.

404
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,460
Why can't we report it to the government?

405
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,200
It's all because of you.

406
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,120
If you see the officials,

407
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,100
Everyone has to go in and squat

408
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,160
At this time,

409
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
you can't just stand and talk.

410
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,160
We businessmen

411
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,680
pay so much money to the Chamber of Commerce every year.

412
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,760
This is a big deal.

413
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,840
You can't let us

414
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
find the reason

415
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,480
to solve the problem.

416
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I'll take care of this.

417
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
I'll take care of Hua Xiaochi.

418
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,200
But after I'm done, the East and West City is peaceful,

419
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,400
Guess if you can still work here.

420
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,240
Elder Yi and some elders.

421
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
I offended you on impulse.

422
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,680
Please forgive me.

423
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Don’t worry. I’ll pay you

424
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,680
I'll pay you double this year.

425
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,360
Double. Double.

426
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,120
Double. Double.

427
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,680
Double.

428
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,440
Get out.

429
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,960
I've made my attitude clear.

430
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,920
standing here one by one.

431
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,530
Are you demonstrating?

432
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,000
No, no, no.

433
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,680
I dare not.

434
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,920
Let's go.

435
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
Hurry up.

436
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Separate hatred.

437
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,840
Have you signed the shop and contract?

438
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,960
Yes.

439
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,680
Okay, let her be.

440
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,240
It's time.

441
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,040
Let's go to the bottom. Okay.

442
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

443
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,360
Remember,

444
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,440
You have to act well before the last step.

445
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,480
Don't make her suspicious.

446
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,040
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

447
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,570
Yes, sir.

448
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,400
Do you know

449
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,640
is now?

450
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,960
Xu Ziqi.

451
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,120
They are lovey-dovey together every day.

452
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,720
This room is full of hatred.

453
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,040
is still thinking about Hua Xiaochi.

454
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,240
Chairman Bang heard what the elders said

455
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,440
and left in a hurry.

456
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,900
Let's go. Okay.

457
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,480
Yes.

458
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,980
Let's go! Let's go!

459
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,960
Next,

460
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,920
we should eliminate these ants and insects.

461
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,280
Here, Jin'er.

462
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,760
Zheng.

463
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:38,960
What?

464
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,440
Are you still seeing Xu Ziqi?

465
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,840
We meet every day, right?

466
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,920
Didn't he find a new job in East and West City?

467
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,520
We just met.

468
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,280
Did we meet

469
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,220
or did you do it on purpose?

470
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,970
Separate hatred

471
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,360
Whether it's a coincidence or intentional,

472
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
it has nothing to do with you.

473
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,530
Then why do you make such a big noise

474
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
in the Western Market every day?

475
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,840
Why?

476
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
I'm trying to destroy a fake product.

477
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,960
Let go of me!

478
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
You hurt me.

479
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,600
I give you money from the shop,

480
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,960
not to trouble the Chamber of Commerce.

481
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,690
but also get involved with Xu Ziqi behind my back.

482
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,720
I made it clear that day.

483
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,720
I didn't take your shop and money for nothing.

484
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I'll pay you back.

485
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
You were there too.

486
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,290
You can testify, right?

487
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Separate hatred.

488
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,960
I don't want to quarrel with you for three days.

489
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
and quarrel with you every two days.

490
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,480
Didn't you support me to start my own business?

491
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,280
I still have a lot of things to do.

492
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,260
I can't be distracted by these things every day.

493
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,140
What else do you want to do?

494
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,720
to meet Xu Ziqi?

495
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,640
He's getting engaged to Yang Debiao.

496
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,360
Why are you still entangled with him?

497
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,600
Have you no shame?

498
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,880
My love for you

499
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,660
has never changed.

500
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,280
Xu Ziqi doesn't love you.

501
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,680
Stay with me.

502
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,680
Let's work hard together.

503
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,200
and do what you want.

504
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,640
One more thing.

505
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,920
You are still a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

506
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,000
Those sellers in the West Market

507
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,640
are also from the Chamber of Commerce.

508
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,360
How can you do this?

509
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,560
give others a way out?

510
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,660
What will the Chamber of Commerce do?

511
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,000
And this store is the Chamber of Commerce’s territory.

512
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,060
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

513
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,130
What do you mean?

514
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,360
I said I'll be quick.

515
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
as soon as possible.

516
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,600
I'll pay you back in seven days.

517
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,720
One more thing.

518
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,280
I have announced the breakdown with the Chamber of Commerce.

519
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,960
I won't make a big deal out of this.

520
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,920
Because you are still in the Chamber of Commerce.

521
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,250
I don't want everyone in Chang'an to know.

522
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,640
It's not good for you.

523
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,440
Zheng.

524
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,200
You're too naive.

525
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,140
You're a merchant now.

526
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,040
you will be controlled by the Chamber of Commerce.

527
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,360
You can't defeat the Chamber of Commerce.

528
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Why don't we find a way to reconcile

529
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,040
before the announcement is announced.

530
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,400
Leave.

531
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,720
The Chamber of Commerce must pay back the money.

532
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,520
But where can we get so much money?

533
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,040
They're talking big.

534
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,200
What should we do with these flowers?

535
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,040
It's so white.

536
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,920
My head hurts.

537
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,920
No.

538
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Snow White!

539
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,200
Snow White!

540
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,360
White white.

541
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,760
Let's take a look.

542
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,680
Which one is bigger?

543
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,640
Two are the same size.

544
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Just white.

545
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,880
It can make people amplify.

546
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,400
So you think your faces

547
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,730
not big or round enough.

548
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,480
Don't miss it.

549
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,960
The newly launched

550
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,440
Pure cosmetics.

551
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,280
This...

552
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,120
What is this?

553
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,920
What kind of new product is this?

554
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,360
Our pink

555
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,040
is pearl powder.

556
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
instead of toxic meteorite.

557
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,040
and the white petals that have never been polluted.

558
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,560
Now let's see the color effect.

559
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,719
Let's welcome our model and makeup artist.

560
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,960
Okay.

561
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,360
Jin'er's face is goose face.

562
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,199
Although the lines are soft,

563
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,560
but not round enough.

564
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,219
Girls, attention.

565
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,040
Apply the white evenly on her cheekbone

566
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,440
and the edge of her chin.

567
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,960
Then dye it.

568
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,920
Let's see the effect.

569
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,360
Is it round in an instant?

570
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
So round.

571
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,840
It's really round.

572
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,600
It's really round.

573
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,159
Yes

574
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,040
It's round.

575
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,080
You can't see the fans.

576
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,120
No flour.

577
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,160
It looks like my face is always round.

578
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,240
Yes.

579
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,640
Our first makeup product

580
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,040
The white declaration is

581
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,120
I'm always round.

582
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Let's have a round round round

583
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
The tender round.

584
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,920
Round round.

585
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
It's a big sale today.

586
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
Buy two pieces. 10% off.

587
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,960
20% off if you buy three.

588
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,280
Buy five and get one free.

589
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
If you want to buy it, come and buy it.

590
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,800
Everyone has it.

591
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,120
What's wrong?

592
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,440
Look.

593
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,800
Here we go. Here we go.

594
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,640
We don't have enough goods, right?

595
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,720
We need replenishment. We need replenishment.

596
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,240
OK. OK.

597
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,980
Take a look.

598
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,960
Hua Xiao Zheng, the beauty of the Chamber of Commerce Award.

599
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,020
Start the new shop!

600
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,560
Be successful!

601
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,880
and benefit the people.

602
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,880
Each of the four Elders

603
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,760
to write this plaque.

604
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
to Hua Xiaochi.

605
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,040
90 yuan.

606
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,360
Fifty cents, please.

607
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,640
Xiao Zheng.

608
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,400
Take this plaque.

609
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,560
You won the first battle.

610
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,160
The four Elders are pleased

611
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,320
They are willing to give you

612
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,960
for free.

613
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,140
I will support your business from now on.

614
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,560
And even taxes

615
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,220
will give a high discount.

616
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,640
A genius from the Chamber of Commerce.

617
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,500
What are you doing?

618
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Are you trying to embarrass me in public?

619
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,720
in public?

620
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,040
You pushed me first.

621
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
You always push me forward.

622
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,800
Are you threatening me?

623
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,920
All right.

624
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,560
Go. Go.

625
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Don't go.

626
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,520
Since this has happened,

627
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,560
let's make it clear.

628
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,520
Xu Ziqi.

629
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,800
Li!

630
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,930
Don't embarrass everyone.

631
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,760
At this point,

632
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,290
why don't we just do what Xiao Zheng wants?

633
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,240
You really chose her.

634
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,080
For her,

635
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,400
for her.

636
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,960
I didn't choose her.

637
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,930
I chose to fight with the Chamber of Commerce.

638
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
For so many years,

639
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,160
how many times have I persuaded you?

640
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,240
Have you ever heard

641
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,500
Don't you understand my difficulty?

642
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,580
Don't use your love

643
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
as an excuse.

644
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,160
You like Hua Xiaochi.

645
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
I do.

646
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,440
but I want to protect you too.

647
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,840
I don't want to hear that.

648
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,840
During the Oiran Competition,

649
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,240
you supported Hua Xiaochi

650
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,370
It's hard for me to stand in the middle.

651
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,440
Did you ever think about my situation

652
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,560
have you ever thought about my situation?

653
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,890
You support Hua Xiaochi

654
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,000
against the Chamber of Commerce.

655
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,400
Do you know how much I suffered?

656
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,170
Brotherhood for years.

657
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,600
and life and death.

658
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,960
For a woman,

659
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,280
for a woman?

660
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,000
[I once...]

661
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,440
I once

662
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,320
to protect you.

663
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,960
to protect you.

664
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,360
Even now.

665
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,360
But you have to know

666
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,960
I've been dismissed.

667
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm not that capable

668
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,240
to protect you.

669
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,010
You need to learn to protect yourself.

670
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,340
I don't need anyone to protect me.

671
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,770
Whoever goes against me

672
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,520
is my enemy.

673
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,080
You want to be my enemy?

674
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,840
Li,

675
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,560
When did you become so extreme?

676
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
I have something

677
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
I have to explain to you.

678
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
I

679
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,440
have completely left the Chamber of Commerce.

680
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,440
All my business behaviors

681
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,120
has nothing to do with the Chamber of Commerce.

682
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,920
I'm no longer the Oiran of the Chamber of Commerce.

683
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,840
From now on, I'm just Hua Xiaochi.

684
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,760
I'm a businessman.

685
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,000
Hua Xiaotong

686
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,560
Separation.

687
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,160
The rent you paid for the shop

688
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
and the money you lent me

689
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
I'll pay you back today.

690
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,540
I've paid you back.

691
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,480
From now on,

692
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,600
will be my independent brand.

693
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,440
My partner, Gu Jin'er.

694
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,360
Hero, Zhang Gui Cai.

695
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,560
has nothing to do with the Chamber of Commerce.

696
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,560
You are right.

697
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,280
You will break off with the Chamber of Commerce eventually.

698
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Break up with me?

699
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,160
Yes.

700
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,040
I want to

701
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,440
with you forever.

702
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,580
When you signed the contract,

703
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,320
you didn't see the right I earned for you.

704
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
The contract says

705
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,840
the Chamber of Commerce has greater power

706
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,520
and the decision-making rights

707
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,000
in exchange for the support from the Chamber of Commerce

708
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,840
and the store.

709
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,000
If you break the contract,

710
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,860
you must pay 10,000 taels of gold.

711
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,840
or give your brand

712
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,970
to the Chamber of Commerce.

713
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,080
Xiao Zheng.

714
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,420
Separating hatred

715
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
Isn't this cheating?

716
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,360
It's written clearly in the contract.

717
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,560
because I was anxious to sign it.

718
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
I didn't look carefully.

719
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,160
It was an emergency.

720
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,440
Who would have the mood to read such a long contract?

721
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Separate hatred.

722
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,960
How could you use our trust

723
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,440
to do such a thing?

724
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,560
Xiao Zheng, I told you

725
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,010
that business is business.

726
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,800
The contract is written here.

727
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,880
You have to pay

728
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,880
or give up the brand.

729
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,000
This shop

730
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,040
is our hard work.

731
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,120
Didn't Jin'er do much for you these years?

732
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,540
Didn't the hero help you a lot?

733
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,160
Did Zhang Gui offend you?

734
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,080
Xiao Zheng.

735
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,520
We don't want this shop anymore.

736
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,760
Let's start over.

737
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,720
Yes.

738
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,800
We don't want it anymore.

739
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,840
We can open another shop.

740
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,960
Yes.

741
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Let's open another restaurant. I'll pay the principal.

742
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,340
Don't contact such people again.

743
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,160
Think carefully.

744
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,090
Once you hand over the shop,

745
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,840
all your efforts will be in vain.

746
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,280
Let's go.

747
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,410
What's going on?

748
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,000
Why are they all gone?

749
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
What should we do?

750
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,000
From now on,

751
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,960
the Chamber of Commerce

752
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,280
will be taken over by the Chamber of Commerce.

753
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,040
Brother Xu.

754
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
That day, I told you

755
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,840
there must be

756
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,720
between you and Xiao Zheng.

757
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,440
Now,

758
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,280
this misunderstanding should be resolved.

759
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,480
I misunderstood her.

760
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,760
Xiao Zheng
