1
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,210
Be careful. Be careful.

2
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,000
Understand?

3
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,700
Everyone says Lord Xu is the king of hell.

4
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,450
I didn't expect the king of hell to look like this.

5
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
Not everyone is like this.

6
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,880
Although Master Yi

7
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,639
I dare not agree with

8
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
I dare not agree with you.

9
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,500
But you are straightforward.

10
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,200
I'll be frank with you. I'll be frank with you. I'll be honest with you.

11
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
[Besides, I've never done this before.] [I've never done this before.]

12
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,329
All these years,

13
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,320
you've taken good care of Li.

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,240
I should get you a basin of water.

15
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,240
Everyone says Lord Xu is a good official.

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,800
Indeed.

17
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm dressed like a vegetarian.

18
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,079
No matter what,

19
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,040
step by step

20
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,840
step by step.

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,360
I became the leader of this magnificent chamber.

22
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
I told myself

23
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,680
never let anyone

24
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
again.

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
I'm down

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
and helpless.

27
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,400
Elder Yi.

28
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
Elder Yi. Master Yi.

29
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,560
Doctor! Call the doctor!

30
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,920
It's useless. She cut off her aorta.

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
Time is running out.

32
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Separate hatred.

33
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,160
I have something to tell you.

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
I have to tell you.

35
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
before I leave.

36
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,570
Prepare the best coffin

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,800
prepare the best coffin

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
and bury her well.

39
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Yes.

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,640
Go.

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,080
For your family and family,

42
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,920
for your family and family.

43
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,320
Because I think

44
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,960
we are the same kind of people.

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,079
From now on,

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,519
I'll be your master. I'll be your master. I'll be your servant. I'll be your servant. I'll be your servant.

47
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,720
If you follow Lord Wu,

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,580
It's much harder than now.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,880
than now.

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
As long as you think

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,490
if it's worth it.

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,240
don't look back.

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,120
The last thing I can do for you

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
is my death.

55
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Just say

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,320
when I committed suicide,

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,680
I found nothing.

58
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Lord Wu,

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,680
Let's go. Let's go.

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,780
Your Highness. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

61
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

62
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
I...

63
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
I can't...

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800
kiss you.

65
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,680
see you

66
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
Come on. Come on.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
reunite

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,320
together.

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,880
Master Yi.

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,320
Master Yi.

71
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,680
It's fate.

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,520
Li.

73
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,370
My lord, Xu Ziqi.

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,420
Xiao Zheng.

75
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,320
Sir.

76
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,240
Why is it all blood?

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,120
Elder Yi committed suicide.

78
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,080
and died in Ah Li's arms.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,880
Why did Master Yi commit suicide suddenly?

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
It's good that he committed suicide.

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,920
At least it's more decent to die.

82
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
with a full body.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I've sent someone

84
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,880
to bury her well.

85
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Xu Ziqi.

86
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
Let's go home now.

87
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I boiled hot water before going out.

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,680
Go back and take a hot bath.

89
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Yang Lin.

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,140
Take care of your lord.

91
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,080
Wipe the rain for your lord.

92
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,880
Where's the sedan chair?

93
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,680
The blood stains are all over my body.

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,240
I can't walk on the street.

95
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Husppy is carrying a sedan at the back.

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,820
He should be here soon.

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,500
Separating hatred

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,760
Xiao Zheng.

99
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
Separate hatred. Take care.

100
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
Go home now.

101
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Let's go home too.

102
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
Sir, the rain is getting heavier.

103
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,850
The sedan chair is here.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Let's go back.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,960
Why?

106
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,680
Why did everyone leave me?

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
Why?

108
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,560
My lord.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
What's wrong?

110
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,000
My lord.

111
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,299
Lord Fang, you're finally awake.

112
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,840
It has been burnt for a whole day.

113
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,919
I was so worried.

114
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Are you okay?

115
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,600
Get out.

116
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
No, sir.

117
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,080
You just woke up. You need someone to take care of you.

118
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,800
Get out.

119
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,400
This...

120
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,320
Yes.

121
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
The Chamber of Commerce has a ledger.

122
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,480
Don't give it to Lord Wu.

123
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,280
This man is heartless and not trustworthy.

124
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,560
You must find the ledger and protect yourself.

125
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,860
Do you understand?

126
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,800
Why am I still

127
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,960
I still want you so much?

128
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,180
Hua Xiao Zheng.

129
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
I don't want to

130
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't want to lose you.

131
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,680
Everyone is using me.

132
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,380
Xu Ziqi used me to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

133
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,200
The four elders used me to work for them.

134
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
Others used me

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
for their money.

136
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,480
Except you,

137
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
except you

138
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
only you

139
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,280
really loved me.

140
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
Only you.

141
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,140
I will never...

142
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,440
I will never let you go.

143
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,160
I'll make sure you come back to me.

144
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
I will.

145
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,600
I will make you come back to me.

146
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,960
I will.

147
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,080
My lord, are you okay?

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,480
My lord, don't scare me.

149
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,040
My lord.

150
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,440
Are you okay?

151
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
Rest early today.

152
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,680
I have something important to do tomorrow.

153
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,480
What is it?

154
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,080
Greetings, Lord Wu.

155
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
I’m incompetent.

156
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,400
I heard nothing.

157
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,080
Master Ii, how dare you say that in front of me?

158
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,960
Master Yi...

159
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,720
I know everything.

160
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
It’s not your fault.

161
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,560
Master Yi has a temper.

162
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
This way

163
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,840
is something she can do.

164
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,200
I failed.

165
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,060
The first thing you asked me to do.

166
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,160
Today, I came to ask for your forgiveness.

167
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
I have no face to see you anymore.

168
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
From now on,

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,140
say goodbye to you.

170
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,920
My lord.

171
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,040
I think

172
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
Looks like he really apologized to you and left.

173
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,200
He left firmly.

174
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
Ask someone to call him back.

175
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,960
He's a good boy.

176
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,960
You have to train him well.

177
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,440
Yes.

178
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
We'll continue with the product.

179
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,800
The main business content is still cosmetics.

180
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
We still have no store for delivery.

181
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,960
But now we need to solve two problems.

182
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,600
First, our sales are much better than expected.

183
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,800
So we need to purchase more flower fields

184
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
and more farmers.

185
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,080
There are many people in Chang'an who don't have fixed income

186
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,200
but people with labor ability.

187
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,600
So my suggestion is to hire them to farm.

188
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,080
to earn more money

189
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,280
make more money to improve their lives.

190
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Secondly, I suggest

191
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,320
I suggest

192
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,160
to train more beauty knowledge.

193
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Men train beauty makeup.

194
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,450
Will anyone listen to them?

195
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,320
For some reason,

196
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,320
I always treat you as my sister.

197
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,920
Don't forget the opposite sex.

198
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,680
It's more convincing

199
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,680
might be more convincing than women.

200
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
Heroes are the best examples.

201
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,160
And

202
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
we have to try something different.

203
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,080
We not only want to make women's makeup,

204
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,960
We also need to develop men's cosmetics.

205
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,600
How can men make up?

206
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,560
Isn't this a fantasy?

207
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,520
Why do I always forget that you're a man?

208
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,720
Baby say more

209
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
I almost died on the spot.

210
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,860
Come to think of it,

211
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Zheng,

212
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,840
I didn't expect you

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
about beauty.

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,080
The hero and I thought

215
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,940
and won't think about it anymore.

216
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,810
After all, the Chamber of Commerce won't threaten you anymore.

217
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,160
Anyway,

218
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,080
I really like making up.

219
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,440
and that's what I think is right.

220
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,200
There are so many mistakes in the world.

221
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,080
It's not easy to meet the right one.

222
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,400
Shouldn't you stick to what's worth it?

223
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,220
By the way, Jin'er,

224
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,160
Coach Xue gave you so much money.

225
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,960
You're already a rich woman.

226
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,980
Are you sure you want to start a business with me?

227
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
You want me to take care of my family?

228
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
That's impossible.

229
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,920
I know what kind of woman I am.

230
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,040
I just like wandering in the crowd.

231
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
I like to dress up every day.

232
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
To put it bluntly,

233
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,900
she just likes to show off.

234
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,960
No matter how popular the Lucky Carp Alliance is,

235
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,920
they will only call me Madam.

236
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,320
I still want others to call me Gu Jin'er.

237
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,960
Beauty makes me happy

238
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,280
I feel different.

239
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,359
I was born for beauty.

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,880
Why not?

241
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,240
Okay, it's a deal.

242
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Let's work hard to do our business.

243
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,720
Let’s do it.

244
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,490
Welcome the new chief of the Chamber of Commerce.

245
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,160
My lord.

246
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
Lord Wu has given you ten days

247
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,600
in ten days.

248
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,000
and connect the connections of the four Elders.

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,840
This is

250
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,120
these days.

251
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,360
these days.

252
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,740
Please have a look.

253
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Zheng.

254
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,440
The dish we just made

255
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Look. The ingredients are all the same.

256
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
There's a spoonful of sugar.

257
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
That's totally different

258
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,720
Did you add sugar?

259
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,480
Yes, I think it's so fresh.

260
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:25,960
Right?

261
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,970
I find that I have nothing to do.

262
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,200
I cook a few dishes at home.

263
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,880
It's really fulfilling.

264
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Let me tell you.

265
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,200
I'll take you to buy groceries tomorrow.

266
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
There are many things to learn and learn about grocery shopping.

267
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,280
Really?

268
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,840
Really?

269
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,120
I'll ask them to prepare two pizzas.

270
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,680
They look more professional when shopping.

271
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,440
Yes, it's convenient

272
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,640
It's big

273
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,820
and a lot of dishes.

274
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,420
It's not easy to get bored.

275
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,600
Okay, this is good.

276
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,840
Sure.

277
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,680
Why do you look so pale?

278
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,040
How about I make you some gelatin?

279
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,200
Xu Ziqi.

280
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,840
It's fine if you like cooking.

281
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,200
Why did you drag Jang Gui-jae along?

282
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,360
You don’t have much work to do.

283
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,880
Zhang Gui Cai's men

284
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,810
has thousands of people to manage.

285
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,220
It doesn't matter.

286
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,200
Family affairs and state affairs

287
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,680
Jin'er comes first.

288
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,240
Jin'er.

289
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,040
How about I warm a bowl for you?

290
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Red date soup?

291
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
I just made you osmanthus minced fish.

292
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,960
It's delicious.

293
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Don't you like it the most?

294
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,160
Try it. I learned it from him.

295
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,960
Have a taste.

296
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,000
Is it good?

297
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,680
Wait.

298
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,200
Can you feel it?

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,600
Why is there a chill in this weather?

300
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,440
Cold?

301
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,680
It's not cold wind.

302
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,080
It's the lonely wind.

303
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Lonely.

304
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,440
Do you feel it?

305
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,280
In this cold wind,

306
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,240
in the cold.

307
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,440
The cold comes from that door.

308
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Separate hatred.

309
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,880
Li!

310
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,010
Separating hatred.

311
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,850
Why are you here?

312
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,680
Xiao Zheng.

313
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
I remember when you first entered the mansion,

314
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
when you first entered the mansion.

315
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,680
I didn’t take it to heart.

316
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
The four elders of the Chamber of Commerce

317
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,760
I was threatened by them.

318
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,020
to force you to hand over the drawing.

319
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,360
I was wrong.

320
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,400
I came here today

321
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,480
to invite you

322
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,160
to join the Chamber of Commerce again.

323
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,620
and do business together.

324
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,700
Xiao Zheng.

325
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,880
The next step

326
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,960
my next move to the picture.

327
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
I know it's important.

328
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
You can take a look at this first.

329
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,400
The store will give a detailed statement.

330
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,930
If you think it's possible,

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,880
we can discuss the rest.

332
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Separate hatred.

333
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,160
I don't know

334
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,760
I don't know how to answer you.

335
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,920
Indeed, we're going to keep doing makeup.

336
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,040
We also have our plan.

337
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,490
We don’t have to cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce.

338
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,760
The Chamber of Commerce is no longer the previous Chamber of Commerce.

339
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,040
Now the Chamber of Commerce

340
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,480
in the Chamber of Commerce.

341
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,920
The Chamber of Commerce has been doing business of rich people.

342
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,240
Our small business

343
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,580
are doing business of the people.

344
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,620
We have different customers.

345
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,680
Why do we have to get involved?

346
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,200
I want to do something good

347
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,240
for the people.

348
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,680
I need good things

349
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,560
to win the people's support.

350
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,360
Release hatred

351
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,020
Xiao Zheng.

352
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I know you’re worried.

353
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,280
But please go back

354
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,000
and read the store in detail.

355
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
When you're done,

356
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,360
if you still think we can't work together,

357
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,100
I won't force you anymore.

358
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
What do you think?

359
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,000
Is the Chamber of Commerce reliable?

360
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,360
How can this house turn against each other faster than turning the table?

361
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,680
Exactly.

362
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,730
Let's not talk about the store.

363
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,610
the people's hearts

364
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,120
How can you force it?

365
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,880
It's impossible to win people's support

366
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,200
for the people.

367
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,840
People are not fools.

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,880
It's okay.

369
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,840
Although the Chamber of Commerce has changed,

370
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,520
but the person behind it hasn't changed.

371
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,200
I know.

372
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,360
Xu Ziqi.

373
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,170
What are you looking at?

374
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,620
Before the three Elders died,

375
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
left these strange symbols

376
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,280
in the prison.

377
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
The guards wrote them down.

378
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,240
Now I want to try my best

379
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,440
to find the whereabouts of the ledger.

380
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,960
Let me see.

381
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,010
I don't understand.

382
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
It's just a ledger.

383
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,400
Why is Her Majesty making a fuss?

384
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,520
After so many years,

385
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,000
and so many palace spies.

386
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
It's just a note.

387
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,200
Zheng.

388
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,200
Do you know

389
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
in the ledger?

390
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
The merchants

391
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,200
not only has he entered the people's daily life,

392
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
but also trade with foreign countries.

393
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,960
The amount of money they have

394
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,960
are recorded clearly.

395
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
This ledger

396
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,960
not only recorded

397
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,040
what they do every year.

398
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,400
and who they had money dealings with.

399
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,960
and who is in the light,

400
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,120
and what is in the dark.

401
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
It also recorded

402
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,400
how much money they earned every year

403
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,480
to the national treasury?

404
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,690
The Chamber of Commerce

405
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,540
to the national treasury at least 10,000 taels of gold every year.

406
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Where did the tens of thousands of taels of gold go?

407
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,460
Thousands of taels

408
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
How many armors and weapons

409
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,740
How many armors and weapons can we exchange?

410
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,120
How much relief grains can we give to the people?

411
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,400
The more greedy the Chamber of Commerce is,

412
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,120
the life of the people will be harder.

413
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,880
What I just said

414
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,220
is just a conservative estimate.

415
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,120
The real amount

416
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,760
is more than three times the amount.

417
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
How dare the Chamber of Commerce do that?

418
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,960
The four elders

419
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,920
are just scapegoats.

420
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,720
The mastermind

421
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,520
is the one who stole the big head.

422
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,540
The person behind this

423
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,600
must know

424
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,530
the ledger with detailed records.

425
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,000
So he can't wait to find the right time

426
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,330
to kill the four Elders.

427
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,400
And the spy department has made statistics.

428
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,720
The next step

429
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,960
is to invade

430
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,160
the daily necessities of the people.

431
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,240
Once they know

432
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,880
the daily necessities

433
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,930
They're oppressing me.

434
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,090
and raise the price,

435
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,040
the lives of the people will be miserable.

436
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,360
I remember.

437
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,160
When we were in Peace,

438
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,900
you told me rice was getting more expensive.

439
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,680
Yes.

440
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,440
If the people can't even afford rice,

441
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,680
there will be a lot of resentment.

442
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,240
The people will be resentful.

443
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,960
Tang

444
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,520
will be over.

445
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,680
So all these years,

446
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,520
for so many years.

447
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,600
Yes.

448
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,960
But now,

449
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,680
the four elders are gone.

450
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,720
It will be harder to investigate.

451
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,360
Do you think Lord Wu knows about the ledger?

452
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,720
I don't think he knows.

453
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,240
Do you know that?

454
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,000
Don't even think about it.

455
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,440
I...

456
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,980
Just lock yourself up and don't go anywhere.

457
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,040
Try it. I...

458
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,680
What?

459
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,240
Try it.

460
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,040
Nonsense.

461
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:03,680
Try it.

462
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,480
There's no room for discussion.

463
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,660
Why is it getting heavier?

464
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,160
You feed me fat.

465
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,730
Let's get down to business.

466
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Do you remember

467
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,880
I expelled you

468
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
I kicked you out of Chang'an?

469
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,640
How dare you mention that?

470
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400
I see.

471
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,200
So...

472
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
"I'm afraid of you." "I'm afraid of you." "I'm afraid of you." "I'm afraid of you."

473
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,840
I was afraid

474
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,480
you would get involved in the Chamber of Commerce

475
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,520
and got involved in the Chamber of Commerce.

476
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,160
Although the plan failed,

477
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,680
but luckily,

478
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,960
has a bottom line.

479
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,920
That's why

480
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,200
with the Chamber of Commerce.

481
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,900
But you have to know

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,960
At that time,

483
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,840
I risked

484
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,760
to see you

485
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,530
to send you out of Chang'an.

486
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,440
How could I

487
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,920
put you in danger?

488
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
So,

489
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,280
you fell in love with me at that time, right?

490
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,100
Why did you skip the topic?

491
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm just asking.

492
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,720
I want to know

493
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,600
when you fell in love with me.

494
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,210
Let's get down to business.

495
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,200
At that time,

496
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,900
the four elders were there. It's easy to say.

497
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,880
Now the hatred is gone.

498
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,600
We don't know

499
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,960
about the Chamber of Commerce.

500
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,680
what you should say,

501
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,520
and what you should do.

502
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,280
It's hard to say.

503
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,920
So you can't risk your life.

504
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,760
You can’t get involved

505
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
in the mess of the Chamber of Commerce.

506
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,840
You must have liked me back then.

507
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,120
I didn't like you back then.

508
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,200
You...

509
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,410
I fell in love with you at that time.

510
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Now,

511
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,680
I love you more now.

512
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm a man.

513
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,680
You're my woman now.

514
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,160
How can I watch the woman I love

515
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,240
to risk my life?

516
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,240
I can’t let you go back to the Chamber of Commerce.

517
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
back to the dangerous place.

518
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,760
I'm your little baby, right?

519
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,920
Yes.

520
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Will you give up your life

521
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,720
for me, right?

522
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,000
It's my duty.

523
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,280
You told me before

524
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
you would sacrifice your life

525
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880
for the people of Tang?

526
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm just like them.

527
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,440
You saved me today.

528
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,360
the people may suffer

529
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,040
in deep water.

530
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,720
But if I let you join the Chamber of Commerce,

531
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,200
I might let them

532
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,520
as soon as possible.

533
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,960
Xu Ziqi.

534
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,280
Xiaoai is also love.

535
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,360
Love is also love.

536
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,080
You have to sacrifice your love for Xiaoai.

537
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
I want to do something

538
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,120
like you.

539
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,160
What's wrong?

540
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,840
Oh my god.

541
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,040
I said such philosophy.

542
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,680
At that moment,

543
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,000
at that moment.

544
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,640
Yes, you're wise.

545
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,880
I have a heart

546
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,480
I want everyone to live a good life.

547
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,880
Let me try.

548
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,040
Don't worry. I'm much better than before.

549
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,280
Besides, we can

550
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,810
we can discuss it directly.

551
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,720
Nothing will happen.

552
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,160
I feel

553
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm useless.

554
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,440
Yae!

555
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,240
and my ancestors are great heroes.

556
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,440
And now,

557
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,920
I can't even find

558
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
such a small ledger.

559
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,280
You're also good at war.

560
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
You are also

561
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,520
in the battlefield.

562
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,160
Besides, the ledger is also brain work.

563
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,480
So many people hid such a small thing.

564
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,890
How can you compete with them with your brain?

565
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,720
Why do I feel like you're calling me stupid?

566
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
I heard that

567
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,680
people are stupid when they are in love.

568
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
It's not your fault.

569
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,720
It's my fault. I'm too charming.

570
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,720
Okay.

571
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,680
This is where you try your best

572
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,880
to protect.

573
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,480
I want to protect our home with you.

574
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,640
Let's protect our home together.

575
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,200
And

576
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
Let me protect you.

577
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,720
Personal merchant.

578
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,200
Alliance Manual.

579
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,000
The people of Chang'an

580
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
and free labor.

581
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,600
If the individual who wants to do business

582
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,520
and every free worker at home,

583
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,880
regardless of gender

584
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,280
regardless of knowledge,

585
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,480
we can make money to support our family.

586
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,940
It will attract many people to participate.

587
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,200
This kind of business

588
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,720
a betrayal.

589
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,480
Yes.

590
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,400
It's a betrayal.

591
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Our goal

592
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,520
is to let every laborer have autonomy

593
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,960
to get out of the control of the Chamber of Commerce.

594
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,600
Huacai Hall is open.

595
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,060

596
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,480

Okay.

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,440
You go to the west market.

600
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,000

We just opened today.

606
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:56,760
Hello.

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,520

612
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,360
officially open.

613
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,040
Okay.

614
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
Let's go. Let's go.

615
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,440
Congratulations.

616
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,880
Congratulations.

617
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,920
Master Hwa Chae

618
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,440
for commoners

619
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,440
and new services.

620
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,160
Each frame

621
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,440
to provide customized beauty service

622
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,640
for you and your friends.

623
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,020
Our frame owners not only deliver goods,

624
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,240
but also teach you how to make up.

625
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,680
Huacai Hall, gorgeous.

626
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,160
Brilliant!

627
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Let's be the most beautiful boy in Tang together.

628
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,040
Okay.

629
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,640
Here you go.

630
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,920
Here.

631
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,440
Okay.

632
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,680
Huacai Hall

633
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,920
will give each of you a frame.

634
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,160
This frame is a sign

635
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,600
for yourself and your family.

636
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,680
It's also a symbol of your self-improvement.

637
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,199
From now on, we're all family members.

638
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,199
Okay.

639
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,840
Look, the number of stars on this frame

640
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
is decided by

641
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,600
by every customer.

642
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,580
You will get one star for every 10 good comments.

643
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,280
One star is iron frame.

644
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,840
Two are silver frames.

645
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Push it like this.

646
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,120
Five are the best.

647
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,520
We have a golden frame at home.

648
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,239
Gold frame.

649
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,880
Let's start the free training for makeup.

650
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,239
Okay.

651
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,360
Our frame training is free.

652
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,960
There are two sections in total.

653
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,440
First, the booklet in front of you

654
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
requires everyone to recite it.

655
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,530
Every word is right.

656
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,600
Step two, get familiar with every makeup technique.

657
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,960
Let's start now.

658
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,000
A glimpse of lipstick between Huacai Hall's lips.

659
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,440
The black belt of Huacai Hall is here.

660
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,280
A glimpse of lipstick on the lips of Huacai Hall

661
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,640
A glimpse of lip of Huacai Hall has arrived.

662
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,440
The goods are here.

663
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,780
Your goods.

664
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,960
Thank you.

665
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,400
Thank you.

666
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,240
The most important thing about base makeup is to be gentle.

667
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,520
Don't rub it casually.

668
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,160
The best way

669
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,600
The best way is to dip it gently with pads

670
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,360
and shake it slightly.

671
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,040
Shake the extra powder.

672
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,240
It’s more evenly on the face.

673
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,120
Please show us

674
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,560
The first chapter.

675
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,440
The second step to press the pink.

676
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,120
Please.

677
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,080
The most important thing about base makeup is to be gentle.

678
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,920
Don't rub it casually.

679
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,960
It's so easy to make up.

680
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,600
The better way

681
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,960
is to use pads

682
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,520
Dip it gently

683
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Then shake slightly.

684
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,520
Shake the extra powder

685
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,560
Then press it gently on the face.

686
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,440
It's more evenly on the face.

687
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,540
Ladies and gentlemen,

688
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,520
If you have any questions,

689
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
please check the list.

690
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,220
Please say it out loud.

691
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
Me.

692
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,480
show you again.

693
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,080
You can choose whether to speed up or slow down.

694
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,440
If there's no problem,

695
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,600
let's move on

696
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
the next chapter.

697
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,560
Chapter Two Shadow.

698
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Everyone has different taste.

699
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,640
The lines on the other side are different.

700
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,720
You're a man.

701
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,760
how can you put on makeup?

702
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
That's a good question.

703
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
Our country's morale has swallowed everything.

704
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,650
is magnanimous.

705
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,480
Men are like women.

706
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,280
have the right to pursue beauty.

707
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,140
Similarly,

708
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,960
women can learn riding and archery like men.

709
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,000
Everyone is equal in men's clothes.

710
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,880
Everyone is like a star

711
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,320
like the stars.

712
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,720
This is the purpose of our Huacai Hall.

713
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,360
At last, everyone who makes money

714
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,280
who makes money by fair means

715
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,600
are all great people.

716
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,120
Am I right?

717
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,840
Yes.

718
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Okay. Let's go. Okay.

719
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,640
Okay.

720
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
I'm incompetent.

721
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,440
I persuaded Hua Xiaotong many times.

722
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,170
she still decided to establish her own business.

723
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,640
Lord Fang, other merchants in Chang'an

724
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,120
have been obedient

725
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,120
the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

726
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,440
Only Hua Xiaochi

727
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,330
doesn't even give me this face.

728
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,560
He even made

729
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,760
Every family needs a frame.

730
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,760
Everyone can make money.

731
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,960
I won't cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce anymore.

732
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,020
If the whole market goes on like this,

733
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,360
there will be no rules.

734
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,560
It's inappropriate.

735
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,120
I understand.

736
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,940
Don't stand there.

737
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,800
Come and eat with me.

738
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,600
One coin.

739
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,880
Two cents.

740
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,520
It's a virtual money. It's not worth it.

741
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
is no match for

742
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,480
It's a sense of achievement.

743
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,360
The texture and texture

744
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,960
This weight...

745
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,170
Hua Xiaochi.

746
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,040
Do you think I'm air?

747
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,160
You only know how to make money.

748
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,720
Do you still care about me?

749
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,960
Zheng.

750
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,400
Baby.

751
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,440
Aren't we together every day?

752
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,520
Not at all.

753
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Smell it. It smells good.

754
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,880
Boss.

755
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,040
Coming

756
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,760
Show me this

757
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
Sir, wrap this up for me.

758
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,480
Okay take a look at this

759
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,000
Okay.

760
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,080
Zheng

761
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,160
I think this is pretty.

762
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,320
You have good taste.

763
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,520
We want everyone

764
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,800
in the garment of Huacai Hall

765
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,320
in Huacai Hall

766
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,080
who can tolerate

767
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,880
Let's go! Let's go!

768
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,600
Wings.

769
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,640
When did you come?

770
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,720
Two hours ago.

771
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,360
two hours ago.

772
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,960
Did you? Yes.

773
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,800
Yes.

774
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,560
Baby.

775
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,960
I found a place

776
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,400
I can see the moon.

777
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,920
From the philosophy of life

778
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
from philosophy of life.

779
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,400
From romance to daily necessities

780
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,400
But I don't know any of these.

781
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,240
I'm developing a new product.

782
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,480
How about

783
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,560
talk to Yang Debiao?

784
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm really going.

785
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,920
Okay, go.

786
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
I'm really going.

787
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
Take care.

788
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,040
In general,

789
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,040
you've been

790
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,920
you've been making money.

791
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,740
You don't care about me at all.

792
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,080
You are greedy for money.

793
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,210
You're ungrateful.

794
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,040
Yes.

795
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,320
Anyway, what you did is wrong.

796
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,000
Look at Jin'er.

797
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,600
No matter how tired she is,

798
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
When you get home,

799
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,360
when you get home.

800
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,760
You're going too far.

801
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,840
You are not qualified to eat fruit.

802
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,460
Jin'er, eat it.

803
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,120
Baby.

804
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,920
I'm sorry, baby.

805
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,520
I didn't mean to ignore you.

806
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,440
I'm sorry.

807
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,320
I'm so wronged.

808
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,920
It's okay.

809
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,560
My lord, I'm full.

810
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,900
Serve the food.

811
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,240
Eat more. Don't waste it.

812
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,660
These are good ingredients that can't be traded with gold and silver.

813
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,440
Eat more.

814
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,960
Don't waste it.

815
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,440
You doll.

816
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,480
be so obedient?

817
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,600
Whatever I say,

818
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,720
whatever I say.

819
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,520
I told you

820
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,360
I can have this honor

821
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,090
because of Lord Wu's kindness.

822
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,770
If you have any request,

823
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,520
I will never disobey.

824
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,200
You may leave.

825
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,760
My Lord, you are back.

826
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,240
My lord, what's wrong?

827
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,640
What's wrong?

828
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,120
Are you okay?

829
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,400
I promise you.

830
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,360
I won't let you be alone anymore.

831
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,400
Empty Lady?

832
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,800
Empty lady.

833
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,600
I don't know why

834
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,760
I always say weird things

835
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,440
to Xu Ziqi.

836
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,560
Change it.

837
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,600
I won't let you be alone anymore.

838
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,840
Empty room?

839
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,560
Alone.

840
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,800
The bed.

841
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,400
That's what it means.

842
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,640
Baby, you know me.

843
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,840
I'm really wrong. I swear.

844
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,960
I will never do this again.

845
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,360
Really?

846
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,600
I should buy something to make it up to you.

847
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,120
Tell me what you want.

848
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,420
I'll buy it for you.

849
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,040
I want to buy it.

850
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,520
It's nothing.

851
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,360
Just tell me what you want.

852
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,560
I'll buy it for you.

853
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,720
Li's Iron Store has a new meteor hammer.

854
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,240
It's handmade.

855
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,600
It's very sharp.

856
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,720
I like it.

857
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,240
Buy it.

858
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,800
And my nine-section whip is worn out.

859
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,120
It's time to change.

860
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:32,850
Change them.

861
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,920
And my hidden weapons

862
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
are always used by my brothers.

863
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,130
I want to buy a few hundred more.

864
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:40,640
OK.

865
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,760
You're so nice.

866
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,800
Brother Xu,

867
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,120
I don't understand how you look.

868
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,240
What's wrong?

869
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,440
I can embrace the people of Tang.

870
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,920
I don't deserve a hug.

871
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,960
A match.

872
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,080
Let's ignore them.
