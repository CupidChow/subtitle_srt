1
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,360
Take care.

2
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,720
Xiao.

3
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,860
Let's go. Let's go.

4
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,800
Let's go.

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
Let's continue to eat.

6
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,090
Let me heat it up for you.

7
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
This is so similar.

8
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Amazing.

9
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,020
Let's eat together

10
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
Did you wash your pot?

11
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Yes.

12
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,579
What are you doing?

13
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,960
What are you doing?

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
I think

15
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,360
you and Yang Debiao are quite close.

16
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
You don't like me enough.

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll cook myself.

18
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
It's so big.

19
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,600
I can't cook it in one pot.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,640
This painting is very thoughtful.

21
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,960
Keep it in mind.

22
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,920
It's so vivid.

23
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,970
How many times do you have to see him

24
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,120
to make it so vivid?

25
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Not many times.

26
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Of course not as many times as we met.

27
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
Then draw me.

28
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Let me see.

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,079
Then draw me too.

30
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
You've seen me

31
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,840
than Miss Yang.

32
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,800
Okay.

33
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,760
Let's draw one for each other.

34
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,290
Let's go.

35
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
Let's go. Let's go.

36
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,320
Let me see.

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
What if

38
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,120
like mine,

39
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,320
is real.

40
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,680
to judge whether a woman likes me or not.

41
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,120
I think you hate me.

42
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
Now that I think about it,

43
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
I think you hate me too.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,680
So,

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,240
You're wrong.

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
Let's say I'm talking nonsense.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
But

48
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,000
you can't have too much contact with Yang Debiao.

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm dead.

50
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,250
How can I have so much contact with her?

51
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
That makes sense.

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
From now on,

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,760
you'll be my little baby.

54
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,520
I'll lock you up in your room every day.

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,680
You can't go anywhere.

56
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,240
I won't go anywhere even if you don't lock me up.

57
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,200
So this house

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,600
will be your whole world.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,680
That's my little treasure.

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,640
I...

61
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,680
Are you flirting or not?

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,240
Yes.

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
Do you like it?

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll do it every day.

65
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,700
Who would have thought

66
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,440
the best one for a girl

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,200
is the best general of Tang, Xu Ziqi.

68
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,120
I...

69
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Baby, do the dishes at home.

70
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,080
I need to focus on my career.

71
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,320
To put it bluntly, the contract has been signed.

72
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,120
we'll accept the compensation.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,080
I just hope that after you take over the painting,

74
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,640
don't raise the price and don't make fake goods.

75
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
This brand is for you.

76
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,560
That's the formula.

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,640
As long as you follow the recipe,

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,930
you can make a lot of money without raising the price.

79
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,980
You came all the way here today

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,200
to tell me this?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,260
Actually, I'm here to say goodbye to you.

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,770
When Xu Ziqi is gone,

83
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,640
you will leave Chang'an.

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,530
I won't leave Chang'an.

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,560
But from now on,

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
we don't need to contact each other anymore.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Why?

88
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Separate hatred?

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
Why did Jin'er become

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,640
for three years?

91
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,360
How can you keep

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,560
the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce?

93
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,760
I guess so.

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
But I never thought

95
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,580
your intelligence and calculation would be used on me.

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
But after the incident,

97
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,680
I can't trust you anymore.

98
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,200
Since we're on different sides,

99
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,530
let's part ways nicely.

100
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
Different stations.

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,200
Zheng,

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,880
Are you still going to go against the Chamber of Commerce?

103
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
Fight?

104
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,130
Not against each other.

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,440
There are many different ways

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,640
in this world.

107
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,080
But we chose different

108
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,240
We can try to live together.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
It just takes a long process.

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,440
Zheng.

111
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,760
Xu Ziqi is gone.

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,520
We can start over.

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,560
But I don't like you.

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,000
You did.

115
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
You said you liked it.

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,090
At that time, I couldn't see my heart clearly.

117
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,120
I thought I liked you.

118
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,880
Actually not.

119
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,820
The person I like has always been Xu Ziqi.

120
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,760
Xu Ziqi is gone.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,400
and will never come back.

122
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,220
You still have to like him.

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll always like him.

124
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,200
Are you crazy?

125
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,080
It's meaningless

126
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
and not worth it.

127
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,040
This is the biggest difference between us.

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,960
You need to calculate everything.

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,400
But there are not so many calculations in love.

130
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,320
I'm here to say goodbye.

131
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,440
I don't want to argue with you.

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm leaving.

133
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,320
You want to leave the Chamber of Commerce?

134
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
to leave the Chamber of Commerce.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,679
But we have to settle the penalty.

136
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Contract damage?

137
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,720
I thought you were just throwing a tantrum

138
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,360
and your little dispute.

139
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,320
So I didn't argue with you

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Now that you're leaving,

141
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,050
I have to tell you the condition of leaving the Chamber of Commerce.

142
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
500 taels of silver.

143
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,840
Are you sure? Yes.

144
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,480
I can ask Yang Lin

145
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,160
to show you the details.

146
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,680
It's true.

147
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,960
It has been written

148
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,240
on the rules of the Chamber of Commerce.

149
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
But you are the first one

150
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,560
you're the first one to leave the Chamber of Commerce.

151
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,440
You must pay it back in a month after you leave the Chamber of Commerce.

152
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,320
Otherwise, we'll go to the court for a lawsuit.

153
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,680
OK. OK.

154
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,800
One month.

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Here.

156
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,400
My lord, love

157
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,920
shouldn't be forced.

158
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Moreover,

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,320
the Chamber of Commerce is in a mess.

160
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,040
Why don't we just let go of Ms. Zheng?

161
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,920
I can't.

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,080
The brand new beauty product

163
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,320
is about to be launched.

164
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,200
It's still a traditional recipe.

165
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Beautiful color

166
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,160
Show the most beautiful you

167
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,960
Okay.

168
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,400
The Carp League personally escorts it.

169
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
full carriages.

170
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,480
to meet all the ladies' needs.

171
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,200
Yes, we can give you

172
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,440
we can give you.

173
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
your sisters.

174
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,280
Ask your auntie

175
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,730
and order together.

176
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,960
Pave the way for your beauty.

177
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,480
Nice.

178
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,680
I didn't expect it to be so popular.

179
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,080
Yeah.

180
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,840
So many people.

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,800
Of course.

182
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,380
Who came up with this idea?

183
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Zheng is amazing.

184
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,920
Let's celebrate.

185
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,020
Let's have a drink.

186
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
I didn't expect it to be so successful.

187
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,200
Cheers!

188
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Cheers! Cheers!

189
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,080
Cheers!

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,200
So handsome!

191
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,940
You are so good at picking.

192
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,480
You're so pretty.

193
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
Of course.

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,080
Look who picked them.

195
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,840
And I picked them out

196
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,200
from the Lucky Carp Alliance.

197
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,680
Although Second Master is usually fierce,

198
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,560
to decorate his beard and hairstyle.

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,840
Put on the uniform.

200
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,200
Isn’t it so manly?

201
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,400
I didn’t expect you to be so charming.

202
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,560
They used to like handsome guys like me.

203
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,320
Now,

204
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,280
like a big man like Second Master.

205
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,200
Exactly.

206
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
When can I

207
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
become like them?

208
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
It's not about training.

209
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,160
It's about food.

210
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Eat.

211
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,320
Brother.

212
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,370
Brother.

213
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,720
Miss Xiao.

214
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
All the leaflets

215
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,680
all the leaflets.

216
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
I didn't expect

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,840
the trick of ex-sister-in-law

218
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,440
is awesome.

219
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Am I right?

220
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Roar.

221
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Look at this.

222
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,560
What are you wearing?

223
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,440
Go get changed.

224
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,480
Brother.

225
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Don't you think

226
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm handsome?

227
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,040
Look.

228
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
It's really good.

229
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,160
Take it off.

230
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,920
Get changed.

231
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,440
Go.

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,610
Hurry up.

233
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,560
What do you usually

234
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
usually eat?

235
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,480
You know

236
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,960
I love eggs.

237
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,380
Eight for one meal.

238
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,840
Cook eggs.

239
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,560
Is it good?

240
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Yes.

241
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,480
It smells so good.

242
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,610
I'll take you there.

243
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
Lord Wu found out.

244
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,320
Xu Ziqi

245
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,840
was sent by the court to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

246
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,970
The Imperial Agent?

247
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,820
Not only is he not dead,

248
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
he also hides in the inner courtyard

249
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,860
and spend the night with Hua Xiaochi.

250
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
He's really capable.

251
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,080
How can the government be against our Chamber of Commerce?

252
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,040
All these years,

253
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,080
spies have been attacking our Chamber of Commerce.

254
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,040
No matter how much they smash,

255
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,640
no matter how hard I smash it.

256
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
Master Yi.

257
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,960
What do you mean?

258
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,240
As long as you investigate the spy of our Chamber of Commerce,

259
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
no one can go back alive.

260
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,920
Since Xu Ziqi has faked his death,

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,400
let him die.

262
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm so happy.

263
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,440
Here.

264
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,880
Come on.

265
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,080
Happy.

266
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,320
Yang Lin.

267
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Don't you think something is wrong?

268
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Xu Ziqi is dead.

269
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,800
Why is Hua Xiaochi so happy?

270
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,800
She's always optimistic.

271
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
Forcing a smile

272
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,960
It's reasonable to try to survive.

273
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,440
The more I think about it, the more I feel something is wrong.

274
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,680
Who is Xu Ziqi?

275
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,740
How could he die in an accident so easily?

276
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,460
You must be worrying too much.

277
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm afraid he can't accept

278
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,080
that Lord Xu has passed away.

279
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
I can accept it.

280
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
I just think

281
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,800
he's not dead at all.

282
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,920
What?

283
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,680
I just don't like it.

284
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,840
You don't want to be with me anymore.

285
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm tired of it.

286
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,720
Talk nicely.

287
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,560
I'll talk nicely.

288
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,700
You weren't like this before.

289
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,280
I think you've changed.

290
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,740
You don't love me anymore.

291
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,920
Look.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,900
These are the information of all cavalries.

293
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,200
It's an application document

294
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,160
who pressed the fingerprint.

295
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,840
The cavalries and I are innocent.

296
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,080
Mr. Zhang,

297
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,680
Is he here to discuss the candidate with you?

298
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,480
I was on the beam.

299
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,720
I heard it clearly.

300
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,460
You can choose anyone.

301
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
It's fine to look at his face.

302
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,800
What are you doing?

303
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm on the beam.

304
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,210
Did you touch her in front of me?

305
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,680
How would I know if I didn't touch him?

306
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,010
if his muscles are good.

307
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,320
Didn't Zhang Gui say he'll touch it for you?

308
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,560
Then why did you touch it yourself?

309
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,490
You're almost thrown into the pot.

310
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,400
You know.

311
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,440
That's my hobby.

312
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Well,

313
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,580
If you want to touch it,

314
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,480
You...

315
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,720
Touch me.

316
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
Not bad.

317
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,160
Well...

318
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,160
My abs are good.

319
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
It's really good.

320
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,920
Well,

321
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,680
Is my muscle better or their muscle?

322
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,280
It must be my baby.

323
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,560
is the best, right?

324
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
Yes.

325
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
You're the best.

326
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,920
Don't touch me again.

327
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,200
Look.

328
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Is there

329
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Are they setting off fireworks?

330
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,960
Bad news.

331
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
Let's go. Put it on.

332
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,090
Let's go.

333
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,680
Our home.

334
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,560
Let's go in.

335
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,090
It must be safe here.

336
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Right here.

337
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,160
Zheng.

338
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,960
Wait here.

339
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
I'll light the fire first.

340
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Okay.

341
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,720
This is

342
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
is my family's grave.

343
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,130
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

344
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
Your family is sleeping here.

345
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,880
Yes.

346
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
All my family

347
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
fell asleep here.

348
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
All the heroes here are protecting us.

349
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,400
How could I be afraid?

350
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,240
Xu Ziqi.

351
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,640
I'm sorry.

352
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,460
You're bleeding a lot.

353
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,340
Where's the haemostatic you carry with you?

354
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,810
I won't apply medicine on you anymore.

355
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
Xu Ziqi.

356
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
Can you stop getting hurt?

357
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,480
You know I'll be sad if you get hurt.

358
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,400
I'm worried that I'll be sad?

359
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,120
This is my family.

360
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
They'll think I'm bullying you.

361
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
What if they hit me in my dream?

362
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,720
Your family must be as good as you.

363
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,440
Come on.

364
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,460
The one sleeping there

365
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,650
was my great-grandfather.

366
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
the first general of our Xu family.

367
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,040
The position.

368
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,880
The founding general of Tang

369
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
With General Li Jing

370
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,640
with General Li Jing.

371
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,370
...but to protect General Li Jing.

372
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,570
...to protect General Li Jing.

373
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,080
and chopped him to death.

374
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,520
The one sleeping there

375
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,420
is my grandfather.

376
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,200
He is not a general.

377
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,280
He's just an honest scholar.

378
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
When Danyang was in trouble,

379
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,010
he was caught by Danyang

380
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
to threaten my ancestor.

381
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
He killed himself.

382
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,440
His head was chopped off.

383
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,680
So the court

384
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,160
conferred his title as General.

385
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,960
But what's the use?

386
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,880
When he left,

387
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,170
my grandmother was just pregnant.

388
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,000
The one lying here

389
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,520
is me, Aye.

390
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,240
I'll go with my Aye.

391
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,200
We defeated Tugu Chaos.

392
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,900
But I didn't expect

393
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,960
that was the last time I saw him.

394
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,000
On our way back to Chang'an,

395
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,920
the horse suddenly lost control

396
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,200
and threw me into the swamp.

397
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,400
In order to save me,

398
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,040
just to save me.

399
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,040
He lifted me up.

400
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
and

401
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,180
I was stuck in the swamp and couldn't get out.

402
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,120
I was 14.

403
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,960
We tried many ways

404
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,000
but we didn't get him out.

405
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,960
I just watched him

406
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,600
disappear in front of me little by little.

407
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Later,

408
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,010
I went back to Chang'an.

409
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,480
My mother...

410
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,720
She... She was so sad.

411
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,160
She was so sad

412
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,520
and went with me.

413
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
From that day on,

414
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,160
I became an orphan.

415
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Since then,

416
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,600
I lost all my family.

417
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
I can never forget that day.

418
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,970
I rushed into the hospital.

419
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,960
Mother...

420
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,960
didn't have time to say the last word to me.

421
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,880
She grabbed my hand

422
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,040
[She slipped from my face.]

423
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,860
At that moment,

424
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,120
I felt

425
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,680
I have nothing left.

426
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
From that day on,

427
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,960
I sold all my assets.

428
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,680
In Chang'an,

429
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,360
in Chang'an.

430
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,640
I want to give a home

431
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
a home.

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,040
and peaceful.

433
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,880
It's getting bigger.

434
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,200
and better.

435
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,840
But I

436
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,040
still feel homeless.

437
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,720
Dad!

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,840
Yae.

439
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,640
I haven't been back for a long time.

440
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,040
Tang...

441
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,000
The world is peaceful.

442
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,880
The people

443
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
live and work in peace.

444
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,960
My child.

445
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,760
Everything is fine.

446
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,120
I just...

447
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,640
I just miss you.

448
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,960
Why are your eyes red?

449
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,200
I don't know why.

450
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,960
Seeing you sad

451
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,520
I'm sad too.

452
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,720
When I saw you cry,

453
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,240
I want to cry too.

454
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,440
By the way,

455
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,680
Aren't you just a delinquent?

456
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
How could you make such a scene?

457
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,440
You set fire and shot arrows.

458
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,680
Are you hiding something from me?

459
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,880
After today,

460
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,920
my identity will be exposed.

461
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,160
I'll tell you then.

462
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,760
Who are you?

463
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,480
Tell you or not?

464
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,290
You just said you don't need to hide it.

465
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,000
Let me think about it.

466
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,900
How about this?

467
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,920
Tell me who you are.

468
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,440
I'll also tell you who I am.

469
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,840
Who else can you be?

470
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,960
I have a great identity.

471
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm definitely better than you.

472
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Let's do it. Okay.

473
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,760
Fine.

474
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,360
Elder Wen, I didn't do my job well.

475
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
Xu Ziqi and Hua Xiaochi escaped.

476
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,880
Where did they go?

477
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,610
They escaped into the mountain and disappeared.

478
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,880
Useless!

479
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Xu Ziqi...

480
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
is not dead.

481
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,560
You call him brother with a different surname.

482
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
You didn't know he was alive?

483
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,760
I don't know.

484
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,240
Xu Ziqi is an imperial spy.

485
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,200
Under His Majesty's order, he wants to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

486
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Do you know

487
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,100
Xu Ziqi has been in contact with the room so frequently.

488
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm afraid you can't get rid of it.

489
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,960
I...

490
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,160
If Lord Wu hadn't been prepared,

491
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,920
you would have flipped us all.

492
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,200
Master Yi.

493
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,340
You kicked us out of the Chamber of Commerce.

494
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Surprised?

495
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,680
The biggest traitor

496
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,480
was brought up by you.

497
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,680
No.

498
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,640
I had no idea he was a spy.

499
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,920
I had no idea.

500
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,400
You never suspected me.

501
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,000
I...

502
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,000
I never doubted it.

503
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I swear to God

504
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,880
I have never

505
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,880
towards the Chamber of Commerce.

506
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
Never.

507
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,540
Release hatred

508
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
You have no evidence now.

509
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
I can't do anything about it.

510
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,400
Leave. I can't protect you.

511
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,200
Master Yi.

512
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,800
My family is still exiled at the border.

513
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,360
Master Yi.

514
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,160
Get out of here! Get out of here!

515
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Leave.

516
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
All of you

517
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
you asked me to do.

518
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,280
For the past three years,

519
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,360
for the past three years.

520
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,720
Now,

521
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,840
wants to kick me out of the Chamber of Commerce.

522
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,730
It's really a waste of time.

523
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,640
The good bow is hidden. The cunning rabbit is dead.

524
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,760
Dog boiling.

525
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
You don't have to trouble everyone.

526
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,120
I...

527
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
I'll go by myself.

528
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,440
You kicked him out too.

529
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,460
What else do you want to do?

530
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,760
Get rid of him.

531
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,880
Find the assassins.

532
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,250
I'll offer 1,000 taels of gold.

533
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,640
to reward Xu Ziqi.

534
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,920
of Xu Ziqi.

535
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,280
The assassins might not succeed.

536
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,960
Spread the news

537
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,360
is a spy in the palace,

538
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
his enemies will kill him.

539
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
With the help of our ancestors,

540
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,960
the Imperial Agent.

541
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,840
Can you see His Majesty every day?

542
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,120
and go to the palace anytime?

543
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,400
So handsome.

544
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
Still not as handsome as you.

545
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,120
Even your ancestors came out to help you change your fate.

546
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,200
but I think you're talking nonsense.

547
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,440
Wait.

548
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
You said your ancestors

549
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,730
and guide your future fate.

550
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,530
Then you'll be controlled by what he said.

551
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,720
Indeed.

552
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
My mother and dad

553
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,200
owed a lot of money.

554
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,600
That's why he sold me to Zhang Gui-cai.

555
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
That's why I ran away from marriage and killed myself.

556
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,660
I don't want to go back.

557
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,240
I want to stay here.

558
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,240
Although all the experiences in Chang'an

559
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,280
is not as smooth as I thought,

560
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,200
I learned a lot.

561
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,760
and suffered a lot.

562
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,520
But here,

563
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
everyone works hard for life.

564
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,400
This real feeling is simple.

565
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,960
And

566
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,880
I'm happier

567
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,200
than before.

568
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,600
Why?

569
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,220
Because of you.

570
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,360
Because of me.

571
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Because of you.

572
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,120
I saw someone else.

573
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,280
except myself.

574
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,920
I also saw someone else.

575
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
I said these.

576
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,060
Aren't you scared?

577
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm scared.

578
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,840
My identity as an Imperial Agent

579
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,960
has been exposed.

580
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,760
We were hunted down just now.

581
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,890
Now you ask me if I'm scared.

582
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,920
I suddenly feel

583
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,720
I came here

584
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,640
to meet you.

585
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,000
Zheng and Xu Ziqi are in the same place now.

586
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,880
And I

587
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,600
have always

588
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,400
from the beginning.

589
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,440
Lord Xu's identity as a spy

590
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,400
to tell you.

591
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,450
I can't tell you.

592
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,170
Then why did Tong Hua Xiao Zheng say

593
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,460
when Xu Ziqi pretended to be dead,

594
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,040
when Xu Ziqi pretended to be dead.

595
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,850
They love each other every day.

596
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,960
They say

597
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,120
gold is the hardest thing in the world.

598
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,360
Never rotten.

599
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,160
Yang Lin.

600
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,240
Everyone in the mansion thinks I made this statue

601
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,920
to keep Hua Xiao Zheng with gold.

602
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
Actually,

603
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm selfish.

604
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I believe it.

605
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,290
Love is stronger than gold.

606
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,720
But I...

607
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,200
But these two...

608
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,040
the two closest to me

609
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,640
never cared about me.

610
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,160
and never trusted me.

611
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,900
I was distrusted by the Chamber of Commerce.

612
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,640
Tell me,

613
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,680
how can I let them go?

614
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,880
Never.

615
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,040
You...

616
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,560
What's wrong, Xu Ziqi?

617
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,219
Keep quiet.

618
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,659
There's someone else.

619
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,370
Let's go.

620
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,719
Brother Zhang.

621
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,520
Second Master.

622
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,639
Mr. Zhang.

623
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,800
Get up.

624
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,560
Brother Xu, are you okay?

625
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,800
We're fine.

626
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
I was about to wash her hair.

627
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,320
You guys go to the side

628
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
You can roast it after washing it.

629
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,000
Okay.

630
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,080
It's okay.

631
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,920
Slow down.

632
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Okay.

633
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,370
Let's go.

634
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,720
All the dark forces are after you.

635
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,280
The person behind it has rewarded 1,000 taels of gold.

636
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,960
All assassins came out

637
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,280
just to get Brother Xu's head

638
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,960
for a lifetime of wealth.

639
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,760
I brought you water and wine.

640
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,840
Some food

641
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,480
and bedding.

642
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,960
This is an emergency.

643
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,320
I don't know how long you'll be hiding here.

644
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,520
It's good to prepare more.

645
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,880
Also,

646
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
I've prepared a box of money for you.

647
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,160
There are a few boxes in the back.

648
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,360
These are some coins.

649
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
You can spend them anytime.

650
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,760
So many.

651
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,100
Xu Ziqi's identity as a spy has been exposed.

652
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,380
The enemy is after him.

653
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,160
I don't know

654
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
how long you'll stay on this waterway.

655
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I think

656
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
if you have a baby in the future,

657
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,040
these milk bottles diapers open pants,

658
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,960
and cotton

659
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,080
and sewing for you.

660
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,860
We've thought about it. Look at this.

661
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,280
The 1,000 words that the child taught in the morning.

662
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,210
The Three-Character Classic, University Analects

663
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,920
I've prepared everything for you.

664
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,320
There are also things to practice calligraphy.

665
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,250
There are weapons and instruments for martial arts.

666
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,400
I also prepared some bowls and utensils.

667
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,240
If you like cooking,

668
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,560
everything is ready.

669
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,880
Look at you.

670
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,080
It's too safe.

671
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
We're being chased.

672
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,520
It's not convenient for us to show up.

673
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,760
So I borrowed Zhang's boat

674
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,320
for a while.

675
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
After some time,

676
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,520
let's see if there's a right time

677
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,370
and find a place to settle down.

678
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,010
I just don't know

679
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,570
how long it will take to live like this.

680
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,560
Do we have to

681
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,920
all our life?

682
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,490
Take it as a big boat tour around the world.

683
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,280
I don't know when I can see you again.

684
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,400
It's not easy to make it.

685
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,040
Our family business

686
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,640
our own business.

687
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,440
You...

688
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,000
You left us such a big mess.

689
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,560
and just left.

690
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,080
You two should run our shop well.

691
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,120
This is our hard work.

692
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,090
Don't worry.

693
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,960
The moon

694
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,000
It's so round.

695
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,160
So much food.

696
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,840
Eat more. You didn't eat much yesterday.

697
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
I'm afraid you'll be hungry.

698
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,440
Okay.

699
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:43,760
Come on

700
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,780
The boat will depart at midnight.

701
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,500
Brother Zhang said

702
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
the sea has been windy these days.

703
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,560
I'm afraid it'll be too bumpy for you.

704
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,040
You can sleep better after drinking a glass of wine.

705
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,440
Okay.

706
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,120
Aren't you drinking?

707
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,640
I...

708
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,240
hurt my back.

709
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
I can't drink yet.

710
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,640
I'll drink.

711
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,120
It's not spicy at all.

712
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,410
It's sour and sweet.

713
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
This wine

714
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,600
is the wine I specially found for you.

715
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,080
Only Persia has it.

716
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,280
Next,

717
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
Jin'er.

718
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,960
Hero, Zhang Gui Cai,

719
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,920
Yang Debiao

720
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,960
and Yang Debiao's annoying father.

721
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,960
is cute sometimes.

722
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,980
Separating hatred

723
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,360
Husppy

724
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,280
Zheng.

725
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,080
Will you regret going with me?

726
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,120
Are you stupid?

727
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,600
They are important to me.

728
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,760
But you are more important to me.

729
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
Besides,

730
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,040
I gave up my fame and fortune for you.

731
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,760
I even risked my whole family

732
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
If I don't go with you,

733
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,080
it would be a loss.

734
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,320
But...

735
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,280
Is it really worth it?

736
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Do you really not regret

737
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,970
Do you really not regret it?

738
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,080
I'm the only one in my family

739
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,280
besides my ancestors.

740
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,040
and have no contributions

741
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,280
to society.

742
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,860
Your family is different.

743
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,320
Your family is loyal.

744
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,160
Besides, compared to those uncertainties,

745
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,280
than those uncertainties.

746
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,480
My original dream was

747
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,960
to have a big house on the water.

748
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,340
When you open the door,

749
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,120
the endless sea.

750
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,960
Look, it's great now.

751
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,020
We live on the boat.

752
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,320
When you go out,

753
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,370
it'll be the sea.

754
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,890
Isn't it better?

755
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,520
Xu Ziqi.

756
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,000
Is the boat set off?

757
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,320
It feels like

758
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,960
a little...

759
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,920
I feel a little dizzy.

760
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,520
Zheng.

761
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm sorry.

762
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,800
This wine...

763
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
in this wine.

764
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,240
In two hours,

765
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,080
Jin'er will come

766
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,850
I'll come and take you away.

767
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,440
I wanted to write you a letter,

768
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,940
but I was afraid

769
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,240
when you read this letter,

770
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,240
when you see this letter.

771
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,960
So except money,

772
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,720
except money.

773
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,120
Just pretend

774
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,920
know each other.

775
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,000
I can't bear

776
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,720
to let you wander around with me.

777
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,440
and live such a hard life.

778
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,960
The more you say

779
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,120
to travel the world with me,

780
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,100
the more reluctant I am to let you do this.

781
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,040
Maybe our Xu family

782
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,800
is destined to be alone.

783
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,240
You can never be with the one you love.

784
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,560
Zheng.

785
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,360
Don't worry.

786
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,120
No matter where I go,

787
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,720
I will protect the people of that country

788
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,580
and fulfill my ancestral teachings.

789
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,980
For the country and the people

790
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,850
for the country and the people.

791
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Why are you awake?

792
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,960
You didn't make me dizzy.

793
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,810
Jin'er told me everything.

794
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,840
You've been stabbed a thousand times.

795
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,240
Trying to leave me again?

796
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,520
Didn't you play dead last time?

797
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,000
No.

798
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,960
It's for your own good.

799
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,820
I'm afraid you'll suffer with me.

800
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,520
For my own good.

801
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,440
I think you didn't beat me enough.

802
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,120
You even drugged me.

803
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,920
How do you know

804
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,440
How much is the right medicine?

805
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,600
I can't take care of myself if there are too many drugs.

806
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,920
When you leave,

807
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,640
I won't.

808
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,340
I'm experienced. I won't make mistakes.

809
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,020
You're still denying it, aren't you?

810
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,600
No.

811
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,240
Zheng!

812
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,160
No!

813
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,920
That's...

814
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,520
is so cruel.

815
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,720
This scream

816
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,880
It's like being chased by a wolf.

817
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
When Lord Xu and Zhang Gui Cai

818
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,600
to check the water route.

819
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,840
He was practicing the pot in the room.

820
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,970
She only practiced hundreds of times.

821
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,080
She said she had to be strong and steady.

822
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,410
You need to hit someone to vent your anger.

823
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,000
Wait, don't make a sound.

824
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,290
Something's up.

825
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,640
Something happened.

826
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,040
Your butt was hit.

827
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,760
No.

828
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,800
Assassins are all carrying weapons.

829
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,960
They are coming this way.

830
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,960
Brother Xu.

831
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,170
My brother just sent a message.

832
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,480
we found a large team.

833
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,330
It's too late to escape.

834
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,560
They're too fast!

835
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,600
I'll set off now.

836
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,160
There might be a chance of survival.

837
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:26,760
Wait.

838
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,880
There was a slight collision in the sound.

839
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,520
They brought bows and arrows.

840
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,720
Even if we set off now,

841
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,960
it should be too late.

842
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,720
I'll ask all my brothers

843
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
to gather.

844
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,640
Can you swim?

845
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,280
What are you doing?

846
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,240
Now the enemy is coming.

847
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,760
Jump into the water first.

848
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,490
That way, you won't get caught.

849
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,720
Diving.

850
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,440
Jin'er.

851
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm afraid if I die today,

852
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,370
I won't have the chance to say I love you again.

853
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,560
I love you so many times.

854
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,360
We'll die together.

855
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,840
Let's live together.

856
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,760
Xiao Zheng, jump!

857
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,240
They are not sober.

858
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,520
You're not sober with them.

859
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,880
What did you say?

860
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,680
At least he can swing the pot.

861
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,700
What can you do?

862
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,880
You'll only be a burden if you stay.

863
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,160
What do you mean?

864
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,890
I think we should die early.

865
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,920
Brother Zhang and I are usually in the martial world.

866
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,120
We've been living on the edge of a knife.

867
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,120
Yes.

868
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,640
We've decided to fight.

869
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,840
hoping you can live well.

870
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,040
Now that the army is approaching the city,

871
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,640
I'm ready to die.

872
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,040
I won't hesitate

873
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
no matter what.

874
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,080
Zheng.

875
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,840
This time,

876
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,810
We're really going to be apart.

877
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,600
Xu Ziqi.

878
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,640
Come on.

879
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

880
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,280
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.
