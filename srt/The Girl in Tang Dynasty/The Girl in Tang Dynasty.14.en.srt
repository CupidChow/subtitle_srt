1
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Lunch time

2
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,600
Lecher

3
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

4
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,240
Come on.

5
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,640
Here.

6
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
What's wrong?

7
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,760
Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine.

8
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,520
My liver.

9
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,160
[Liver]

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,240
Okay. Okay.

11
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
It hurts everywhere.

12
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,640
But besides covering your heart,

13
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,920
other organs are not there.

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
It doesn't matter

15
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,050
What's important is that I'm in pain everywhere.

16
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,320
Am I dying?

17
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,120
You...

18
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,770
You know how to treat patients?

19
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,560
I've been a soldier since I was a kid.

20
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,680
There are many soldiers in the army.

21
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,640
and there are not enough soldiers.

22
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
So I

23
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,520
I've been learning medicine from the military doctor since I was a kid.

24
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Don't talk.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,080
Let me see what's wrong with you.

26
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,960
Well...

27
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,560
They said it's hard to get a pulse.

28
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
My disease is aching everywhere.

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,620
It must be a complicated disease.

30
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
I know what disease you have.

31
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,640
Your internal depression

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,100
My heart is not going well.

33
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,079
You're just anxious.

34
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,240
Exactly.

35
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm locked up here every day.

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,540
I need to go out for some fresh air.

37
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,640
Someone, bring my silver needle.

38
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Don't worry. I'll be fine after a few hundred stitches.

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
So many needles.

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,040
Look.

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,079
Just put the needle on the fire.

42
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
When it's hot,

43
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,740
Take this strength

44
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,000
deep

45
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,360
into the acupoints on your head.

46
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,640
It'll be cured.

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
It suddenly feels good.

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,120
Do you think I'm very energetic?

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,440
Do you need needles?

50
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,680
No, no, no.

51
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,200
I don't feel like eating.

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,400
everything is great.

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,440
Room No.1 is a perfect place.

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,640
I'll turn upside down if I stay for two more days.

55
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,760
Do you still need needles?

56
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,360
No.

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,440
Really?

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,440
Shall we eat?

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,880
Yes.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
Are you sure?

61
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,960
No.

62
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,640
What a pity.

63
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,080
No, no, no.

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,380
I won't prick anymore.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,730
Learn how to flip your hand.

66
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,000
Take care.

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
Mr. Xu, you haven't eaten for a day.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
He said he had no appetite.

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
What if something goes wrong if you keep starving?

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,600
Hua Xiaochi, I heard you're on a hunger strike.

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
I'll have appetite if you let me out.

72
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Xiao Zheng, hang in there.

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,100
I'll starve for two more days.

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,760
Just two days. Xu Ziqi will definitely let you out.

75
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,320
Hang in there.

76
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
It smells good.

77
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,200
It smells good

78
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,060
It smells good.

79
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,320
Open the door.

80
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm hungry.

81
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
I...

82
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,020
I have no appetite.

83
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,020
Then just wait.

84
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,890
It's delicious.

85
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
Don't mumble when you eat.

86
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,680
Why?

87
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,680
It looks

88
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Looks delicious

89
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,409
I'm really good at cooking.

90
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,080
Didn't you eat it before?

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,200
It's good. It's delicious.

92
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
You eat so many dishes alone.

93
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,810
Can you finish them?

94
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,020
Just throw it away if you can't finish it.

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Why not...

96
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Yeah.

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,800
Why don't we share it with everyone?

98
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Come on, guys.

99
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,680
Coming.

100
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Come on.

101
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Eat slowly.

102
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,180
Be careful.

103
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,050
Everyone has it. Don't grab it.

104
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Take more of this.

105
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,240
Here.

106
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,580
There's another dish.

107
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,880
There's shrimp here.

108
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,640
Celery cabbage

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Radish

110
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
I want to steam rice with milk

111
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,760
But these are all dishes that can't stay overnight

112
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,880
It's a waste if you don't eat them.

113
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,400
Forget it.

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,440
I...

115
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,960
Eat.

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,799
Eat it.

117
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,600
I'll eat it.

118
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
I'll eat it, okay?

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,720
But I'm tired now.

120
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
I don't want to do it anymore.

121
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,560
Didn't you say it's a waste not to fry it?

122
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,960
You liar!

123
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Stir-fry. Right away.

124
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,210
It'll be ready soon.

125
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,720
What are these?

126
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,780
Anything else?

127
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,200
One dish is not enough.

128
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
I left three dishes for you.

129
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
There are crab meat balls

130
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
and mushroom soup with abalone sauce.

131
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,680
And dumplings with spinach.

132
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,410
I'll cook another dish for you.

133
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,840
Hua Xiao Zheng.

134
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
You loser.

135
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,160
You ate all the dishes.

136
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,840
and ordered three meals a day.

137
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,280
I can't get out now.

138
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,680
Xu Ziqi is really good at cooking.

139
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,800
No, Hua Xiaochi.

140
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,080
Don't give in.

141
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,700
Why don't we order some mapo tofu?

142
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,040
Hua Xiaochi, wake up.

143
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
Instead of this,

144
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,760
It's better to have a short pain.

145
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,120
I might as well just kill myself.

146
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,480
We can send a doctor in tomorrow.

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,080
Then I can escape.

148
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,800
Yes.

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,820
It's a bit hard.

150
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
Come on.

151
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
Three.

152
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,680
You...

153
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,320
You...

154
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,560
Why are you awake?

155
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
Are you having insomnia?

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,600
Why is the wall so soft?

157
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,160
You...

158
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,400
Sorry to wake you up.

159
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,800
I'll be gentle next time.

160
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,080
Next time?

161
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
How dare you try to kill yourself

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,040
after the swing last time?

163
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
Then don't lock me up.

164
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm locking you up.

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,320
I locked you to protect you.

166
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,440
What if I was too late?

167
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
What if I came in late?

168
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,440
Do you know

169
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,960
if you hit your head?

170
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,720
What if I didn't hug you?

171
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,290
Are you out of your mind?

172
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Xu Ziqi.

173
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,720
You...

174
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,140
What are you doing?

175
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,340
If you kill yourself again, I'll hug you.

176
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
You're holding me too tight.

177
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,960
Be quiet.

178
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Cut the crap.

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,840
I ate too much.

180
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
You're holding me too tight.

181
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
I'll loosen it a little.

182
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,330
But I still have to hold you.

183
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
If you want me to let go, stay still.

184
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,280
Let go of me!

185
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,800
I will still crash into the wall.

186
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,680
No way.

187
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,410
Where is Xu Ziqi?

188
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,320
Lord Xu has something to deal with.

189
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,580
He'll be back tonight.

190
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,080
Last night,

191
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
did you hear

192
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
fluttering?

193
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,640
I heard it.

194
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,330
It should be an earthquake.

195
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,200
An earthquake? How could it be an earthquake?

196
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
You have no idea.

197
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,160
It has rhythm.

198
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,680
I guess

199
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
someone is playing the drum.

200
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,680
Nonsense.

201
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,280
Go.

202
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
No way.

203
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,600
This is our chance.

204
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,060
The door is not locked.

205
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,040
Why not?

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,800
Isn't it you?

207
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,960
At this point,

208
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
you've defiled my innocence.

209
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,800
I might as well kill myself.

210
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
No, no, no.

211
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,280
You...

212
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,280
You...

213
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,440
You...

214
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Jin'er!

215
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,840
Take her out.

216
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Hero!

217
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,280
All right.

218
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
You useless people.

219
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,880
If anyone lets her escape again,

220
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
get in!

221
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,660
Hua Xiao Zheng!

222
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,480
I thought you ran out

223
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200
to find Li

224
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
to discuss the matters of the Oiran.

225
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,560
But you...

226
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
You took off the hero's clothes.

227
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,960
You...

228
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Is this why you escaped from prison?

229
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
Tell me then.

230
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,040
There are so many men in Chang'an.

231
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,770
Who else do you want to take off?

232
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,600
I've done everything I could.

233
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,720
I dare not.

234
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,920
I dare not.

235
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,300
You can't do it even if you want to.

236
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,850
Since the founding of Tang,

237
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,280
you were the first woman who was imprisoned

238
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,720
for harassing women.

239
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,980
You can't go anywhere.

240
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,680
Just stay here.

241
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,260
Keep an eye on them.

242
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes.

243
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,610
I'm here to take Hua Xiao Zheng out.

244
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
Xu Ziqi, listen.

245
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,580
What order?

246
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,180
You also saw the authenticity of this order.

247
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Xu Ziqi, listen to me.

248
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,160
But Hua Xiaochi has committed a crime.

249
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
How can she just let it go?

250
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,680
It says

251
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,340
Release immediately.

252
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,200
Li,

253
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,220
It doesn't make sense.

254
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
It's unreasonable

255
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,360
to send him to prison.

256
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,960
All right, Ziqi.

257
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,280
Stop asking about the document.

258
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,440
Li,

259
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,280
This man can turn his hands over and turn his hands into rain.

260
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,540
and free the criminal.

261
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,060
Don't fall deeper and deeper.

262
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,460
He is definitely not a simple person.

263
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,770
Leave the business of the Chamber of Commerce alone.

264
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,400
Zheng.

265
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,440
I told you I would save you.

266
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,920
Release hatred. Thank you.

267
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,280
Thank you.

268
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,660
How dare you take off another man's clothes?

269
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,440
This...

270
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
You knew?

271
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,980
I know why you did that.

272
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,280
You know?

273
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
You peeled my clothes a few days ago.

274
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,520
But I was too cold to you.

275
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,040
That's why you provoked me in this way.

276
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,440
You're really...

277
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
You're so smart.

278
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,520
So smart.

279
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,920
I really want to do it.

280
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,040
Just peel me.

281
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
I didn't expect you to be so shy

282
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
you would be so shy.

283
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,840
Yes.

284
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,840
Shy

285
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,100
This is not the way back to the mansion

286
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,120
It's so lively.

287
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,120
This is...

288
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,440
On the way to Pingkang Fang.

289
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,440
The new Oiran touring street will be held in a few days.

290
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,140
Your first public appearance

291
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,460
is very important.

292
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
You should practice harder.

293
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
But you wasted two days in prison.

294
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
There are only three days left.

295
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,640
I've talked to Coach Xue.

296
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,480
Learn from Xue Jiafang in the next three days.

297
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Rules of the Oiran roaming the streets.

298
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
You must succeed.

299
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,040
Teach me personally, Coach Xue.

300
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,660
Professor Seol only provides the venue.

301
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,120
Your people

302
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
is the one who knows the Oiran best.

303
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,760
Could it be...

304
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,880
Why is there a physical punishment?

305
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,600
You...

306
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,040
Are you

307
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,880
for personal revenge?

308
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,240
Mr. Fang only said

309
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,960
what the result is.

310
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,600
I didn't say what kind of process it was.

311
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,400
Stand still.

312
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,960
Don't shrink.

313
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,900
Straighten your back.

314
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,920
Raise your head.

315
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,240
Or I'll beat you.

316
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,160
Hero,

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,160
I was rude yesterday.

318
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,840
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,840
Jin'er.

320
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,360
I thought your guideline was not thorny.

321
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
I found you

322
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
a thorn for you for ten years.

323
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,680
I heard that

324
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,170
no matter how thick the skin is,

325
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,520
I can wear it

326
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,600
Take it.

327
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,720
What?

328
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,160
Do you still want to fold it?

329
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,840
How about this one?

330
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,450
you break it too?

331
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,160
Hold this jar

332
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,880
Walk steadily.

333
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,640
Don't move your head.

334
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,940
Don't shake your body.

335
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,060
Don't drop the jar.

336
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,680
If you smash it, I'll hit you.

337
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,440
This is too heavy.

338
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,040
Be careful.

339
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,520
This is only a few hundred years old antique.

340
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,600
I'll smash it and compensate you with hundreds of taels of gold.

341
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,240
I will

342
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
walk well.

343
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,040
Wait.

344
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,040
Gu Gu! Gu Jin'er!

345
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,040
Look.

346
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,200
Look at my neck.

347
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,160
Is it squeezed?

348
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
Cut the crap.

349
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,760
Keep the distance together.

350
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
Move your hands naturally.

351
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,280
Put it on.

352
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,520
Are you sure it's not revenge?

353
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,360
If Mr. Fang and the Chamber of Commerce hadn't forced me,

354
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,760
I would have hit you.

355
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Who are you putting on a long face for?

356
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Do you think I want to torture you?

357
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,680
These are what I got from the previous Oiran.

358
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,040
That's how I was trained by Coach Xue.

359
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,880
I was holding on

360
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,720
was a real rock.

361
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440
fell down.

362
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,240
My toes were smashed.

363
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,640
This is nothing.

364
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,640
I'm not aiming at you.

365
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,770
It's not that I don't want to practice.

366
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,560
I just don't understand.

367
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,120
What?

368
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Gu Jin'er.

369
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
You and I represent different people.

370
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,530
Do you know what I'm saying?

371
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,560
Something like that.

372
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
Well,

373
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,680
You're tall.

374
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm down-to-earth.

375
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,500
We're not representing the same kind of people.

376
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,440
I won,

377
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,960
but I won the ticket of ordinary people.

378
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
Last second I said I represent the people

379
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
and wore gold and silver in the next second.

380
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,680
Isn't this embarrassing?

381
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,680
You're acting like a whore.

382
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,620
I didn't mean to scold you.

384
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,640
Actually,

385
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,680
I think you deserve

386
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,040
you deserve it.

387
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,640
Did I hear it right?

388
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,600
Are you praising me?

389
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,200
Although we're rivals,

390
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,880
we can still talk openly.

391
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,440
As the Oiran,

392
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm just a puppet.

393
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,920
You have a soul.

394
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,440
Actually, what you said on the final day

395
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
I was convinced.

396
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm not used to the sudden compliment.

397
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,280
Actually, I quite admire you.

398
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,120
You're great.

399
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
Look, you're an all-rounder.

400
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,520
and beautiful.

401
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,680
Look at me. I have everything.

402
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,240
Except being smart,

403
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,160
and a little cute.

404
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,570
You don't have to compliment me politely.

405
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,960
We'll be enemies for a long time.

406
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,760
Why do you change your mind faster than turning a page?

407
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,680
Make it clear.

408
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,920
and less trouble.

409
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,960
I hate

410
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,200
the secret struggle in Pingkang Fang.

411
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,040
Boring.

412
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,240
I think you're an honest person.

413
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,720
I don't have to be the Oiran anymore.

414
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,840
And?

415
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,680
You have to shut the door and talk.

416
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
I want to redeem myself.

417
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,040
And...

418
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
I'm going after Mr. Bang, of course.

419
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,920
But

420
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,240
Zhang Gui is so nice to you.

421
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,400
But Mr. Fang has been my dream for years.

422
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,840
I have to get enough.

423
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
You won't regret if you try hard.

424
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
I support you.

425
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,840
You support me chasing Mr. Fang.

426
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,640
Aren't you

427
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,200
with Mr. Fang?

428
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,920
Well...

429
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,200
I...

430
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,920
You don't like Mr. Fang?

431
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
It's a marriage matter.

432
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
No kidding.

433
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400
I can't be casual either.

434
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
I have to try my best.

435
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Then fight for it.

436
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,960
Work hard, humble, grateful

437
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,970
Keep fighting for your dream and you'll catch up.

438
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,380
Do we know each other well?

439
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,220
Why do I talk so much to you?

440
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,880
I think we can be more familiar.

441
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,900
Let's get along with the rival in love first.

442
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,040
Step by step.

443
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,960
Okay.

444
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,640
No.

445
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,280
I think

446
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,000
let's deal with

447
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,660
about your prostitute first.

448
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,960
You have a point.

449
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,280
you and I

450
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,000
is not up to you and me.

451
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,640
It's not up to you.

452
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
It's up to the Chamber of Commerce.

453
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,720
After all, you have to practice hard.

454
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,720
Otherwise, all of us will suffer.

455
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,240
You understand.

456
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,240
What now?

457
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
Jin'er.

458
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,980
I'm afraid these glasses won't work.

459
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,360
I went to the blacksmith's shop

460
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,480
with a lot of money.

461
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,640
a silver needle

462
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,880
Invisible.

463
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
It's more durable than a strip.

464
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,840
That Young Master Ying...

465
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,120
You don't have to hate me so much.

466
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,120
Stab her.

467
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,280
Isn't it pretty? It's not.

468
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,840
This is not

469
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
in a few days.

470
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
If Miss Yun

471
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,840
just sit in the Luan carriage,

472
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,160
You can't show it in front of the car.

473
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,880
I mean

474
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,520
break her legs.

475
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,120
No.

476
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,340
That's a good idea.

477
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,000
Or

478
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,840
let the dancer dance around the crown tomorrow

479
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,000
to cover her steps.

480
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,520
I think

481
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,440
we can come up with a better way.

482
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,500
and think about it.

483
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,620
I think this will work.

484
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,780
Just do it this way.

485
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,840
No.

486
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,600
No no no

487
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Just do it like this.

488
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,120
It's good.

489
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,640
No.

490
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
We need to think about something else.

491
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,200
Yes. Yes.

492
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:30,960
I agree.

493
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,280
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

494
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,040
Think again.

495
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,600
Why do I feel like I'm dying before I succeed?

496
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,530
What should I do?

497
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,440
There are so many people watching tomorrow.

498
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm sure we'll mess it up.

499
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,610
Why didn't you take the front door?

500
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,040
I'm afraid Li doesn't want to see me.

501
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,680
I don’t want to see him now.

502
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,600
If I knew it would be so hard for the Oiran to travel the streets,

503
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,880
I would've stayed in prison.

504
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,200
Indeed.

505
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,960
When I was on the roof,

506
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,400
when I was on the roof.

507
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
You were like a butcher.

508
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,960
I was so worried.

509
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,520
How could you say that?

510
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
Can't you comfort me?

511
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,600
I'll be generous tomorrow.

512
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,120
Well...

513
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,930
Are you not mad anymore?

514
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,900
If you're still stressed,

515
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,000
you can hit me more.

516
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,600
I just think

517
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
I don't look like a Oiran.

518
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Look at you.

519
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
When you were in prison,

520
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,880
I told you to think carefully

521
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,250
Why do you have to go out?

522
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,140
I'm hesitant when I'm out.

523
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,680
You

524
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,900
Don't compare yourself to Gu Jin'er.

525
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,440
You are you and she is her.

526
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,120
Remember, even if you don't go shopping,

527
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,580
you'll still be the Oiran.

528
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,840
And most importantly,

529
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
do you want to be yourself?

530
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,240
in your heart?

531
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,520
It's only been three days.

532
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,680
You lost weight again.

533
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,360
The food in Pingkang Fang is not good.

534
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,440
I’ll find a chance to feed you.

535
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,200
Hello.

536
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,000
Hello

537
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,720
Hello

538
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,840
Hello.

539
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,680
Your ex-sister-in-law is pretty.

540
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,620
How many times have I told you not to call me that?

541
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,000
Why is Chairman Bang

542
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,760
Why are you kneeling alone?

543
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,200
Mr. Bang will represent the Chamber of Commerce

544
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,260
on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce.

545
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,680
Isn't this the matter of the four Elders?

546
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,200
Why did you let Chairman Bang kneel alone?

547
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
I don't know.

548
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,280
Miss Zheng

549
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,600
Everyone is watching.

550
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,060
Please continue to dance.

551
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
Your Excellency, the new Oiran is not bad.

552
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,160
She looks like a Oiran.

553
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,440
Please teach me in the future.

554
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,000
Of course, I will serve the court.

555
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,480
So beautiful.

556
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,440
Mr. Fang works so hard every year.

557
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,000
I really admire him.

558
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,600
He got to where he is today

559
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,440
because of the favor of the Chamber of Commerce and the lords.

560
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,880
so that he can pray for the people.

561
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,560
He has to do his best.

562
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,400
It's raining.

563
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,440
The rain is too heavy.

564
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,800
Let's go.

565
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,960
Hurry!

566
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,880
Stop the car!

567
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,440
What are you doing?

568
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
Leave me alone.

569
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Don't follow me.

570
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,440
No.

571
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,300
Xiao Zheng, hurry back to the Luan carriage.

572
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,810
Go back quickly.

573
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,360
Don't just block the rain.

574
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,600
It works if you are sincere.

575
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
The rain will be disrespectful to the gods.

576
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,520
Go back

577
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,010
The adults are watching

578
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
Go back.

579
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
Hua Xiaochi

580
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
Good job.

581
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,400
Didn't you say that praying on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce

582
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,120
If you are sincere, it will work.

583
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,240
I'm the Oiran of the Chamber of Commerce.

584
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,080
I'll kneel down with you

585
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,920
kneel down

586
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,000
Isn't it more effective?

587
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,320
Husppy

588
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,320
I guess the people behind

589
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,560
can't hear me.

590
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
Pass my words to everyone louder.

591
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,400
Go.

592
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,240
Yes.

593
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,960
Ms. Zheng said

594
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,440
she wants to kneel down with her husband.

595
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,700
to pray for the people.

596
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,520
What's wrong?

597
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,760
The dress is too heavy.

598
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,720
This won't do.

599
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,530
How long are we going to walk like this?

600
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,180
Do you see the light pole in front?

601
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,900
We're almost there. Let's go.

602
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,260
Go through that tower.

603
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Ten more seats.

604
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,580
Do you kneel like this every year?

605
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,000
Yes.

606
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,210
Come on. Come on.

607
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,720
Kneel.

608
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,820
Let's kneel together.

609
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,970
What do you mean?

610
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,440
Zheng.

611
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,180
Xiao...

612
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,080
Separate hatred.

613
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
Hua Xiaochi

614
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,280
My sincerity touched heaven and earth.

615
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,880
I am a deity who descended to Chang'an.

616
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,280
If all beings want me to protect you,

617
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,440
I only need the four Elders to kneel before me.

618
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,240
I will ensure the weather in Chang'an in a year.

619
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,000
Okay.

620
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,800
The deity has shown himself.

621
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
The deity has shown himself.

622
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,640
As long as the four Elders kneel before the deity,

623
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,160
the weather in Chang'an will be smooth every year.

624
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,960
That's right. You should kneel too.

625
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,800
Kneel! Kneel!

626
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,400
Kneel!

627
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,240
The Heavenly Deity has shown his presence.

628
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,480
Why aren't the four Elders kneeling?

629
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
Is this true?

630
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,560
Should we kneel or not?

631
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm afraid

632
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,720
I'm afraid it's not true.

633
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,760
I won't kneel.

634
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's wait and see.

635
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
The deity has shown his presence.

636
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
If you don't kneel,

637
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,440
if Chang'an is not peaceful this year,

638
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
you will all be beheaded.

639
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,000
Why aren't you kneeling?

640
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,360
What are you waiting for?

641
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,520
Go kneel!

642
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,160
That's right.

643
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,120
Kneel!

644
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,360
Hurry up!

645
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,520
What are you waiting for? Drag him out.

646
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,240
Hurry!

647
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,580
Xiao Zheng.

648
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,440
The elders are on their knees.

649
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,040
Enough?

650
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,920
Zheng!

651
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,040
Wake up!

652
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,490
Wake up, Xiao Zheng.

653
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
If I wake up,

654
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,400
if I wake up.

655
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,800
Ask the doctor to take me away.

656
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,380
Xiao Zheng!

657
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,120
Zheng!

658
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,240
Zheng!

659
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,120
Doctor!

660
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,880
Zheng.

661
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,410
Hurry up.

662
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,080
Doctor.

663
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,380
Xiao Zheng.

664
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,560
Zheng!

665
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,010
Call the doctor.

666
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,320
Zheng.

667
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,720
Boss

668
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,400
Doctor.

669
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,240
Why don't you go and check on her?

670
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,520
She passed out by lightning again.

671
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,450
Xiao Zheng laughed so much just now

672
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,360
I can't see it.

673
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,560
You're so bad at acting

674
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,400
That's enough

675
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,320
I don't even kneel down.

676
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
Go lie down.

677
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,120
Keep kneeling.

678
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,760
Why? Why do you make me kneel?

679
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,920
Get up.

680
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,480
Zheng.

681
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,920
Why do you listen to what they say?

682
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,040
We really did nothing wrong.

683
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,130
What are you yelling about?

684
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
I told you before.

685
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,280
Mr. Bang

686
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,000
And this bumpkin.

687
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,000
They can't do anything well.

688
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,700
Why should we choose them to be the president and the Oiran?

689
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,960
Zheng!

690
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,000
You bumpkin!

691
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,640
Zheng.

692
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,920
You know Ban Li resentment is the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

693
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,440
How dare you do this to him?

694
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,000
You...

695
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,840
Zheng, get up.

696
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,440
Get up.

697
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,380
Xiao Zheng.

698
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,320
Get up.

699
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,480
Do you know who Separation is?

700
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,840
For this woman,

701
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,960
for this woman,

702
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,960
and the relationship

703
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,960
and the Chamber of Commerce.

704
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
In public,

705
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,170
Don't you know your status?

706
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,720
You surrendered yourself.

707
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,120
and become a couple

708
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,240
in pairs.

709
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,360
You still don't know who Separation is, do you?

710
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,040
I believe except you,

711
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,280
everyone in Chang'an

712
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,840
many people

713
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,360
don't know who Mr. Fang is.

714
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,580
Have you heard?

715
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,480
That house was a sinner

716
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,940
was a sinner who entered the trade register.

717
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,240
Business registration?

718
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,840
Isn't that the lowest household register?

719
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,700
Mr. Bang and Mr. Bang are calling.

720
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,300
Yesterday, I found out

721
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,440
the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is the face of the Chamber of Commerce.

722
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,570
When I chose a house,

723
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,720
was because he liked the good appearance of the son.

724
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,520
The president

725
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,360
is not qualified to be in charge of any Chamber of Commerce.

726
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,420
It's just a puppet.

727
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,160
Mr. Fang, you made such a scene

728
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,040
is a fool.

729
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,600
Yes.

730
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,960
Lord Xu.

731
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,880
Who told you these?

732
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,440
Please calm down, Lord Xu.

733
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,280
We didn't make it up.

734
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,800
The elders of the Chamber of Commerce

735
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,920
in the tea house early in the morning.

736
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,440
Yes.

737
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,880
It's all over the place.

738
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,040
It’s my fault

739
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,720
is indeed my doing.

740
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,440
Yes.

741
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,480
Yes, I didn't expect that.

742
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,440
It's a low class

743
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,240
Yes.

744
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,840
Who would have thought

745
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,920
is a merchant.

746
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,320
and a sinner.

747
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
How can I raise my head when I go out?

748
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,520
I'm too ashamed to face anyone.

749
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,600
Why don't you quit and leave as soon as possible?

750
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,400
That's right.

751
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,040
Open the door! Open the door!

752
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,400
Open the door! Open the door!

753
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,460
Separating hatred

754
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,800
Zheng.

755
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,610
What's wrong? Still not opening the door?

756
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,400
He has locked himself inside

757
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,720
for more than two hours.

758
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,850
He didn't say a word.

759
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,380
What happened after that?

760
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
So what?

761
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,880
Is it that serious?

762
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,720
I really don't understand the rules in Chang'an.

763
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,520
After a sinner,

764
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,080
I've been looked down upon.

765
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,560
As for business registration,

766
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,240
As the saying goes,

767
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,440
is the last.

768
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,140
People have always looked down on me.

769
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,840
What a pity.

770
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,240
Go back first.

771
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,400
Leave him to me.

772
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,720
But...

773
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,720
No buts.

774
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,720
Li.

775
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,080
Open the door!

776
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,800
Open the door!

777
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
I'll kick you if you don't open the door.

778
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,400
Three, two,
