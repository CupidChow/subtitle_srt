00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 8

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,480
Captain Xu, what brings you

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,920
to visit my manor.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,390
What business do you have?

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,640
We found Wuying's body in the outskirts.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,160
The coroner said he died the night before last.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,350
An eyewitness said.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,240
Lord Su was the last person.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,350
Wuying saw before he died.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,150
Nonsense!

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,150
We were together the night before last.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,840
How could he have gone out to kill someone?

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,150
Do you have any proof?

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,710
Do we need to leave you evidence

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,070
of what we did as a couple?

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,110
Captain Xu.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,790
How dare you?

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,200
If that's the case

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,200
I'll take my leave.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
Please forgive me, General.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,870
It seems you've finally made your move.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,310
Who killed Wuying?

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,430
Dear, why are you still thinking about this?

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,230
I just can't figure it out

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,430
who killed Wuying

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,350
and pinned the blame on you?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,480
You're just a Minister of Rites.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,790
What would he gain by framing you?

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,480
Perhaps only the one who framed me

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,840
knows why.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,350
Dear, I knew it was you.

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,710
Your footsteps are unique.

34
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,310
I recognized them as soon as I heard them.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
I have something to give you.

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,870
Then you give it to me first.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,590
Okay.

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,750
The clothes I bought for you a few days ago,

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,870
there were too few decorations.

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,840
It will look better if you wear this.

41
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
A fragrant sachet.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,590
This is the gift you were talking about before?

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,240
Yes.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,310
The male virtue class taught this before.

45
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,030
How do you think I did?

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,710
If it wasn't made to look like a pig's head,

47
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,400
it might have been better.

48
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm not...

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,840
trying to find you at a glance in a crowd?

50
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,360
This is a secret code that only belongs to the two of us.

51
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,000
This is for you.

52
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,120
If I'm not by your side,

53
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,240
use this for self-defense.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,560
Dear,

55
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,630
I knew you loved me deeply.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Do you want it?

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,870
If you don't want it, forget it.

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
I do.

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,000
Of course I'll keep it since it's from you.

60
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,150
I should go and greet grandfather.

61
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,630
I'll go with you.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,360
Okay.

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,960
Let's go.

64
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,590
Let's go.

65
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,150
Yesterday, your grandfather Li's grandson

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,280
could recite the Three Character Classic.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
The day before yesterday, your grandfather Wang's child

68
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,150
could help with the soy sauce.

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,910
And the day before that.

70
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,800
Old man.

71
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
You did it on purpose.

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,080
My precious granddaughter and grandson-in-law.

73
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,120
You two have been married for some time now.

74
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,310
Isn't it time to have a child.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,280
Grandpa.

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,070
It'll be hard on Lingxi to have a baby.

77
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,870
When she wants to have a child

78
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,430
we'll have a child.

79
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,040
In this matter.

80
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,190
We'll listen to her opinion.

81
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,120
Old man, see that.

82
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,630
My people listen to me.

83
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,430
Okay.

84
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,240
You two can discuss it

85
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,240
I won't say anything as a grandfather.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,830
It's just that Grandpa is idle at home now.

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,160
Bored out of my mind.

88
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,040
Whenever I see other people's grandchildren

89
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,000
I want to hold them and touch them.

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Old man.

91
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,390
You're really going all out to get me to have a child.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,950
He said to listen to me.

93
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,830
You should just stay home

94
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,360
and enjoy a few days of peace.

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,310
Maybe one day I'll be in a good mood.

96
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
And give you a bunch of great-grandchildren.

97
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,310
So you'll be so busy looking after
them you won't know what to do.

98
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,870
That would be great.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
The more you have, the happier I'll be

100
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,480
I have to be able to look after them all.

101
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,430
You lose.

102
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,680
Old man, you're cheating.

103
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,390
Dear.

104
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
Do you still want to divorce me?

105
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,680
It depends on your behavior.

106
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,310
Then I'll have to behave myself

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,270
so you never want to divorce me for the rest of your life.

108
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,310
That's for sure.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,390
Dear.

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Dear, again?

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
What?

112
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,000
Are you scared?

113
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,310
I can't.

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,430
Young Master, what's wrong?

115
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Sit down, sit down.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,070
Don't mention it.

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,510
My wife insisted on buying me clothes.

118
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,630
I'm exhausted from walking all this way.

119
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,830
You usually get up in the morning.

120
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,270
Aren't you usually quite energetic?

121
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Why can't you go shopping?

122
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,390
Young Master.

123
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll go find a doctor right now.

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,160
To prescribe some medicine to help you recover.

125
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Come back, come back.

126
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,360
Although I went to the Zhichen Silk Shop today.

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,240
I didn't see the shopkeeper.

128
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,120
I have to go again.

129
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,310
You must help me stall my wife.

130
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,240
Then.

131
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,680
I'll let her sleep a little longer.

132
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Alright.

133
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
Go.

134
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,120
Yes, Young Master.

135
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,510
Ah Xue.

136
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
Are you going to send pear soup to the general?

137
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,600
Yes.

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,270
Miss has been shopping all day

139
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,160
I stewed pear soup for her to soothe her throat.

140
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,680
Ah Xue.

141
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,600
Actually, I...

142
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,630
I want to.

143
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,560
I know what you mean

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
I've been thinking about it.

145
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,600
Really?

146
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,070
You also think the pear soup is too hot to handle

147
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,750
I should be the one to send it to the general, right?

148
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,390
Ah Wen, you idiot.

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
Miss.

150
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,390
Miss, Miss, wake up quickly.

151
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,240
Miss.

152
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,870
What's the matter?

153
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,750
The Crown Prince sent someone to inform
that something happened at the military camp.

154
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,320
He asked you to go and take a look quickly.

155
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,870
Master, why are you back from outside?

156
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,840
I went to buy chestnut cakes that your Miss loves to eat.

157
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,630
Where is she?

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,750
Miss went to the military camp.

159
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,200
She went to the military camp?

160
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,440
She's not on duty today.

161
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
What happened?

162
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,720
I don't know.

163
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,870
The Crown Prince's men came to report
that something happened at the military camp.

164
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,200
He asked Miss to go quickly.

165
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
How long has she been gone?

166
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,150
Almost a quarter of an hour.

167
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Who sent you here?

168
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,240
A dying person doesn't need to know so much.
