00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 4

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,550
Are you okay?

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,230
Dear, what grudge do we have?

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,440
Why are you using so much force?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm practicing my moves.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,280
You stood behind me without saying a word.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Do you need something from me?

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,560
Dear, I've brought you something.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,520
Is this all you've brought me?

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,350
You're always out in the sun and wind at the military camp.

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,750
This is the most fashionable
rouge and powder in the capital.

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,280
Try it.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,200
I never use this. Take it away.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,480
Dear.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,150
There's a first time for everything.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,680
Let me apply it for you.

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,070
You're right.

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,510
There's a first time for everything.

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,150
Let's try it. Come.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Miss.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
The old general has sent a box of pastries.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,120
For you and your husband to eat.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,950
Miss. Miss.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,790
Miss, you've put on makeup.

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,590
Are you serious about that half-step back move?

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,070
Miss, how could you put on makeup?

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,560
You're allergic to makeup.

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
You don't understand.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,150
I can't bear to lose my beauty,
so I can't divorce my husband.

31
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,230
Thief?

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,630
You dare to steal from the General's Manor.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,030
I respect you for being a man.

34
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,360
Thief, thief, you dare to steal from the General's Manor.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,520
What are you doing?

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,470
Dear, I caught a thief.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,120
Grandpa.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Grandpa, it's not.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,470
Get lost.

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,710
Grandpa has gone back.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,400
He said that because you protected me.

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,560
He won't bother with you.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
But don't do it again.

44
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,030
This medicine is very effective, use it.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,680
Dear, your face...

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,310
Allergic.

47
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,870
If there really is a thief

48
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,430
and you just rush out...

49
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,310
It would be strange if you
didn't get beaten up by the thief.

50
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,240
That would be great.

51
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,590
If the thief beat me

52
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,960
he won't steal from our house.

53
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,870
Come here.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Dear, why do you have an allergic reaction?

55
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,470
Did you eat something wrong?

56
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,120
You are the culprit

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,190
and you still want to find a scapegoat.

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,000
It hurts.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
If you hadn't insisted on me using the powder.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,190
Why would my face be like this?

61
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
Then why did you let me put on makeup for you?

62
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,360
That's because...

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
I know.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,800
It's because you want to make me happy.

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,590
Dear, you are so kind.

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,280
Do it yourself.

67
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,680
Song Jinghe.

68
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,310
Last time, I accidentally fell for your tricks.

69
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,430
This time.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,390
I'll beat you up.

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,070
Song Jinghe, are you crazy?

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,430
Blood?

73
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,720
Are you okay?

74
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,560
Bad news, this sword is poisonous.

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,040
Those who are hit by it will bleed to death.

76
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
Sooner or later, you'll be the death of me.

77
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,870
Give me the antidote.

78
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,360
Are you okay?

79
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,720
Dear, am I going to die?

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,390
Don't talk nonsense. Although I want to divorce you.

81
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,920
I won't just stand by and watch you die.

82
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,390
I will definitely save you.

83
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,310
Dear, I'm a little sleepy.

84
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,070
Su Qingmo, don't fall asleep.

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Wake up. I'll bandage you now.

86
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,360
Dear.

87
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,560
If I don't make it today,

88
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,240
will you feel sad for me?

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,950
Why are you being so indecisive?

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,750
I'm telling you, if I don't bandage you now,

91
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,160
you'll really die. Do you understand?

92
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,270
Dear.

93
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
I have one last wish.

94
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,560
Can you not divorce me?

95
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,190
Okay, okay. I won't divorce you.

96
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,070
Su Qingmo, Su Qingmo.

97
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,480
Someone come here!

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,600
Su Qingmo.

99
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,950
Wait.

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Lingxi, if you touch him,

101
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,720
it won't be easy to divorce him again.

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
I'll do it.

103
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,560
Get lost.

104
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,680
Where did the blood come from if there's no wound?

105
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,310
Blood sausage.

106
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
Blood sausage.

107
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,560
Dear.

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,600
This is the blood sausage that our neighbor just made.

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,870
Don't you like it?

110
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,310
I bought it specially for you.

111
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,510
How dare you lie to me?

112
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
Lingxi, he's a treacherous villain.

113
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Even that.

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,040
Prince Ning, who plays tricks every day,
is not as good as him.

115
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,510
If you ask me, just divorce him.

116
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,680
I'll count to three

117
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,630
and disappear from my sight immediately.

118
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,630
Three.

119
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,480
Although I'm not qualified

120
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,430
to be disciplined by Lingxi,

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,360
but just looking at you kneeling like this

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
is still very satisfying.

123
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,830
If it weren't for you just now

124
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,360
how would I have been discovered.

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,310
With your little bit of scheming,

126
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,040
even without me you would have been discovered anyway.

127
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,950
You still have reason.

128
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,390
Between my wife and me, that's called romance.

129
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
You're a rough man, what do you know.

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,510
Stop talking nonsense with me.

131
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm really puzzled.

132
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,510
Where on earth did you come from.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
Why did you two get married.

134
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,190
My wife and I were engaged as children.

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Of course we had to get married.

136
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,310
Then where have you been all this time?

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,510
You suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,630
That's because...

139
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,070
No, why am I telling you this?

140
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,310
You're my rival in love.

141
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,920
Go away.

142
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Fine, if you won't tell me.

143
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,800
Anyway, Su Qingmo,

144
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,240
we're not done yet.

145
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
Let me tell you something too.

146
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,390
My wife is not to be coveted by others.

147
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,630
We'll see about that.

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,390
What are you two whispering about over there?

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,800
Kneel down for me.

150
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,600
I don't have to kneel.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I wish Lingxi would scold me like that.

152
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,560
How's the investigation going?

153
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,240
We're getting close.

154
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,000
Once we have concrete evidence,

155
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,560
I'll send it to you right away.

156
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,800
Good.

157
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,720
Xi'er.

158
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Old man, why are you here?

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,150
Of course I'm here for something.

160
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
If it weren't for last night

161
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,360
when your husband beat me up.

162
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,670
I wouldn't have to come here again.

163
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,670
Old man, don't be angry.

164
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,630
He didn't do it on purpose.

165
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,870
Of course I know he didn't do it on purpose.

166
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,150
But you did it on purpose.

167
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,030
I heard you sent him to some kind of male virtue class.

168
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,030
Yes.

169
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,910
You girl, aren't you being ridiculous?

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,360
Old man, I've been practicing
martial arts since I was a child.

171
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,840
Now that I'm married,

172
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,390
someone has to take care of the household affairs.

173
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,670
Sending him to a male virtue class to learn

174
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,080
isn't that a good thing?

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,030
You're being unreasonable again.

176
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,240
Grandpa.

177
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,510
You don't want us to be at odds, do you?

178
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,200
Right?

179
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,550
Alright, alright.

180
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,670
Your marital affairs

181
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,870
I don't want to say much.

182
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,630
But you must remember.

183
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,750
Although he hasn't been granted an official title yet.

184
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,720
He's still a Tanhua.

185
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,840
You should give him some face.

186
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,550
Alright, alright, I understand

187
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,320
I promise you

188
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll bully him less in the future.

189
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,790
That's right.

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,320
Miss, the Crown Prince is here.

191
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,510
The Crown Prince? Why is he here?

192
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,270
Go and see him.

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,030
I was unaware of your arrival, Your Highness.

194
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,120
I hope Your Highness will forgive me.

195
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,790
It's no matter.

196
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
I have come to deliver a decree from the Emperor.

197
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,270
There is a decree?

198
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,630
It is not for you, but for Lord Su.

199
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,240
Lord Su has passed the imperial examination.

200
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,750
But he has yet to be appointed to an official position.

201
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,550
Today, the Emperor has decreed

202
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,550
that he be appointed to the Ministry of Rites.

203
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

204
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,670
The Emperor has decreed today

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,910
that you be appointed as
Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,120
I thank Your Majesty for his grace.

207
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,910
It is a pity.

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,510
When the Emperor granted me a marriage,

209
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,480
if General Mu's hadn't said a word

210
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,550
that the two of you were already betrothed.

211
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,270
I imagine today, General Mu

212
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
would have been my Crown Princess.
