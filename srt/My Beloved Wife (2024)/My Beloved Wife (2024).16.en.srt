1
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,760
Just now, the Emperor issued an imperial decree.

3
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 16

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,030
Saying that General Mu is guilty of corruption and treason.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,510
In consideration of the Mu family's military achievements,

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,390
He will spare your life.

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,110
Just now...

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,150
What about before that?

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,920
You clearly know martial arts.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,350
Why have you been lying to me all this time?

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,520
Su Qingmo,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,430
Who are you really?

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
Lingxi, you have to believe me.

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,390
No matter who I am,

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
I've always been sincere to you.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
Sincere to me?

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,510
We've been married for so long,

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,920
but you still won't tell me your true identity.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,710
Am I your wife,

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,950
or just a tool you're using?

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
I married you because I love you,

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,040
and I've never used you.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
Lingxi,

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,200
please believe me.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,230
Believe you?

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,790
You're full of lies.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,840
How do I know if your next word is true

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,070
or false?

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,400
How can we trust each other anymore?

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,040
I did hide the fact that I am Wuyin.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
But I did it to protect you.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,950
Protect me?

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,710
You protected me so well that I was seriously injured.

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,950
You protected me so well that my family was ruined.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
You protected me so well that my grandfather

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,590
was accused of treason and corruption.

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,030
and died unjustly?

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,630
Su Qingmo,

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
what secrets are you hiding?

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
It even cost my grandfather his life,

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,400
you still refuse to tell me?

42
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,750
Lingxi, I really didn't know that my grandfather would.

43
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,240
Stop talking.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,150
I don't want to hear it. Get out of here.

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
Get out!

46
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,520
That's all of them.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
The most important one has not been collected yet.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,750
But Your Majesty,

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,030
we can't wait any longer.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,710
We must close the net.

51
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,840
You always prepare everything before you act.

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,800
This matter has not been investigated clearly yet.

53
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,190
You are ready to close the net.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's not like your usual style of doing things.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,710
Is it because of.

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,870
Mu Lingxi?

57
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,120
I dare not conceal it.

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,680
But I really don't want Lingxi

59
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,150
to be hurt again.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,750
You have a long way ahead of you.

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,430
The future of Xi Kingdom needs you too.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,000
You can't let these personal feelings

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,360
disrupt your plans.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
I need you to continue to investigate clearly.

65
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,710
As long as this matter is done well,

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,360
I will not treat you badly.

67
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,630
Your Majesty,

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
what I want is not these.

69
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,840
I just want Lingxi to be safe and sound.

70
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,630
Do you want to resist the imperial decree?

71
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
I dare not.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,430
But I think

73
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,630
the crown prince will definitely take action recently.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,560
Your Majesty, for your safety,

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,750
we should also take action.

76
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,910
What do you want to do?

77
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,680
Young Master

78
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,040
everything has been arranged.

79
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
The manor used to be so lively.

80
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,600
Now Old General Mu has been accused of treason.

81
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,270
After his death, no one came to pay their respects.

82
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
Officialdom is heartless.

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,000
The warmth and coldness of people's hearts

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,430
for the eyes to see.

85
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,070
Young Master.

86
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,190
You've done your best.

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,630
You go first.

88
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Yes.

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,430
Why is Lord Su still here?

90
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,870
Lingxi.

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,070
You've been asleep for two days.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've already taken care of Grandfather's funeral.

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,750
You don't have to worry.

94
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,600
I don't need your false concern.

95
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,040
Your career is more important.

96
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,720
Please leave, Lord Su.

97
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Lingxi.

98
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,160
I'm your husband.

99
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,240
Please believe me.

100
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I really want to kill you.

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
But I'm afraid of dirtying the Mu family's place.

102
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,000
Su Qingmo.

103
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,680
I hate it most when people lie to me.

104
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,270
Under the pretense of doing what's best for me

105
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,720
and keeping me in the dark.

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,920
I don't care what you're planning behind my back.

107
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,040
Now that I've lost Grandfather.

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
I just want to pass on the Mu family army properly.

109
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,630
Don't bother me anymore.

110
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,630
Let's

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,310
get a divorce.

112
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Okay.

113
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,480
Young Master.

114
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,000
How can you be so cruel?

115
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,830
What will happen to the general if you leave?

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,040
She just lost her grandfather and her child.

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
You can't leave.

118
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,510
She still has Prince Ning and Song Jinghe to rely on.

119
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,040
She and I are only bound by a marriage contract

120
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,430
I'll give you half an incense stick's time to pack.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Otherwise,

122
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,120
you won't be following me anymore.

123
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,600
Young Master.

124
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,510
Go quickly.

125
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,870
Duoduo.

126
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,480
You're back.

127
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,240
Brother Lixiao.

128
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,910
Brother Lixiao, please, I beg you to save my cousin.

129
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,670
The Mu family would never embezzle.

130
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,670
Grandpa Mu.

131
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,790
Grandpa Mu would never collude with the enemy.

132
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,870
There must be some misunderstanding.

133
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,150
Duoduo, don't worry

134
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm already aware of this matter.

135
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Everyone is avoiding the Mu family now.

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,440
They can't wait to stay far away from them.

137
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,150
Only you are willing to speak up for them.

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,360
My cousin and I grew up together.

139
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,360
Grandpa Mu.

140
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,840
Grandpa Mu treats me like his own granddaughter.

141
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,270
I believe them.

142
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
They would never do such a thing.

143
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,870
Brother Lixiao.

144
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,510
Now, only you can help her.

145
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,270
Su Qingmo was really kicked out.

146
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,870
He was really kicked out.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They signed the divorce papers.

148
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,030
I don't think they will reconcile.

149
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
You did a good job with this matter.

150
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,000
Go.

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,750
Thank you, Your Highness.
