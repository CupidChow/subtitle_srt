1
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 19

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,000
Mu Lingxi, you will be mine in the end.

4
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,030
Leader Song, how have you been doing?

5
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,840
Why are you here?

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,390
You don't think my wife and I have something

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,790
going on between us?

8
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,030
Dear.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,560
Dear.

10
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,840
I've come to take you home.

11
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,000
Why did you only come now?

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,840
I thought you wouldn't come.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,680
Su Qingmo.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,510
You are such a liar.

15
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,920
I'm here now, aren't I.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,400
Come on, let's go home.

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,640
Do you know who I am?

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Just ask around.

19
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,960
I could kill you at any minute.

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,080
Don't go.

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,680
Come back and untie me!

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Su Qingmo, you bastard!

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,310
Su Qingmo,

24
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,605
you bastard!

25
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,680
I'll kill you!

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,360
It's healed now.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,960
Compared to the pain you caused me,

28
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,590
It makes me more upset to see you

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,870
destroy the perfume satchel I gave you.

30
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,030
You promised me before that you would

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,750
make things real.

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,630
At the very least,

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,400
you could make a new one for me.

34
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,960
Good.

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,710
You've seized the chance

36
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,150
to exploit me again.

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,710
Would you do it or not?

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
How would I dare not listen

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
to my wife?

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,030
By the way,

41
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,800
don't use He Li as bait again.

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,310
I was really scared that day.

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
I want to hear your explanation.

44
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,630
Grandfaher's death is related to the Crown Prince.

45
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,520
He wants to take over the Mu family army.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Only when we are separated,

47
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,120
will he carry out his last plan.

48
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,470
Who are you?

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm Su Qingmo.

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,120
Shadowless is just a name in the underworld.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,750
After becoming a Tanhua,

52
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,430
I was summoned by His Majesty.

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
To investigate the Crown Prince's dirty deeds in secret

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,030
and collected evidence in secret.

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,120
He was actually engaged to marry you.

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,430
I fell in love with you at first sight

57
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,750
when I saved you.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,120
Lingxi, please believe me.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,430
I have never lied to you.

60
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,710
What about my grandfather?

61
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
When my grandfather passed away,

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,480
why didn't you save him?

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,120
That day, when I received news

64
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,510
that the Crown Prince had sent
his suicide warriors.

65
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,310
I realized something was amiss so I rushed to save you.

66
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
But I did not expect

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,680
he would frame Old General Mu.

68
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,950
We have known each other since we were children.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,830
I did not expect him to be so vicious.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
Me either.

71
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,000
To avoid arousing suspicion,

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,390
he even killed his Crown Princess.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,800
It is difficult to see through a vicious men.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,000
Su Qingmo.

75
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,160
Can I really believe

76
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,190
what you're saying?

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
This letter was personally written by grandfather.

78
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,870
If you don't trust me,

79
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,430
you should trust your grandfather.

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Xi'er, when you see this letter,

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,240
grandpa might have passed away.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,560
I was helpless when I forced you

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
to marry Qingmo.

84
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,830
If I didn't do that,

85
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,120
more people would be coveting the Mu family army.

86
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,680
Qingmo, he's a good boy.

87
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,310
You must believe him.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,310
He is the Shadowless who saved you back then

89
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,120
and he won't let you suffer.

90
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,830
The little rocking wooden horse

91
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,750
just let Qingmo finish it.

92
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,600
Let my great-grandson

93
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,950
ride it.

94
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,510
Xi'er.

95
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,720
You'll always be my good granddaughter.

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,950
I hope you can be happy forever.

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,190
Grandfather knew he was in danger,

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,560
he also knew that I would vent my anger on you.

99
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,390
But he still persuaded me to believe you.

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,360
Lingxi,

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
can you trust me now?

102
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,070
I knocked down the spies

103
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,630
in the Crown Prince's residence.

104
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,270
There are spies lurking around the courtyard.

105
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,240
I must return before they wake up.

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,390
When we return,

107
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,070
I will devise a plan to apprehend the Crown Prince.

108
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,480
He will find a way to take you as his bride.

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,270
You must marry him

110
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,750
and find a way to meet with me.

111
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,800
And then?

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,630
And then...

113
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,390
Tell me.

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,190
Sever my tendons

115
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,600
in front of the Crown Prince.

116
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,920
Sever your tendons?

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,070
Don't worry.

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,240
It's just an act.

119
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,750
I've made an arrangement with the imperial physician

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,000
to conceal it from the Crown Prince.

121
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,190
Don't worry.

122
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,270
I will carry out your plan,

123
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,240
and avenge grandfather with you.

124
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,120
Lingxi, it's time for me to return.

125
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,510
Lingxi,

126
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,270
I love you.

127
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,800
I love you too.

128
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,750
How is it, Lord Su?

129
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,390
I did a good job, didn't I?

130
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,160
We're husband and wife.

131
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,390
Our tacit understanding is unmatched.

132
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,240
What's the matter?

133
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,150
That...

134
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,960
Young Master, General.

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,440
Please go on.

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I'll talk to you later.

137
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
Tell us, what's wrong?

138
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,390
I could not find Prince Ning.

139
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,750
But I got news about the Crown Prince's movement.

140
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Tell us.

141
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,120
Most of the imperial guards have been sent away.

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,150
His Majesty might be in danger.

143
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,870
I've been waiting for this moment.

144
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,510
Lingxi, let's save His Majesty together.

145
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,270
Whoever stands in your way, charge!

146
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,510
Charge!

147
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,240
Crown Prince, how dare you
bring a sword into the imperial study?

148
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,200
So what?

149
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,150
Eunuch Xu,

150
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,320
It's okay.

151
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,910
Crown Prince,

152
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,320
you came at the right time.

153
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
Have a seat.

154
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,360
You brought the Mu family army here.

155
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,480
With their support,

156
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,870
what are you afraid of?

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Father,

158
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,550
I don't need to do these.

159
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,870
You forced me to do it.

160
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,600
I forced you?

161
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,320
You're already the Crown Prince.

162
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,600
What more do you want?

163
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm the Crown Prince,

164
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,390
but the power to manage the country

165
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,240
is in his hands.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,440
Everything I've done in the past

167
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,720
has been to make his wedding clothes.

168
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,270
In terms of ability and power,

169
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,320
how am I not comparable to him?

170
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,720
Why did you have to

171
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,480
give it to a useless man like him?

172
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Why should I?

173
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
Why? Don't you know?

174
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,360
The flood in the south.

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,120
Prince Ning sold his properties to help the victims.

176
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,750
You?

177
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,440
You put your hope in the Mo family,

178
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
and nothing was achieved.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,080
You are selfish, extreme and reckless.

180
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,080
How can I rest assured

181
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,200
and leave a nation to you.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,550
Father.

183
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,630
As long as you're dead,

184
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,870
with or without the imperial edict,

185
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,750
I'm the emperor.
