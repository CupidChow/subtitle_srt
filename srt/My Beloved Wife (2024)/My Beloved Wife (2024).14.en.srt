1
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,230
Let me in.

3
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 14

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,870
Without the Crown Prince's permission,

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,440
I dare not let you in.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,440
Let me in!

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,230
This...

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,960
Let him in.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,600
Yes.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,280
You drugged Mo Shaokuan.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,670
Yes, I drugged him.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,790
But the drug wasn't meant for him.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,880
He was careless.

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,430
Who did you intend to drug?

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,710
Su Qingmo?

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,920
If Su Qingmo really left with the Emperor,

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,000
You could marry Mu Lingxi.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,110
It would be a win-win situation.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
I did it for your own good.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,600
For my own good?

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,150
I would never do such a

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,600
despicable and filthy thing.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,320
How dare you!

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,200
I am your elder brother,

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,880
and the Crown Prince.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,590
How dare you speak to me like that?

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,120
You are now the Crown Prince.

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,070
What more do you want?

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
The world will be yours one day.

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,590
Isn't that enough for you?

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,040
You still know that I am the Crown Prince.

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
Whether it's the flood in the south

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,510
or other matters.

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,560
Father has entrusted everything to you.

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,200
and I can only be like a puppet

36
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,760
manipulated by him.

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,680
And you...

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,480
You're just a prince born of a concubine.

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,280
How dare you lord over me?

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,430
Your Highness,

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,680
you finally speak your mind.

42
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,000
Why won't Father let you do it,

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,430
don't you know the reason?

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,310
Let me tell you,

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,920
I don't want to be the Crown Prince

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,310
and I don't want it either.

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,590
But Lingxi and the others are my friends.

48
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,400
If anyone dares to hurt them,

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,400
I'll make sure they pay.

50
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,310
Your Highness.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Everything is ready?

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,680
Everything is ready.

53
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,870
We can start tonight.

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,910
Very good.

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,910
If you do this well.

56
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,840
I will naturally get what I want.

57
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,470
If you mess it up.

58
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,030
You know what to do.

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,750
I will definitely find a place

60
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,150
far away from the capital to die.

61
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,360
And I will definitely not cause trouble for Your Highness.

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,960
Very good. Go.

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,080
Yes.

64
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
Duoduo.

65
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,590
Brother Lixiao.

66
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,120
I'm leaving.

67
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,710
This is the last thing I can give you.

68
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,240
The last thing.

69
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,190
Duoduo.

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,470
You don't have to say it

71
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,680
I know everything.

72
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,190
Brother Lixiao,

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,310
you don't like me.

74
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,840
But you must accept this

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,560
I made it myself.

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,960
And after I go back this time.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,470
My mother will talk to me about marriage.

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
In the future.

79
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,310
I will never bother you again.

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,710
Actually, I...

81
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,710
I know.

82
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,280
I know.

83
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,470
It's because I'm not good enough now.

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,590
I hope.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,240
My Brother Lixiao

86
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,910
can find someone you love and who loves you.

87
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,560
May you live happily ever after.

88
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,070
Dear.

89
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,430
The Crown Prince has invited me and
the Crown Princess to go on an outing.

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,270
He said it was to make up for his rudeness the other day.

91
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,630
Do you want to go?

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,510
It's better to go out and relax
than to stay cooped up at home.

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,390
Ever since I got pregnant

94
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,950
they won't even let me go to the military camp anymore.

95
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm starting to get moldy.

96
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,070
Then I'll go pack your things.

97
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,070
Really?

98
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,120
Thank you, dear

99
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,360
I'll be gone for several days

100
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
I should tell grandpa.

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Otherwise he'll worry.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,870
Cousin.

103
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,560
Duoduo, why are you here?

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,310
I've come to say goodbye

105
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm going home.

106
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,240
Okay

107
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm going out to play for a few days.

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,950
You're going home so I don't have to worry about you.

109
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,240
Let's go see grandpa.

110
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,750
Go.

111
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,630
It's so beautiful.

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,270
In the future, I'll let my great-grandson

113
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,510
sit on it and ride a big horse.

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,270
I'll watch from the side

115
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,390
drinking a little wine.

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
It's so beautiful no matter how I think about it.

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Old man,

118
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,870
why did you call me here?

119
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,560
Come here quickly.

120
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,680
Look at this horse I made. How is it?

121
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,480
Your craftsmanship hasn't changed at all.

122
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,430
Of course not.

123
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,920
Cousin, you're so lucky.

124
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Grandpa Mu, I want one too.

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,430
Look at this girl.

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
Sure, of course you can.

127
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,950
When you get married and have children in the future,

128
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,480
Grandpa will make one for you too.

129
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,750
Thank you, Grandpa Mu.

130
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,270
Then I must marry a good husband.

131
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,390
Old man

132
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,950
I remember the wooden sword I had when I was a child,

133
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,270
you made them all for me.

134
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,430
Why are you making a rocking horse now?

135
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,630
What's wrong with a rocking horse?

136
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,750
Do you think

137
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
all children are like you?

138
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
So fond of playing with swords and spears?

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,310
Don't be in such a hurry.

140
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,360
Wait until I put the saddle on.

141
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,720
After it's finished.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,430
You can try it out too.

143
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,360
Okay, I'll wait for you.

144
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,310
You're still so clumsy.

145
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,750
Why can't you change?

146
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,310
You're going to be a mother soon

147
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,560
and you're still so childish.

148
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,480
Hold it back.

149
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,720
Don't cry.

150
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,600
Remember what I said.

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,920
No matter what happens in the future,

152
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,000
you can't cry.

153
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Fine, I'll bear with it.

154
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh, right, Grandpa,

155
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm going out to play for two days.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,920
Be good and wait for me to come back, okay?

157
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,630
Okay, just go.

158
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,870
Don't bother me here.

159
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,950
Then you must take good care of yourself.

160
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,190
Don't make me worry.

161
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,680
Then I'm leaving.

162
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,950
Go, go.

163
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,510
Don't bother me here.

164
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm really leaving?

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,270
Okay, hurry up.

166
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,680
Grandpa Mu, I'm leaving too.

167
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,270
I'm leaving.

168
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,390
Young Master, the Crown Prince is about to make his move.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,670
He can't sit still any longer.

170
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,670
Young Master,

171
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,390
what should we do next?

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,550
We must keep a close eye on him,

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,870
and not give him a chance to act.

174
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,910
The storm is coming.

175
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,790
The capital is about to change.

176
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,080
What did you wish for?

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,240
To be together forever.

178
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,320
What about the child?

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,790
The children will have their own fortune.

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
What will happen to them in the future?

181
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,150
It won't come true just because you wish for it.

182
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Right now, I just want to be
with my husband for a long time.

183
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,200
Ah Xue, protect the Crown Princess.

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,910
Miss.
