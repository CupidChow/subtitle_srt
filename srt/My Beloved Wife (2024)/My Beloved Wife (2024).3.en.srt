00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 3

3
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,320
Dear, you're a little loli fox demon!

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,350
Who's a loli?

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,030
You're the loli!

6
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,590
Give me back my first kiss.

7
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,950
Are you savoring it?

8
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,710
I'll beat you!

9
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,040
Stop right there.

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,870
Don't chase me, dear.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,510
I'll kill you.

12
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,920
Stop.

13
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,120
Young Master.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,760
Stop.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,280
Miss.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Don't chase me, dear.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,870
Miss.

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,070
Run?

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Miss.

20
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,510
Keep Runing!

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,310
Miss.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,310
Let's see how many more laps you want to run.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,640
Why aren't you running anymore?

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,350
I can't do it anymore

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,040
I can't do it anymore, wife.

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,480
I can't run anymore.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,560
You look so gentle and quiet.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,280
But you have more stamina than me.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,200
It's my survival instinct that's driving me.

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,230
Wife, you've been chasing me for so long.

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,000
Aren't you tired?

32
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,560
I'll cook something for you to eat.

33
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,230
How can you be so shameless?

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,840
I've treated you like this.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
And you want me to cook for you?

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,310
Ah Wen, hurry up.

37
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
Miss must be hungry after running all night

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,910
I'll stew a big pig's trotter for her for breakfast.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,910
Hurry up, hurry up.

40
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes, Young Master.

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,190
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Slow down!

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
I'll get you sooner or later!

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,280
Slow down, Young Master!

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
Miss, why do you insist on driving the Young Master away?

46
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,710
I think the Young Master is quite good.

47
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,080
He's three years younger than me.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,520
He's as weak as a chicken.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,150
I'm a great general.

50
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,750
How can I be with someone like him?

51
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,750
The most important thing is

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,870
we don't have any feelings for each other.

53
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,030
But, Miss.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Divorce letter, martial arts competition...

55
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,960
You've even tried pretending to be a monster.

56
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,960
What other tricks do you have up your sleeve?

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Of course, it's to send him to a good place.

58
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:56,935
[Male Virtue Class]

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,680
If you want me to not divorce you, you can.

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,960
First, go to the male virtue class and study.

61
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,680
If you pass, I'll consider keeping you.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,750
You really are my good wife.

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,030
Su Qingmo.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,680
Here is 500 taels of silver.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,280
Leave Lingxi.

66
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,680
Young Master Mo wants to use such despicable means

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,960
to force me to leave Lingxi.

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,000
You are really rich and powerful.

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,030
You change your move, I'll follow.

70
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,680
You said it yourself.

71
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,430
Don't regret it.

72
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,000
Thank you, Shopkeeper Mo.

73
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,680
Your craftsmanship is excellent.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,030
The chicken wings are all broken.

75
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,800
This is a phoenix!

76
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,120
Phoenix!

77
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,190
Mu Lingxi, come out.

78
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,190
Mu Lingxi.

79
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,240
You three, stop shouting.

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,720
Miss has heard everything.

81
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,040
Xi Xi.

82
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,430
Xi Xi, I want to ask you.

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,160
Why did you suddenly think of

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,920
sending that Su Qingmo to a male virtue class?

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,630
He's never studied male virtue

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
I'll send him to learn.

87
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,000
He's never studied male virtue.

88
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,430
Isn't that a coincidence?

89
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,600
I happen to know the best male
virtue teacher in the Southern Kingdom

90
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,870
in the best male virtue class.

91
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,630
Why don't I use my connections to get him.

92
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,920
You!

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dear.

94
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,920
He can't compete, so he wants to play dirty.

95
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,000
How can this be called playing dirty?

96
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm doing this entirely for Xi Xi's sake.

97
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,510
If you're not convinced

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,510
why don't we have another competition?

99
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,750
Let's compete.

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,750
No matter how you compete, 
you're just a grasshopper in autumn

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
I'll be ready whenever you are.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,270
You said it yourself.

103
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,720
Su Qingmo, Su Qingmo.

104
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,160
A gentleman's word is his bond.

105
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,750
We men must keep our word.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Did I say that?

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,120
How could I have forgotten?

108
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,600
Let's talk this out. Don't resort to violence.

109
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,270
If you want to compete, then let's compete.
What do you suggest?

110
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,240
Of course, we three brothers will decide what we compete in.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Then let's meet tomorrow.

112
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:57,190
Good luck.

113
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,160
Good luck, Prince Ning.

114
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,630
Young Master is the strongest! Go Young Master!
Young Master is the best!

115
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,630
I declare

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,630
the competition now officially

117
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,830
begins!

118
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,630
Miss, do you think they can do it?

119
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,920
Who cares if they can do it or not?

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,310
Just watch it for fun.

121
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,480
Look at our number one contestant, Su Qingmo.

122
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,630
His hands are flying fast.

123
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,600
He's rubbing the clothes in his hands slowly and steadily.

124
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,360
What is he doing?

125
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,360
He's using the long-lost "good son-in-law" rubbing method.

126
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,240
Clothes washed with this method

127
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,920
will be as clear as new and have a natural fragrance.

128
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,830
It seems that our number four contestant, Song Jinghe,

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,480
is not performing well.

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,390
I'm not washing anymore.

131
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,190
Why are we competing in washing clothes?

132
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,950
If we were competing in killing, I would have won long ago.

133
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,480
One contestant has already

134
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,270
chosen to withdraw due to pressure.

135
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,430
Now the competition has reached a stalemate.

136
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,800
Come on, Brother Lixiao!

137
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,360
Brother Lixiao is the best!

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,040
What's going on with you?

139
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
Su Qingmo has already started.

140
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,270
His third piece of clothing.

141
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Prince Ning is also hot on his heels.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,950
They both picked up the fourth
piece of clothing at the same time.

143
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,750
It seems that Young Master Mo needs to hurry up.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,630
He doesn't have much time left.

145
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,040
Let's see if he can break out of the encirclement.

146
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,950
Three.

147
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,560
Two.

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
One.

149
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,240
Time's up.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,390
Now, let's invite General Mu

151
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,680
to come up and inspect the
quality of the clothes they washed.

152
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,630
Xi Xi.

153
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
Such a big hole.

154
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,630
You're out.

155
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,950
Young Master Mo is the strongest!

156
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,310
Young Master Su wins!

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,430
I, the general, announce.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,240
The winner of this competition is.

159
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,390
It's a tie.

160
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,270
How can it be a tie?

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,070
Brother Lixiao.

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
What's wrong, cousin?

163
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,510
I, I want to tell you.

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,870
It's just a competition.

165
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,950
You don't have to be discouraged.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,680
Thank you

167
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,830
I will definitely work hard.

168
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,750
Go for it.

169
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,240
Come on!

170
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,510
How come he's like a cockroach?

171
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,910
He just won't die!

172
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,670
Miss, why don't you just let the Young Master go?

173
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,150
I think the Young Master is pretty good.

174
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,030
Why are you taking his side?

175
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,150
You're my person.

176
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,510
You can't speak up for him.

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,960
Forget it. Whatever.

178
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,750
I'll think of something else.

179
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
I don't believe he's that powerful.

180
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,600
Where's Duoduo?

181
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,840
I don't know where the Miss went.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,550
I haven't seen her since earlier.

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
Whatever. Let's go.

184
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,670
Duoduo, why did you call me here?

185
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,910
I...

186
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,000
I like you.

187
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,670
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,870
I can't accept your feelings.

189
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,320
It's okay.

190
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,910
It's my business to like you.

191
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,870
If you don't like me,

192
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,550
It's your business.

193
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,150
I've said my piece.

194
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,840
I can't control who you like.

195
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
If you could...

196
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,630
I'll be happy if you could say it.

197
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,550
Thank you, Duoduo.

198
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,630
Actually, I've always liked Lingxi since I was a child.

199
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,960
It's just that because of my sensitive identity,

200
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,750
I was afraid that the court would speculate,

201
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,390
I hope to use the military power of the Mu family

202
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,030
to compete with the Crown Prince for the throne.

203
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,600
That's why I never confessed.

204
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,240
Since you've hidden it for so long,

205
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,270
why did you show favor to my sister

206
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,750
to ruin her marriage?

207
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,150
Because she doesn't love him.

208
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,960
Their marriage is

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,510
a marriage arranged by their parents and a matchmaker.

210
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,600
Compared to Lingxi's happiness,

211
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
now it seems that

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
nothing else matters.

213
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,080
What if

214
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,870
what if she also has feelings for me?

215
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,870
I understand.

216
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
Then,

217
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,670
then I wish you all the best.

218
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,080
Why do you think they're bad

219
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,080
at washing clothes?

220
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,910
That's because they don't know,

221
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,270
Master has been trying to help you

222
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,720
become a good husband.

223
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,480
He's tried every method of washing clothes.

224
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,750
And he's taught you himself.

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,750
How could you possibly lose to them?

226
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,630
But why did you say

227
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,840
that we're tied?

228
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,870
The general probably didn't want you to seem too good.

229
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,120
So that you wouldn't attract hatred.

230
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,270
So you're saying.

231
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
That you were doing it for my own good?

232
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,670
Yes, that's right.

233
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,440
Dear.

234
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,080
Come, careful.

235
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,790
My dear, did I do well today?

236
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,910
None of those three could beat me in any round.

237
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,150
They probably won't bother you again.

238
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,480
I remember the only copy of the
Good Husband's Rubbing Method

239
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
has been lost for a long time.

240
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,600
Where did you learn it from?

241
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,910
My dear,

242
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,790
how could I know the Good Husband's Rubbing Method?

243
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,600
The method is not important.

244
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,510
It's my feelings for you.

245
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,750
Can you be any more greasy?

246
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,200
If you like it,

247
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,630
I can be greasier than lard.
