1
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 18

3
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,390
You can do whatever you want.

4
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,880
So it really was you.

5
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,840
You caused my grandfather to be accused of

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
treason and corruption.

7
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,400
Su Qingmo,

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,350
my grandfather treated you so well.

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,680
How could you bear to treat him like this?

10
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,590
I was almost fooled by you.

11
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,840
I thought you were the one who loved me the most.

12
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,430
I was like an idiot,

13
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,920
and I fell for you.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Only to find out in the end

15
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,430
that you were the biggest liar

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,350
and the most terrifying person.

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
My heart aches.

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
When you harmed my grandfather,

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,000
why didn't you think about whether my heart would ache?

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,870
Su Qingmo,

21
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,800
don't think I'll let you off so easily.

22
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,680
Even if I cut off your tendons and hamstrings,

23
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,520
it wouldn't make up for the harm
you've done to my grandfather.

24
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,120
Your Highness

25
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,120
I've done what I wanted to do.

26
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,120
After the seventh day after Grandfather's death.

27
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,710
We'll get married.

28
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,360
As you wish.

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,150
Guards.

30
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,630
Yes.

31
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,190
Escort General Mu back to his residence.

32
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,960
Yes.

33
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,590
Find a physician.

34
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,840
Check his tendons

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,190
if they're really severed.

36
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,560
Yes.

37
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,190
Your Highness.

38
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
This is...

39
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,750
What should I be afraid of?

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,830
It'll be mine sooner or later.

41
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,270
Everything is settled?

42
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560
It's settled.

43
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,360
I guarantee it won't ruin your plans.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,430
Very good.

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,190
If it weren't for Su Qingmo

46
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,120
I wouldn't have to go through all this trouble.

47
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,240
Maybe it's a good thing Mu Lingxi didn't die.

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
After all, she's been in the army for many years

49
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,120
and she's still popular with the army.

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,360
And Prince Ning...

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,270
No need to say more.

52
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,920
My brother,

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,680
as a prince

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,920
spends his days idling

55
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,920
with his mind set on Mu Lingxi.

56
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,950
The funny thing is

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,680
father still thinks of passing the throne to him.

58
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,240
How can I not resent him.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,270
If Su Qingmo doesn't die.

60
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,920
Will Mu Lingxi really marry you

61
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,270
Su Qingmo's tendons

62
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,430
were severed by Mu Lingxi herself.

63
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,070
What do you think?

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,510
Is there anything else I need to do now?

65
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,270
In three days,

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,000
lead your men

67
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,920
and lie in ambush around the palace.

68
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Wait for the right moment to strike.

69
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,240
What Your Highness said,

70
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,830
is it still valid?

71
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,190
Of course it's still valid.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
When I ascend to the throne.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,040
I will hand over the Mu family army to you.

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,950
Good.

75
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,000
I will wait for the day when
Your Highness fulfills your promise.

76
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,120
Farewell.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Miss.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,390
Are you really going to marry the Crown Prince?

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,190
Of course.

80
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,190
My grandfather and I were wrong to trust Su Qingmo before.

81
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,560
We can't make the same mistake again.

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,430
The Mu family army is my grandfather's life's work.

83
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,560
Only the Crown Prince can help
me protect the Mu family army.

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
This wedding dress is still so beautiful.

85
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,310
It's just that my state of mind

86
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,000
is not the same as before.

87
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,190
Miss,

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,920
since you have chosen to let go of the past,

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
then forget it all.

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,750
You have me to accompany you.

91
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,190
We must live our lives well from now on.

92
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,750
It's good to have you.

93
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,720
General Mu,

94
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,120
the sedan chair to take you to the palace has arrived.

95
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,390
Please move to the sedan chair.

96
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,240
Let's go.

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,390
Lingxi is in mourning,

98
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,070
and cannot wear the wedding dress.

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,070
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

100
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,240
It's fine.

101
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,270
Lingxi,

102
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,040
let us drink this cup of wine together.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,870
The Mu family army will now belong to Your Highness.

104
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,390
I beg Your Highness to protect the Mu family.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,950
Xi'er, don't worry.

106
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
I will definitely protect you in the future.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,270
Protect the Mu family.

108
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,080
I've knocked her out for you.

109
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,910
Be discreet.

110
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,030
Don't let anyone outside hear.

111
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

112
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,670
Mu Lingxi, you will be mine in the end.
