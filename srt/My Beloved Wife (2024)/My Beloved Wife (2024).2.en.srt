1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 2

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,350
When the time is right.

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,000
She will definitely...

5
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,070
Divorce you!

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,960
Young master.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,350
Grandpa promised to give me the Qingyue Sword.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,830
Only then would I be willing to marry you.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,510
Now that I have the sword.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,430
There is no need for our marriage to continue.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,840
This is the divorce paper.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,350
Will you walk back by yourself.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,390
Or should I send someone

14
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,150
to carry you back in a sedan chair.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,880
No.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,790
Dear, we just got married

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,880
and you want to divorce me.

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,200
What did I do wrong?

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,430
Listen up, little brother.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,520
I only stay with people I like.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,840
Although you look...

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,280
somewhat handsome

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
and somewhat talented.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,110
But our marriage

25
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,150
was just a matter of parental orders and obligation.

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,240
Now that the obligation is fulfilled,

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,560
What reason is there for us to stay together?

28
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,470
I...

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,920
I refuse to accept this.

30
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,480
According to the laws of our Xi kingdom,

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,430
After a man and woman are married,
without a reasonable cause,

32
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,840
one party may not abandon the other without cause.

33
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,840
Educated people are just so troublesome.

34
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,790
My marriage,

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,150
must be decided by me.

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,350
I only stay with people who are stronger than me.

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,150
Actually, I'm pretty strong too.

38
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,200
Right.

39
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,870
So you're saying

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
she's bringing a group of people to the capital.

41
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,950
That's right, young master.

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,430
Although we don't know what they're up to.

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
This group of people is very secretive.

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,510
If our people

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,790
hadn't noticed something was wrong when they set off

46
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,350
I'm afraid.

47
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,000
It would have been difficult to find out about this.

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,070
Keep a close eye on that group.

49
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,430
If there's an emergency

50
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,000
you can come straight to the manor and find me.

51
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,840
Yes, young master.

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,470
Dear, do you love me?

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,430
Song Jinghe, you're asking for a beating.

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,590
Mu Lingxi.

55
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,360
I've been chasing you all over the world for three years.

56
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,080
I can't believe you married someone

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
weak and useless pretty boy.

58
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm the leader of the Qinghe Gang.

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,680
How am I not better than him?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,680
It's marrying, not marrying off.

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,710
Besides,

62
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,470
What does my marriage have to do with you?

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,150
Did I not beat you hard enough?

64
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,470
Since it was arranged by our parents and a matchmaker,

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,400
I don't believe there's any real love between you.

66
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,680
Today I'm here to challenge...

67
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,910
Him!

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
If you lose,

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,030
leave Lingxi obediently

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,120
and let me marry her.

71
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,520
At that time,

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,080
the entire Qinghe Gang will be my dowry.

73
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,710
You're so blatant about stealing my wife.

74
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,710
Your face must be made of city walls.

75
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,190
To me,

76
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,310
you're the one who stole my wife.

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
What right do you have to accuse me?

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,030
I...

79
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,030
will give you a chance.

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
If you win,

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,630
I will seriously consider your proposal.

82
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,120
Little brother, if you lose.

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,750
It will be a disgrace to my Mu family

84
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,840
I can divorce you with good reason.

85
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,030
Let the match begin.

86
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,910
Wait a minute.

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,150
Leader Song.

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,870
It's the Mu family's rule to treat guests with hospitality.

89
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,280
Why don't we sit down and have some tea before we fight?

90
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:51,870
Dear.

91
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,630
This is made from the spring tea
that I personally picked and brewed.

92
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,680
Try it.

93
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,630
It's awful

94
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,560
I will give Mu Lingxi whatever she wants.

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,310
You don't need to show off here.

96
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,240
What's wrong? Are you okay?

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,270
You!

98
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,310
You poisoned me.

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
What are you talking about, Leader Song?

100
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm just a scholar.

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
Where would I find poison?

102
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,560
Dear has been feeling a bit hot-tempered lately.

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
So I added some mint leaves to her tea.

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,040
To cool her down

105
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,360
I didn't expect you to snatch it and drink it.

106
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,950
The mighty Leader Song.

107
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,040
Is actually so weak.

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,510
How pitiful.

109
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,510
Just you wait.

110
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,630
We'll meet again.

111
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,830
Stop crying.

112
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,120
Wait.

113
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,560
The Mu family residence

114
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,070
is not a place you can just barge into.

115
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,630
If you dare to do it again, I'll break your legs.

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,390
Leave.

117
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,800
Dear, I won.

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,040
Are you not going to divorce me?

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,800
You did well.

120
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm sleepy. Let's talk tomorrow.

121
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,430
I was too yesterday.

122
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,830
If you dare to mention last night again,

123
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,120
I'll cut off your tongue.

124
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,870
If you listen to me, I won't say it.

125
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,830
Xi Xi.

126
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,310
I just got rid of Song Jinghe and now you're here.

127
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,830
Speak, what do you want?

128
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,120
Xi'er, today I.

129
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,830
I have come to propose marriage.

130
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,240
You know my intentions

131
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,310
I have already prepared a hundred custom wedding carriages.

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,000
All pulled by heavenly steeds.

133
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,630
I said, I already have a husband.

134
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,390
Don't pester me anymore.

135
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,560
Xi'er.

136
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,070
My feelings for you have never changed

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
since we were young.

138
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,680
Come on, come into the palace with me.

139
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,920
Tonight, I will have my father annul your marriage contract.

140
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,120
Tomorrow, we will have a wedding ceremony.

141
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,270
The day after tomorrow, we will have an engagement ceremony.

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,070
Although royal weddings are complicated

143
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,270
I will personally oversee it.

144
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,070
Within three months, you and I will definitely be married.

145
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,480
Prince Ning, we have known each other for over twenty years.

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,360
You are really not my type.

147
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,430
Xi'er, I...

148
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,480
Not her type.

149
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,430
Xi xi

150
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I am willing to give you all my wealth.

151
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,390
Like this.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,190
Give me another chance.

153
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,160
How interesting.

154
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,600
I have no money.

155
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,000
What do I need your property for?

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,630
Exactly.

157
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,160
Property isn't cash.

158
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,240
When you really need it,

159
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,600
you'll have to sell the house.

160
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,720
It's no use.

161
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,070
And I've said it before,

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm already married.

163
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,390
Don't pester me anymore.

164
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,750
But,

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,510
if you can defeat him,

166
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,240
we can talk.

167
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,630
Wait.

168
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,830
Count me in.

169
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
How dare you come back?

170
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,800
I didn't enter.

171
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,870
Lingxi, don't worry.

172
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,160
Even if we don't go in,

173
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,800
we can still beat that kid down.

174
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,720
Get down.

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,750
I can't listen to this anymore.

176
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
What do you mean?

177
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
Do you think I'm a soft persimmon?

178
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,360
Let me tell you,

179
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,120
as long as I'm alive,

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,600
none of you will ever seize power from me.

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,430
You,

182
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,630
what gives you the right?

183
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,240
You're just a Tanhua, you don't
even have an official position.

184
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,830
You have no power, no money, and no ability.

185
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,430
What gives you the right to monopolize Xi'er?

186
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,510
What gives you the right?

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
I can't talk you out of it,

188
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,720
let's see who's better.

189
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,510
If you don't leave, I'll use my Qingyue Sword.

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,680
Xi'er,

191
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,070
Get lost.

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,750
Duoduo.

193
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,360
What are you looking at?

194
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,070
Nothing.

195
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,160
Oh, right, cousin.

196
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,070
I'm here to say goodbye.

197
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,160
Why say goodbye? Wait a couple of days.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,960
In a couple of days, I might host a
banquet for my relatives and friends.

199
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,910
To celebrate my return to being single.

200
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Cousin, you're not going to...

201
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,150
That's right. I'm divorcing him.

202
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,510
You're definitely eating this meal.

203
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,670
Stop picking.

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,600
You've torn the book.

205
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,550
Something on your mind?

206
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,840
I lost.

207
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,000
A real man

208
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,790
can take it and let it go.

209
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,630
What's there to be afraid of losing?

210
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
What's more,

211
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,750
I told you before.

212
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't bother Lingxi anymore.

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,390
I wish I could let it go.

214
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,390
But I can't accept it.

215
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,030
Imperial brother.

216
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,150
I always feel that Su Qingmo is suspicious.

217
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,440
Even if there is a problem,
it's a matter between the couple.

218
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,030
You're an outsider.

219
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:30,910
I.

220
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,510
That's right.

221
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Next month, the Soveriegn of Southern Kingdom will visit.

222
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,840
Su Qingmo is responsible for the reception.

223
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,550
You guys better behave yourselves.

224
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
What did you say?

225
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
You guys better behave yourselves.

226
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,270
No, the previous sentence.

227
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,000
Su Qingmo is responsible for the reception.

228
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,630
Is there a problem?

229
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,720
Yes, that's the sentence.

230
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,960
This brother of mine.

231
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,670
I wonder what tricks he has up his sleeve again.
