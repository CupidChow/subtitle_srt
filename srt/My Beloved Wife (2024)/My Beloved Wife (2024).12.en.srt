1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 12

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,600
Young Master,

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,030
after you returned from the post house last time

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,390
I sent someone to keep a close eye on the post house

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,760
I received an intel.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,350
The Sovereign of Southern Kingdom
has secretly sent an elite force.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,070
They have disguised themselves as
ordinary people and entered the city.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,280
More elite forces.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,880
Could it be that the ruler

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,920
is plotting something with him.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,920
Young Master, we must be on our guard.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,150
I'll go and discuss it with my grandfather.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,430
Yes, Young Master.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,840
You mean.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,430
The Sovereign of Southern Kingdom is plotting with others

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,560
to sow discord between you and Lingxi

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,350
and seize military power.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,110
That's right.

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,240
If they really intend to do this.

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,920
They will definitely resort to any means.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,430
To achieve their goal.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,640
The rabbits have left their burrow.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,840
What are you going to do?

25
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,790
I've decided to strike first.

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,840
Not giving them a chance to make a move.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,310
You should stay out of sight for now

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,510
I'll handle this matter.

29
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,070
Grandfather, this matter cannot be taken lightly.

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,480
Let me do it.

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,230
Lingxi is newly pregnant.

32
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,790
She needs your company the most.

33
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,040
You must take good care of Lingxi.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,120
As for other matters.

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,710
With me here

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,790
there's no need to be afraid.

37
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,680
Alright, Grandfather.

38
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,760
Then I'll go and calm Lingxi down

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,510
and try not to let her find out about this.

40
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,760
As a husband, one must be virtuous.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,230
If the wife is unhappy, it is the husband's fault.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,710
Marrying an unfaithful woman is not appropriate.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,870
Stop, stop, stop.

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,150
What kind of prenatal education is this?

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,950
The Code of Male Virtue.

46
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,430
I've been reciting this since I was a child.

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
If I couldn't recite it, my father would beat me.

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,630
So this is how your father-in-law educated you.

49
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,870
No wonder you can be presentable in public

50
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,520
and capable in the kitchen.

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,560
Can fight off hooligans and defeat mistresses.

52
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,910
Dear.

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,590
You've been praising

54
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,840
me a lot lately.

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,470
I'll go and make another pot of prenatal soup.

56
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,750
Come back, come back.

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,150
You're going to be a father soon.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
You're still acting like a child.

59
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,590
Miss, Master.

60
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,240
The Crown Prince has arrived.

61
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,470
It must be about the Sovereign of Southern Kingdom again.

62
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:43,960
Let's go.

63
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,190
Let's go and see this Crown Prince.

64
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,590
How eloquent he is.

65
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,710
Let's go.

66
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,430
Let's go.

67
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,800
Your Highness, what urgent matter brings you here?

68
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,280
To visit so late at night?

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,360
I heard before that.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,870
General Mu has always wanted to divorce Master Su.

71
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,910
Now is the perfect time.

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,080
Why are you unwilling again?

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,560
We didn't understand each other at the time.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,190
It was just a whim.

75
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,630
Now I know what kind of person Qingmo is.

76
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,150
We have a great relationship.

77
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,590
Naturally, we won't get a divorce.

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,400
Are you sure, General Mu?

79
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,870
Do you really understand Lord Su now?

80
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,960
Your Highness, you don't have to say any more.

81
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,520
I know you just want me to leave with the Emperor.

82
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,680
You should give up on this idea.

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,190
No matter what,

84
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,310
I will not abandon my wife and child.

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,870
I can understand your situation,

86
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,680
but the power of the Southern Kingdom
cannot be underestimated.

87
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,680
I have said all that I need to say.

88
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Lord Su, General Mu,

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,430
we are also in a difficult position.

90
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,470
I hope the two of you will reconsider.

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
There is no need to think about it.

92
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,960
I will not hand over Qingmo.

93
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
Are they trying to force me?

94
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,190
Dear, you must not be afraid.

95
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,390
We are husband and wife.

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,800
You must not agree to it.

97
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,510
You are mine.

98
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,310
If other women want to touch you,

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,750
they must first ask my sword.

100
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Miss, the Sovereign of Southern Kingdom has sent a letter.

101
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,480
You won't shed a tear until you see the coffin.

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm pregnant

103
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,270
and you still want to make trouble.

104
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,160
This.

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,430
Miss.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,630
What does the letter say?

107
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,000
She asked me where I usually go for beauty treatments.

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,950
Beauty treatments...

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,480
Miss.

110
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,600
She must be trying to take a roundabout approach.

111
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,190
You can't believe her.

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,270
No matter what tricks she tries to use,

113
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
I will not give up my husband.

114
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,240
The capital is my home ground.

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000
Since she wants to play,

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,240
I will play along.

117
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,870
Send it to the post house tomorrow.

118
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,720
Miss.

119
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,630
Are you going to challenge her?

120
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,870
That's right.

121
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,000
I, Mu Lingxi, am not someone
who will sit and wait for death.

122
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,190
Then I'll go

123
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,800
book the venue at the vegetable market.

124
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,680
Wait.

125
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,720
Why are you booking a venue?

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
If we fight,

127
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,870
we can't lose our momentum.

128
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,510
Booking a venue can also intimidate her a little.

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,630
Xiaoxue,

130
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,680
Even if you're smart,

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
don't forget to send the letter tomorrow.

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,600
Go quickly.

133
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,270
Why hasn't Her Lordship arrived yet?

134
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,270
Where did she go?

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,950
Let's just go.

136
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,430
We've waited long enough. I don't want to wait anymore.

137
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,120
Let's go, let's go.

138
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,430
I could have earned so much money in this time.

139
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,270
Let's go, let's go.

140
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,510
I think you're just scared.

141
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,830
To be honest, I don't want to deal with Su Qingmei anymore.

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,240
They have a good relationship.

143
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,560
They even have a child.

144
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,120
If we keep making trouble, it'll be too inhumane.

145
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,040
Li Xiao, what do you mean?

146
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,430
You were the one who said it in the first place.

147
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,950
The arrival of the Lordship is our chance.

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,630
Now you want to run away from the battle?

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,480
Are you even a man?

150
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,830
I'm talking to you, Leader Song.

151
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,240
What time is it now?

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,040
You're still thinking about driving a
wedge between Lingxi and Su Qingmo?

153
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,430
And also,

154
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,190
why did you scold the young prince?

155
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,920
I did it for the country.

156
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,270
The Sovereign of Southern Kingdom is willing

157
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,870
to exchange a city for Su Qingmo.

158
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,430
If I were the Crown Prince

159
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,680
I would do everything in my power to make it happen.

160
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,560
Lixiao.

161
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,560
As a prince

162
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,480
you are unwilling to strengthen the country.

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
In my opinion

164
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,480
you are not as good as the Crown Prince.

165
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,310
You!

166
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,800
Right.

167
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,360
You're right.

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
I am not worthy!

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
Those who do not share the same path cannot work together.

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,000
Your Highness.

171
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,720
Your Highness.

172
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,120
Indecisive.

173
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,720
Coward.

174
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,510
Your Highness.

175
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,870
Your Highness.

176
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,950
Don't be impulsive.

177
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,120
In my heart, you are already very good.

178
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,510
Don't listen to his nonsense.

179
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,160
Thank you.

180
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,360
Young.

181
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,120
Your Lordship, what are you looking at?

182
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,000
Mingyue.

183
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,790
Do you believe in love at first sight?

184
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,550
Your Lordship, you're doing it again.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
You are the leader of the First Gang, Song Jinghe?

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,510
That's right.

187
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,750
I've heard of you.

188
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,120
What do you want with me?

189
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,670
I can help you get Su Qingmo.

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,790
But I have my conditions.

191
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,200
Your Majesty.

192
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,080
Come in.

193
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,510
Your Lordship, she agreed.

194
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,360
General Mu.

195
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,510
You asked me to come here today

196
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,030
just to exploit my weakness?

197
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
You're not bad.

198
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,510
You chose a place that limits my abilities.

199
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,270
Enough talk. Let's fight.

200
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,360
You know Song Jinghe's ultimate move?

201
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,240
I underestimated you, woman.

202
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,550
Die!
