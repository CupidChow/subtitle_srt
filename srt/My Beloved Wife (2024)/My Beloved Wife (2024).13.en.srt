1
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 13

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,870
General Mu.

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,000
You asked me to come here today

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,510
just to exploit my weakness?

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,710
You're not bad yourself.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,160
You chose a place that limits my abilities.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,920
Enough talk. Let's fight.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,840
You know Song Jinghe's secret technique?

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,750
I underestimated you, woman.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,030
Die!

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,470
Guests.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
Feathers are for cleaning ears.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,880
Not for messing around.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,430
We'll pay more.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,790
Fine. Do whatever you want.

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,880
Qingli, do you really not like my husband anymore?

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,150
Of course not.

19
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,790
There are thousands of men in the world.

20
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,400
Why be obsessed with one man?

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,680
Besides,

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,230
someone actually used this matter to make a deal with me.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,790
I don't like it.

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,590
I don't like things that I don't have control over.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,000
But don't worry,

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,590
I, Qingli, am upright and honest.

27
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,280
I didn't agree to it at all.

28
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,710
From the way you were acting before,

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,430
I thought you were obsessed with Su Qingmo.

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,640
No, no.

31
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,430
The next one will be even better.

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,870
By the way, Qingli,

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,680
You said just now,

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,590
Someone used this matter to make a deal with you.

35
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,120
Who was it?

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,930
- That person is...
- Miss.

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,760
Your Lordship, the General, and the
Crown Prince request your presence.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,680
Let's go.

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,640
This cup of wine,

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,070
is to apologize to Lord Su and General Mu.

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,310
This cup is to implore Lord Su and General Mu.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,000
I hope you two will put the nation's affairs first.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,910
Since Her Lordship admires Lord Su.

44
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,960
Why don't General Mu, help make things happen?

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
Your Highness, you're going too far.

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,560
Moral blackmail.

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,080
There's no need to escalate this to
the level of national righteousness

48
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,910
I don't believe that without Qingmo

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,840
we and the Southern Kingdom will break off relations.

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,310
Everything I've done

51
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,080
has been for the sake of the entire kingdom.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,080
Your Highness.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,400
You know what you're thinking

54
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,080
I don't want to say much.

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,430
In short.

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,680
My wife and I will never be separated.

57
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,630
Don't refuse a toast.

58
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,590
Your Highness.

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
Don't force them.

60
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,710
I don't like Lord Su anymore.

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,000
So you're saying,

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,750
I was wrong about this

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I'll offer you three a toast.

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's forget about this.

65
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,080
Are you serious, Your Highness?

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,430
Of course.

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,590
His Highness has invited us to a banquet.

68
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,800
But I arrived late.

69
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,680
I am truly sorry.

70
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,630
In that case,

71
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,520
I will punish myself with three cups of wine.

72
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,470
Here.

73
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,840
Your Highness,

74
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Manager Mo, you don't have to blame yourself.

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,520
I invited you here today

76
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,680
to discuss the flooding in the south.

77
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,000
I should be the one drinking this wine.

78
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,360
Since Your Highness and Manager Mo

79
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,470
have other matters to discuss,

80
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,400
we will take our leave.

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,840
My wife needs to go back and take her prenatal medicine.

82
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Qingli,

83
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,000
Qingli, let's go.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
You two go ahead.

85
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,120
I have something else to do.

86
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,390
If Her Lordship really

87
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,800
wants me to go back with her

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,950
what will you do?

89
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,160
Do you know

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,750
I think Qingli said something very right.

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
There are thousands of men in the world.

92
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,920
Why bother being infatuated with you,
a single blade of grass.

93
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,160
I won't give you

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,560
the chance to look at other men.

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Don't think that just because
you're the sovereign of Southern Kingdom.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,270
You can do whatever you want.

97
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,720
What are you doing?

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
Little thing.

99
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,430
Your performance were great last night.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,310
Performance...

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,000
What performance?

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
Come with me.

103
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,800
If I go with you, where will we go?

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
I know.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,070
The fortune teller said

106
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,560
you need to find a powerful woman

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,950
in order to become rich.

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,430
That's right.

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,630
That's why I have to marry Mu Lingxi.

110
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,360
Where would I go with you?

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,270
Do you think the general is powerful

112
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,070
or am I, the sovereign of a country, more powerful?

113
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,270
What you said seems to make some sense.

114
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,070
Could the person the fortune teller told me about

115
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,000
be you?

116
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,040
Come on, hurry up.

117
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,270
You two put it over there.

118
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,190
You two put it over here.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,870
Okay.

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,630
Wait.

121
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,750
How many more cribs are there?

122
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,160
Four in total.

123
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,270
Why did you buy so many beds?

124
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,390
Didn't you say

125
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,390
that you wanted to give Grandfaher
a bunch of great-grandchildren?

126
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,630
You wish.

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
Young Master.

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Was kidnapped...

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,950
Slow down, slow down.

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,120
Was kidnapped...

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,750
What was kidnapped?

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,920
That.

133
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,950
That.

134
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,630
That.

135
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,600
That, that.

136
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,360
You idiot.

137
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,310
Let me tell you.

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,830
Miss, Master.

139
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,750
Shopkeeper Mo was kidnapped by Her Lordship

140
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,070
and he also took Shopkeeper Mo's dowry.

141
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,630
How did they get together?

142
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,830
Miss.

143
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,560
Last night, after you finished drinking.

144
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,950
Shopkeeper Mo and Her Lordship

145
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,920
somehow ended up sleeping together.

146
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,040
It's...

147
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Although this Shopkeeper Mo

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
is not a gentleman

149
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,360
he wouldn't do something so outrageous.

150
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,040
Qingli said

151
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,600
she has someone new she likes.

152
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,480
Maybe it's Mo Shaokuan.

153
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,680
That way they'll end up together.

154
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,240
Indeed.

155
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Then we must prepare a generous gift for them

156
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,600
to celebrate Shopkeeper Mo marrying into a prominent family.

157
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,750
Yes.

158
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,120
Master.

159
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,800
Her Lordship also gave you a letter

160
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,240
I put it there for you.

161
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,070
Let's go pick out a gift.

162
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,630
Let's go.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
Slow down.

164
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,030
I remember when Miss and Master

165
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,390
first got married.

166
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
At that time.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,150
Miss kept saying she wanted to divorce Master.

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,360
Look at how sweet they are now.

169
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,550
It's great.

170
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,510
What is this?

171
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,120
This is my family heirloom.

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
My mother said

173
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,720
to give it to a future daughter-in-law.

174
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,150
You

175
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,030
know what I mean.

176
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,240
I have an older brother back home who hasn't married yet.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,240
He's handsome

178
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,440
and works in the government office.

179
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,000
Would you like to consider him?

180
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,080
Ah Wen.

181
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,910
You idiot.

182
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,080
What did I say wrong?

183
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,910
Send this letter out.

184
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,000
Tell the other party.

185
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,510
The crisis has been temporarily lifted.

186
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,360
Young Master.

187
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,320
You said that the Sovereign of Southern Kingdom
sent elite soldiers into the city this time.

188
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,750
Was it just to steal a man?

189
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,390
Her Lordship saw through my defenses.

190
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,550
She said in the letter she sent me.

191
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,150
She didn't send troops to cause trouble.

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,200
But if she has nothing to do with that person.

193
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,720
Then the secret letter in the tapestry record

194
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,030
must be suspicious.

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,510
Young Master.

196
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't you plan to tell the general?

197
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,080
Wait a little longer.

198
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,440
She just got pregnant.

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,630
Don't let her worry.

200
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,720
Yes, Young Master.
