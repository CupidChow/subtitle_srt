1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 5

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,480
When the Emperor granted me a marriage,

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,440
if General Mu's hadn't said a word

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,510
that the two of you were already betrothed.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,230
I imagine today, General Mu

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,920
would have been my Crown Princess.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,600
Your Highness.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,480
My wife and I are already married.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,000
I hope Your Highness will consider my wife's reputation.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,430
And not mention this matter again.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,150
It was my fault.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,640
In the future, I ask that Lord Su

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,150
take good care of General Mu.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,880
I must return to the palace.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,030
Please stay.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,920
Don't think of everyone as your enemy, okay?

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,390
I'm already married.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,870
Besides, Your Highness will
soon be taking a Crown Princess.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,760
Be more open-minded.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Dear, does this mean you don't want to divorce me?

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,040
It depends on your behavior.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,560
What's wrong?

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,870
Dear

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,560
I just made you some chicken soup. Try it.

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,350
What are you doing?

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
Don't think that just because you're nice to me,
I won't divorce you.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,510
If you want to divorce me,

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
you'll have to have the strength to do it.

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,350
Slow down.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,430
Be careful, it's hot.

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,870
Listen,

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,310
a week before your period, you must take care of your body.

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,150
You can't eat cold or raw foods.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, alright. You're nagging me to death.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
It's just my period.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,310
It's not like I'm seriously ill.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,560
I just made some brown sugar water.

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,590
It will make you feel much better.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,030
You're so naggy.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,430
Give it to me.

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,750
Dear.

43
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,870
You look so beautiful when you're fierce.

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,960
Let me tell you.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,000
I grew up on the battlefield.

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,910
I've seen all kinds of storms.

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,080
This little favors...

48
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,520
Don't expect me to fall for you.

49
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,280
Dear.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,430
What I want

51
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,120
has never been how much you like me.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
As long as I can be by your side.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,430
That's enough.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
You're so good at sweet talk.

55
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,360
You must be very experienced.

56
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,520
Of course.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,520
Then I must divorce you.

58
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,840
Miss.

59
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,630
Miss.

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
His Majesty has ordered that

61
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,240
His Majesty will soon be hosting a banquet for Wuying

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
and you are to accompany him.

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,470
Wuying?

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll go get a new dress right now.

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,190
Dear.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Master.

67
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,470
This time, you might really get divorced.

68
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,910
Wuying is the hero that Miss has long admired.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,120
He even saved Miss before.

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,080
The fake Wuying has appeared again.

71
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,870
Why are you following me?

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,590
Dear, what else can I do but follow you?

73
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,710
Naturally, I'm here to carry your bags and pay for things.

74
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,590
You think I don't know what you're up to?

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,030
What are you standing there for? Let's go.

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,910
I'll give you a chance to carry my bags and pay for things.

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Coming.

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,360
I didn't think shopping would be so tiring.

79
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,390
I'm not going to shop anymore.

80
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,310
Dear, you're going to meet Wuying.

81
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,510
How can you say you're tired?

82
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,720
Come on, let's keep shopping.

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,720
Are you a scholar?

84
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,920
You have more stamina than me.

85
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,950
What are you doing?

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,270
Hey!

87
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,000
What's going on?

88
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,120
Put me down!

89
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,430
I'm a great general!

90
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,750
How can I let someone carry me like this?

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,920
If you don't say it and I don't say it, no one will know.

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,680
It's over. Now the whole city knows.

93
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,870
Young Master Mo

94
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,950
Shopkeeper, help me take a look.

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,870
Is that Lingxi?

96
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,040
Yes, Young Master.

97
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,070
Lingxi,

98
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,750
I didn't expect you two

99
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,950
to have developed to this point.

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,750
That's right.

101
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,190
My husband and I are now deeply in love.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,430
You shouldn't have any more fantasies about me.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,630
Young Master

104
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,040
Shopkeeper

105
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,720
Did you hear?

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
Is this something a human would say?

107
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,070
Such predatory words!

108
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,240
Lingxi,

109
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,160
You're free to like whoever you want.

110
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,360
But I'm also free to like you.

111
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,680
I...

112
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,270
Shopkeeper,

113
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,390
All the clothes I bought today,

114
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,390
give them all to these two.

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,160
Just think of it as a wedding gift from me to Lingxi.

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,240
Yes, Young Master.

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,430
Lingxi,

118
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,750
I will not give up.

119
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,310
The Mo money house is my dowry.

120
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,630
Wait for me.

121
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,600
You!

122
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,240
I...

123
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,800
I...

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
Youn..

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
Put me down.

126
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,920
I said this person is sick.

127
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,270
This is not giving up.

128
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,040
Shopkeeper.

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,190
Yes.

130
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,510
Return all the clothes he ordered.

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
My woman,

132
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
doesn't need someone else to buy her clothes.

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,040
Take out the best clothes

134
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,310
in your store out for me.

135
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,950
Okay, okay, sir.

136
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,190
Please come in.

137
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,830
This sudden domineering.

138
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,270
It's actually a bit charming.

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,630
Mu Lingxi.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
You wouldn't really like him, would you?

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,480
Shopkeeper

142
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,430
Go take the late Master Xi Yin's

143
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,830
last piece of work

144
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,870
That piece of clothing...

145
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,000
was made by Master Xi Yin before he passed away

146
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,680
It's quite expensive

147
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,070
You...

148
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,040
Don't

149
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,830
Yes.

150
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
I will obey

151
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,070
I'll go get it now

152
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,510
When the Missus asks later

153
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
You know what to say, right?

154
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
I understand, I understand

155
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,000
General Mu

156
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,430
These are the new clothes that just arrived at our shop

157
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Why don't you try them on?

158
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,310
That Young Master at our shop

159
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,630
has already bought ten pieces of clothing

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
This piece of clothing is a gift for you

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,310
Please try it on

162
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,070
Dear, it's free anyway

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Don't let it go to waste

164
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,360
Why don't we try it on?

165
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,800
Alright, let's try it on

166
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,800
Bring it over

167
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,950
Sure thing

168
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you doing?

169
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,510
Why are you making that face?

170
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,270
Don't you like it?

171
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,830
No.

172
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
I just feel that I'm not worthy

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,630
marrying a fairy.

174
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,720
Your mouth is so sweet. Did you eat honey?

175
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
You're annoying.

176
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm not lying.

177
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,510
If I'm lying,

178
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,870
may I be struck by lightning.

179
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,390
Dear, why don't we go back first?

180
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,480
Cousin

181
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,510
Duoduo

182
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,790
Did Young Master Mo Shaokuan give you this dress?

183
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
No

184
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,600
I bought too many clothes

185
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,960
The owner of Zhijinji gave it to me

186
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,960
Cousin, all you do every day is practice martial arts

187
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,630
You don't even know how famous this dress is

188
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
It's just a dress

189
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,750
What's so special about it?

190
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,750
This is the last dress that Master Xi Yin

191
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,440
made before he passed away

192
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,870
It's priceless

193
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,000
Even royalty can't buy it

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,390
But the person who gave you this dress

195
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,670
must really, really like you

196
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,320
You're so young

197
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
but you know so much

198
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,550
He really carried Lingxi on his back

199
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,030
and bought her clothes.

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,030
That's right.

201
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,840
They left.

202
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,390
I only found out after bribing the shop assistant.

203
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,480
That Su Qingmo,

204
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,670
I don't know how he did it.

205
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,960
He actually bought the dress made by Master Xi Yin

206
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,750
and bought it.

207
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,240
What?

208
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,440
I couldn't buy that dress even if I went there myself.

209
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,720
He actually bought it.

210
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,840
This kid has something.

211
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,360
Mo Shaokuan.

212
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,510
Isn't your father the richest man in the capital?

213
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,840
Let him buy the shop.

214
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,600
Then we'll take care of Lingxi's clothes.

215
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,790
That's a good idea.

216
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,840
You're still the leader of the First Gang.

217
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,960
Why don't you go and rob that store?

218
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,870
That way I won't have to spend any money.

219
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,510
That's right.

220
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,320
Your Highness,

221
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,550
why don't you

222
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,240
just send someone to shut down that shop?

223
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
Then none of us will have to
go shopping for clothes anymore.

224
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
What do you guys know?

225
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,360
His Majesty has already
appointed him as a Minister of Rites.

226
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,750
His background must be extraordinary.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,240
I don't dare to act rashly.

228
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,870
Dear,

229
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
If you want to practice archery, then practice archery.

230
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,390
Don't scare me.

231
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Look how scared you are.

232
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,630
Dear,

233
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,240
I want to learn archery too.

234
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,510
Who's teaching who?

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
You teach me.

236
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,200
You use your strength.

237
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,390
I'll follow you.

238
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,510
Bullseye.

239
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,000
Miss.

240
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Miss, Wuying has arrived at the Crown Prince's mansion.

241
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,870
Wuying!

242
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,790
Let's go quickly.

243
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,910
Dear.

244
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,480
What's wrong with you?

245
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,670
Hey, what's wrong with you?

246
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,600
Dear, this is the first time you've kissed me.

247
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,000
Can you do it again?

248
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,440
Get lost!

249
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,240
How dare you lie to me?

250
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,960
I'll kick you to death!

251
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,600
Miss.

252
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,510
Then you're not going to see the Shadow Knight?

253
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,030
No, I'm not going.

254
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I have to discipline my husband now.

255
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
I don't have time to see him.

256
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,790
Ah Xue, bring me another plate of peanuts.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,480
Coming right up.

258
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,550
No, no, no.

259
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,630
Get up!

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,870
General Mu, Lord Su.

261
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,510
The Crown Prince is hosting a
banquet for Wuying today.

262
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,200
He has specially invited the
General and the Lord to attend.

263
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
It's a good thing I disguised myself last time.

264
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
Otherwise, I would have been exposed.
