1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 1

3
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:25,920
Report.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,870
Reporting to the general.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,640
What is it?

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
General Mu has sent a message.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,760
Old general wants you to go back

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,710
and marry Su Qingmo.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,710
If you don't go back.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,670
He will give away all the bows and
arrows you have painstakingly collected

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,560
as well as all the famous swords

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,200
and burn all your martial arts manuals.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,640
Also.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,390
Stop!

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,470
Get married.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,880
I don't even know who I'm marrying.

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,350
How can I get married?

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,240
Besides.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,350
Someone like me.

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,600
A young woman who has become a general.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,110
Getting married will only hinder my progress.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,350
Old General Mu also said.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,000
If you obediently go back and get married.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
He will give you the Qingyue Sword.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,230
That old man wants to use the precious Qingyue Sword

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,230
to bribe me.

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,000
So you still won't go back.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,230
Of course

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,000
I will go back.

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,760
Cousin.

31
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,070
Duoduo, why are you here?

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,120
Cousin is about to get married.

33
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,400
Of course I've to come to see you off.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,350
Wrong, Duoduo.

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,120
Cousin is marrying a husband, not getting married.

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,870
This old man is too impatient.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,590
He didn't even go through the engagement
process and is getting married directly

38
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,680
I'll go find him.

39
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,760
As long as you get married this time without any trouble

40
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,590
and wear the wedding gown

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,920
this sword will be yours.

42
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,430
I don't even know who I'm marrying.

43
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,950
My old friend's grandson, Su Qingmo.

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,680
It's just that his age

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,950
is a few years younger than yours.

46
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,230
How can he be younger than me?

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,950
He just passed the imperial examination

48
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,840
and is not worse than you.

49
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,040
Xiaoxue, take the young lady to get ready.

50
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,560
Stop right there.

51
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,590
I'm telling you, Xi'er.

52
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,150
You just need to marry her peacefully

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
and our Mu family will have an heir.

54
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,000
If you want a child

55
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,710
you can have one yourself.

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,000
Why are you bothering me?

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,870
How dare you talk to your grandfather like that?

58
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,190
Let me tell you again.

59
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,150
As long as you marry Su Qingmo

60
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,080
this sword will be yours immediately.

61
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,840
Words are not enough.

62
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,590
Let's make a pinky promise.

63
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,360
Okay.

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Miss, are you really going to marry that scholar?

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,840
I will marry him.

66
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,240
I have always wanted the Qingyue Sword.

67
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,080
Since the old man is willing to give it to me,

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,750
I must get my hands on it no matter what.

69
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,560
As for that kid,

70
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,800
if he has the guts to come in,

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,150
I have the guts to throw him out.

72
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,080
Who is it?

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,000
Who?

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Who is it?

75
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,870
Don't mess around.

76
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,960
I am Wuying.
[Lit. Shadowless]

77
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,030
What a joke.

78
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,190
How dare you, a fake, clamor here?

79
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,710
Don't play tricks.

80
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,280
If you have the guts, come out.

81
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
Let's fight.

82
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,590
In front of the real Thousand Soul Slash.

83
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,470
You dare to call yourself Shadowless.

84
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,430
Your skin is really thick

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm just

86
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,750
having fun.

87
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,280
But please don't

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,400
joke about dignity.

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Who are you?

90
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,150
Shadowless.

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Blocking the sword for the person behind you.

92
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,280
Don't you feel unwilling.

93
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,400
Don't move.

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,030
Be a man.

95
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,120
You make me raise my dignity.

96
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,030
Hit me again.

97
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,360
Who was the one who fought you just now?

98
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,560
He said he is the real Shadowless.

99
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,120
Master.

100
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,390
Isn't Shadowless just a title?

101
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
Then from today onwards,

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,510
I am the real Shadowless.

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,000
Master.

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,240
I have also heard some news.

105
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't you want the Mu family's military power?

106
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,120
I have a plan.

107
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,430
Even if you don't marry Mu Lingxi,

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,120
you can still obtain the military power.

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,750
Tell me about it.

110
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,390
I have learned

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,750
that old General Mu.

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,870
Gave Mu Lingxi a Qingyue Sword.

113
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,360
But did not give her the Mu army tiger tally.

114
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,680
But this Mu family army must have both.

115
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,750
The Qingyue Sword and the Mu army tiger tally

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
in order to command the army.

117
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,360
However, this Mu Lingxi

118
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,430
does not know the function of this sword.

119
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,190
She only thinks it is a.

120
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,000
Rare and precious sword.

121
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,480
You mean to say

122
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,560
the Mu family's military power is
still in the hands of old General Mu.

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,800
He has not yet given it to Mu Lingxi.

124
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,360
That's right.

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,950
Master, I have a plan.

126
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,830
That will definitely help you obtain the military power

127
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,600
Su Qingmo, Mu Lingxi.

128
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,000
We have plenty of time.

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,070
Grandpa hasn't come yet after such a long time.

130
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,560
Could he have run away from the wedding?

131
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,600
Xi'er, don't be impatient.

132
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,070
Wait a little longer.

133
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,560
Then you can wait. I can't wait any longer.

134
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,950
Ah Xue, prepare the horse. I'll go and get him myself.

135
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,120
Why are you being willful again?

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,870
I, your son-in-law, have arrived late.

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,800
I hope my wife and all the elders will forgive me.

138
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,720
Listen,

139
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,430
I hate people who are not punctual the most.

140
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,390
Once you enter my Mu family,

141
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,600
you must listen to me in everything.

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
My wife,

143
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,480
please accept your husband's bow.

144
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,390
Good, my good grandson.

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
It's great that you could come on time.

146
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,120
From today onwards,

147
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,920
I will entrust my granddaughter to you.

148
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,680
You must treat her well.

149
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,720
No matter what problems arise in the future,

150
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,190
you can tell me.

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,510
I will support you spiritually

152
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,160
and absolutely support you.

153
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,070
Thank you, Grandpa.

154
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,870
Crown Prince.

155
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,950
The King of Southern Country
will visit the capital next month.

156
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,800
Who do you think is suitable to receive him?

157
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,430
Your Majesty

158
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Su Qingmo, the newly appointed Tanhua, is suitable.
[*Highest scorer in the Imperial Exam]

159
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
I have met him once.

160
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,510
He is handsome and eloquent.

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,510
I believe he will be able to

162
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,560
make the Soveriegn of Southern Kingdom
feel the grandeur of our country.

163
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,160
Su Qingmo,

164
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,190
didn't you ask him to go to the Ministry of Justice?

165
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,630
Your Majesty.

166
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,630
Isn't the Ministry of Rites more suitable for him?

167
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,600
Is that so?

168
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,270
I'll think about it.

169
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,920
Alright, you may leave now.

170
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,360
Your Majesty, I'll take my leave.

171
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,510
Your Majesty,

172
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,040
The Crown Prince has already extended
his influence to the Ministry of Justice.

173
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,720
You must be on your guard.

174
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,160
He's already like this without any real power.

175
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,720
If I let him manage the affairs of state,

176
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,950
the court will be turned upside down.

177
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,120
Your Majesty,

178
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Prince Ning has already donated

179
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,510
all his wealth to help the victims of the disaster.

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,310
The rebellion in the south has now been quelled.

181
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,910
Xiao'er is a good boy.

182
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,120
Compared to him,

183
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,630
he is more suited to be the master of this country.

184
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,080
It's just that Xiao'er's personality is gentle and yielding,

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,240
he still needs a capable person
like Su Qingmo to assist him.

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,750
Your Majesty, do you intend to...

187
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,960
What are you doing here?

188
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,510
My wife is above me

189
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,510
pressing me so that I can't move.

190
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,240
What happened last night?

191
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,320
As expected of the most beautiful scholar in Xi.

192
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,480
The man in the dreams of countless young girls.

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,440
Look at this skin.

194
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,750
White and tender.

195
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,510
As smooth as an egg.

196
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,870
Dear

197
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,200
can we drink the nuptial wine now?

198
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,390
Drink what wine?

199
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
A spring night is worth a thousand gold.

200
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,150
This general.

201
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,030
Has already driven out the idlers outside the door.

202
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,270
They have all been driven out.

203
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,480
Let's go straight to bed.

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,840
Isn't it too fast?

205
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,120
Or should we follow the procedure?

206
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,600
To get a good start.

207
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,480
Don't struggle, kid.

208
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,080
Bear with it for one night.

209
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,550
When I greet my grandfather at dawn,

210
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,870
I'll tell him

211
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
that you're the one who can't consummate the marriage.

212
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,720
The wedding will be canceled.

213
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,630
But

214
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,440
you'd better cooperate with me.

215
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,630
Otherwise, I don't mind crippling you myself.

216
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,120
Isn't this the old man's best wine?

217
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,480
He's brought it out.

218
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,080
It would be rude not to drink it.

219
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,360
That was not satisfying.

220
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Where did this little husband come from?

221
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
He's quite handsome.

222
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
Mu Lingxi,

223
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,790
you should have married a young man like this.

224
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,720
He's fair and tender.

225
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,080
Then divorce that husband of yours.

226
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,030
Listen,

227
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,240
if you dare to tell anyone about what happened last night.

228
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,120
I will cut off your tongue.

229
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,440
Young master.

230
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Young master.

231
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,550
Young master.

232
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,750
What kind of childhood sweetheart wife?

233
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,030
She's a tigress.

234
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,150
In my opinion.

235
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,790
You should show her your skills.

236
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,510
Let her see how powerful you are.

237
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,320
Nonsense.

238
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,960
Have you forgotten why we came to the capital.

239
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,550
We can't reveal our martial arts skills so easily.

240
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,750
My wife just doesn't have feelings for me yet.

241
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,960
When the time is right.

242
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,150
She will definitely...

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,030
Divorce you!
