1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 6

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,350
Shadowless Sword.

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,870
So fast you can't see it.

5
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,350
It's you again

6
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,110
I didn't beat you enough last time.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,960
You're out here embarrassing yourself again.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,470
Good.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,750
Good

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,000
I've heard of your martial arts skills for a long time

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,240
I see that you live up to your reputation.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,350
Your sword is a fine sword.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,640
That's right, my sword is no ordinary sword.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,950
Combined with my swordsmanship.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,120
No one can withstand three moves from me.

16
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,480
Yes, this duck couldn't withstand it.

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,280
I've only heard of your martial arts prowess

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,120
I didn't expect to see you today

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,280
and you're so handsome

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm impressed, impressed.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,200
My damn charm.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,070
This is the Shadowless Swordsman
that Lingxi has admired for so long.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,070
Shadowless Swordsman.

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,480
Dear.

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,000
You admire him?

26
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,710
Lord Su

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,840
I heard you don't know martial arts.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,310
But you were able to defeat Prince Ning

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,350
and his men.

30
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,230
Today.

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,120
Do you dare to compete with me?

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,710
Since you're giving me face

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,950
I'll accept your challenge.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,040
But what should we compete in

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,710
I'll decide that.

36
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,590
What are you doing.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,870
You don't know martial arts.

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,310
Why bother with him?

39
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,710
Dear, rest assured.

40
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,800
I want to compete with him.

41
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,280
Poetry.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,630
The sun sets behind the mountain.

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,870
Lord Su is well-versed in literature.

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,870
Su Qingmo, how can you cheat?

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,560
Besides, this poem is not taught in the Men's Virtue Class.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,590
No.

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,400
No.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,750
No, no.

49
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,470
Didn't we agree to compete?

50
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,960
What kind of competition is this?

51
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,910
Am I not the Shadowless Swordsman?

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,430
You're not playing by the rules.

53
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,910
The Shadowless Swordsman must be

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,960
able to show his charm through martial arts.

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,240
Ah Xi.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,590
When you first saw me, did you sense

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
we were destined for each other in pervious life

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
the moment you saw me?

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,560
That's right.

60
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,560
Today's meeting

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,960
is heaven's way of letting us reconnect.

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,310
Young hero.

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,710
How do you know it's not a karmic debt.

64
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,590
Karmic debt.

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,710
That's also a kind of connection.

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Would you like to go boating on the lake with me tomorrow.

67
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,360
That's not necessary.

68
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,710
Tomorrow I have to help my cockroach give birth

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,310
I don't have time to accompany you.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,710
Why don't you ask Prince Ning to go with you.

71
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,470
Okay.

72
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,470
How about the day after tomorrow.

73
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,870
You don't have to worry about whether I'm busy.

74
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,560
As long as you ask me

75
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,400
I'll make time to accompany you.

76
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm really sorry

77
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,750
I don't have time the day after tomorrow either.

78
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,800
As long as you ask me

79
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,150
I never have time.

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,750
I understand.

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
Ah Xi.

82
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,400
You're such a kind person.

83
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,520
Are you afraid to make an appointment with me

84
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,240
because the lord will be heartbroken?

85
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,190
It's okay. I have a way.

86
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,120
I have a way to stop him from being heartbroken.

87
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,240
I'll kill him.

88
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,870
Wuying.

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
You want to hurt my people in front of me?

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,680
Do you think I'm easy to bully?

91
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,000
No, I...

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,830
Perhaps the young hero has had too much to drink.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,600
I...

94
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,040
I think we should all leave for today.

95
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,390
Thank you for your hospitality, Your Highness.

96
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,680
We will take our leave first.

97
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,510
No.

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,310
Let's go.

99
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,950
Move.

100
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,430
I... I'm just afraid that he'll be heartbroken.

101
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,360
I...

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,750
You...

103
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,480
No.

104
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
I... I just...

105
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,830
Young hero.

106
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,120
Please.

107
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,190
Who asked him to confess.

108
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,560
Doesn't he know that he's

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,510
just an actor we hired.

110
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,270
He really thinks he's the Shadowless Swordsman

111
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,070
I think he's trying to change the script for himself.

112
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,040
Dream on.

113
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,360
Look at how excited he is

114
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,480
I find him more annoying than Su Qingmo now

115
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,510
Su Qingmo isn't as greasy as him.

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
In comparison

117
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,870
Su Qingmo seems more pleasing to the eye.

118
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,720
You're even speaking up for Su Qingmo?

119
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,510
Where's your stance?

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Where's your stance?

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,190
Stance.

122
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,430
What stance?

123
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,240
Can you eat your stance?

124
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,830
I like Lingxi.

125
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,510
If I could marry her,

126
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,190
I could become

127
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,800
the one person below only the
emperor and above ten thousand people.

128
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,600
Whether it's Wuyin or Su Qingmo,

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,870
I'll have to kill them.

130
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,160
You're ambitious.

131
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm different.

132
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,800
The fortune teller said.

133
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,390
If I could marry

134
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,270
the most powerful woman in the world.

135
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,430
I could become

136
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,240
the richest man in the world.

137
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,070
So, Lingxi...

138
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm going to marry her for sure.

139
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,830
Superficial.

140
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,600
You two just want to use Lingxi.

141
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,630
I'm the only one who truly loves Lingxi.

142
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,800
We grew up together as childhood sweethearts.

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
How could she be taken by that

144
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,000
parachuted-in Su Qingmo?

145
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,190
I'm not convinced.

146
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
As the saying goes,

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,920
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

148
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,070
At this point,

149
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,480
If we want to get rid of that Shadowless guy,

150
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,680
We can only rely on him.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
You mean him?

152
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,360
Him?

153
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,630
Him?

154
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,560
She really won't accept it?

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,870
She won't accept it?

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
Young hero, please leave.

157
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,680
Impossible!

158
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,480
Absolutely impossible!

159
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,390
This is a gilded armor!

160
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,750
Ah Xi can't possibly dislike it.

161
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,750
Ah Wen,

162
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,240
Gilded armor,

163
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
The armor I give my wife is all pure gold.

164
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,430
Have you seen it?

165
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,630
I bought this myself from the Southern Kingdom.

166
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,240
Night-illuminating pearl.

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
The night-illuminating pearl I gave to my wife.

168
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,630
It's used as a nightlight in the manor.

169
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,870
We don't need your one or two pearls.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,040
Alright, you're quite capable.

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,830
You definitely don't have this.

172
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Do you have it?

173
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,240
Do you have it?

174
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,070
Does it look like it?

175
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,360
This is my self-portrait, signed by me.

176
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,240
Ah Xi has admired me for a long time.

177
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,510
She'll definitely love it if she receives this.

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,120
Young hero, don't be so confident.

179
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,080
Do you really think my wife thinks about you all the time?

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,790
Pack up and go back to your hometown.

181
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,910
Don't force me to reveal your true identity.

182
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,600
You're just jealous of me.

183
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,510
Jealous of my irresistible charm.

184
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,030
Good riddance.

185
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,630
Jealous of me.

186
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,390
You idiot.

187
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,200
I arranged for you to go to the capital

188
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,720
and to pretend to be the Shadowless Swordsman.

189
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
I wanted you to sow discord

190
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,030
between Su Qingmo and Mu Lingxi.

191
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,600
Not only did you fail to deceive them.

192
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,080
You also made me lose face.

193
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,790
What use are you to me?

194
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,200
Master, you can't say that.

195
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,440
Master.

196
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,000
Look at me, from head to toe.

197
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,630
I exude irresistible charm.

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,150
I just don't understand that Su Qingmo.

199
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,910
What underhanded tricks did he use?

200
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
To prevent me from seeing Mu Lingxi.

201
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,120
But my lord, I have another plan.

202
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,840
I guarantee it will eliminate Murong Xi and Su Qingmo.

203
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,320
Tell me about it.

204
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,910
Your plan is very good.

205
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
You see, right?

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,270
Master, look. If we do it this way,

207
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,550
Then I...

208
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,750
Since you've already been exposed,

209
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,720
there's no need to keep a fool.

210
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,790
Su Qingmo, Mu Lingxi,

211
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,200
this time, you two are dead for sure.
