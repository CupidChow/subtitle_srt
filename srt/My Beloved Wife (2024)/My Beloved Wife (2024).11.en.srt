1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 11

3
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,030
Please respect yourself. I am already married.

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,920
You misunderstand, sir.

5
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,000
I just wanted to ask where you live, sir.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,320
So I can visit you to express my gratitude.

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,880
No need.

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,200
Miss.

9
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,030
I was so scared just now.

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,230
Miss, what are you looking at?

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Mingyue.

12
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,040
Do you believe in love at first sight?

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,640
Lingxi, I came to see you yesterday
and saw that your injuries were serious.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,350
But I've been busy with government affairs.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,760
I didn't have time to bring you any supplements.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,150
Today, I finally had some free time.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,350
So I rushed over.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
This is lingzhi that I brought for you from the palace.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,070
Take it to help you recover.

20
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,200
You don't have to bother, Your Highness.

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,790
The food that Qingmo makes
for me is already very nourishing.

22
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,870
That's different.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,840
This is a token of my feelings for you.

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,280
Lingzhi is so precious.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,560
How can I accept it?

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,120
I heard that

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,510
you were injured on your way to the military camp.

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,870
As the Crown Prince,

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,310
it is my duty to come and visit you.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Do you think this lingzhi is not good enough?

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
I dare not. Your Highness has misunderstood me.

32
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,710
Since Your Highness is so kind,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,590
I will accept it with gratitude.

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,120
By the way, I have one more thing to say.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Please speak, Your Highness.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,030
Prince Xiao has been bothering
you a lot these past few days.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,910
I hope you don't mind.

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,680
He just likes you too much.

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,750
He can't let go for the time being.

40
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,680
In that case,

41
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,840
please help me tell him,

42
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,030
my husband and I have a very good relationship.

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,750
Please ask Prince Ning to stop bothering us.

44
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,400
Don't worry, I will definitely pass on your message.

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,190
I am Su Qingmo, the Minister of Rites.

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

47
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,280
She is the ruler of the Southern Kingdom?

48
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,520
Please enter the sedan, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,560
This woman can join forces with him.

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,000
She must be extraordinary.

51
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,590
I must be on guard.

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,190
Everyone,

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,910
Please,

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
I never thought,

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,630
That the Sovereign of the Southern Kingdom,

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,870
would be such a young woman.

57
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,120
The Sovereign has managed to govern
the Southern Kingdom so well,

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,910
She is truly young and promising.

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,080
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,560
The Southern Kingdom is a small country on the outskirts,

61
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,280
with a small population,

62
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,560
so it is naturally easier to manage.

63
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Your Lordship is too modest.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
Your Lordship's visit this time,

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,830
is it because of the border issue with the merchants

66
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,920
between our two kingdoms?

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,190
Indeed.

68
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,360
I hope Your Majesty

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,190
can grant me a request?

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,070
Everything will be easier.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
Please speak, Your Lordship.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,390
That will depend on Minister Su.

73
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,750
Minister Su, do you still remember me?

74
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,750
Your Lordship.

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,040
My husband has never met you.

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,830
How could he remember you?

77
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
That day, I almost got hit.

78
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,800
Minister Su saved me.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,190
Your Lordship's visit this time

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,000
is to discuss trade between our two kingdoms.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,920
How did you set your sights on Minister Su?

82
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,360
I can cede

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,600
the most prosperous city on the border to you.

84
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,800
But,

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,310
I have one condition.

86
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Your Lordship, please speak.

87
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,750
I want him

88
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,800
to come back to the Southern Kingdom
with me and be my husband.

89
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,560
I...

90
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,270
Impossible.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm already pregnant.

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,430
You can't just watch my child

93
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,630
without a father before they're even born.

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,750
So soon?

95
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,360
Dear.

96
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,510
Didn't we agree.

97
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,070
The pregnancy is unstable, let's not talk about it for now.

98
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,600
Come, sit down.

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,870
General Mu's pregnancy is a big deal.

100
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,870
Someone,

101
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,070
summon the imperial physician.

102
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,950
Come and check General Mu's pulse.

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,630
Prescribe some medicine to stabilize the pregnancy.

104
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,070
I thank Your Highness.

105
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,870
My wife has been under the care of the same physician.

106
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,510
There is no need to trouble the imperial physician.

107
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
As for the Her Majesty's intentions,

108
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,870
I can only disappoint her.

109
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,310
This cup of tea,

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,240
I will use it as a substitute for wine,

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
to apologize to you.

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,310
I do not believe that being the husband
of the ruler of the Southern Kingdom,

113
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,160
could be less enjoyable than your life here.

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Minister Su,

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
think carefully about this.

116
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,600
Minister Su,

117
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,000
consider it carefully.

118
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Consider it.

119
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,160
I won't consider it.

120
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,160
I won't consider it, I won't consider it.

121
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,870
Slow down, slow down.

122
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
Slow down, slow down.

123
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,390
Walk slowly.

124
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,630
Walk slowly.

125
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,390
Is it necessary?

126
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,870
It's just a pregnancy.

127
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,390
It's as if I'm crippled.

128
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,360
Dear, you're very precious now.

129
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,120
Come, let me carry you.

130
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,630
What are you two watching here for?

131
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,870
Ah Wen, go buy some supplements for the General.

132
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,830
Yes.

133
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,950
Ah Xue, go and boil some
medicine to stabilize the pregnancy.

134
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes.

135
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,390
It's all your fault.

136
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,510
My mighty and domineering image is gone.

137
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,120
Dear, you're more than just mighty and domineering.

138
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
Your punch was earth-shattering.

139
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,680
Stop joking.

140
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,920
Come here.

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,390
Carry the sedan chair.

142
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,070
Yes, sir.

143
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,270
Dear.

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
This is fig soup.

145
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,190
This is jade white jade shrimp

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,630
and there's crispy honey porridge.

147
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,120
I made you a pregnancy-safe meal.

148
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,160
But if I eat this

149
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,870
how much weight will I gain?

150
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,950
What are you talking about?

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,680
My wife is naturally beautiful.

152
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,190
You'll look good no matter how fat you are.

153
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
Men's mouths are full of lies.

154
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,800
I don't believe you.

155
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,680
The ruler of the Southern Kingdom has her eyes on you.

156
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,390
If you don't serve her well,

157
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll send you to the Southern Kingdom.

158
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,070
Scared you, didn't I?

159
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,030
You want to get rid of me again.

160
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Not happening.

161
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,790
Xi'er,

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,870
My Xi'er,

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,720
I have a great-grandson?

164
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
Grandpa,

165
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,550
I must be dreaming.

166
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,550
Old man,

167
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,960
You're well-informed.

168
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,870
Of course.

169
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,750
Qingmo,

170
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,840
what's wrong with you?

171
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,270
I'm doing this to experience

172
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,840
the hardships of Lingxi's pregnancy.

173
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,030
I've been wearing it for a morning

174
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,960
and I'm almost exhausted.

175
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,630
Dear,

176
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,720
in the future, if you want to eat
or drink anything, just say the word

177
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,360
and I'll make it for you.

178
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Well done.

179
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,750
My judgment was right, wasn't it?

180
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,670
It's okay.

181
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,870
Alright, Qingmo,

182
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,440
don't make things difficult for yourself.

183
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,910
Take it off quickly.

184
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
All of you, open

185
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
the boxes.

186
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,510
This is a small token from your grandfather.

187
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,670
I don't know if you're carrying

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
a boy or a girl,

189
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,720
so I prepared everything.

190
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,750
From the time the child is born to adulthood,

191
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,390
I have prepared all the clothes.

192
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,600
Thank you, Grandfather.

193
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,200
Thank you, old man.

194
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,200
Young Master,

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,630
Young Master,

196
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,960
after you returned from the post house last time,

197
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,270
I sent someone to keep a close eye on the post house.

198
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,750
I received an intel.

199
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,240
The Sovereign of the Southern Kingdom
has secretly sent an elite force

200
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,840
who have disguised themselves as
ordinary citizens and entered the city.

201
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,120
More elite soldiers?

202
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,910
Could it be that she

203
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,960
is really plotting something with him?
