1
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 17

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,880
Miss.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,150
It's windy outside.

5
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,150
You can't catch a cold now.

6
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,920
Ah Xue.

7
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,670
Look.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,110
Isn't that star particularly bright.

9
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,760
That must be Grandpa.

10
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,280
Watching me from heaven.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,120
Miss.

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,230
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,590
The old general must hope that you

14
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,070
take good care of yourself.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Miss.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,510
Have you really parted ways with your husband?

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,560
He disappointed me too much.

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,400
Ah Xue.

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,840
From now on, there will be no
such person in the General's Mansion.

20
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,350
Is there still no news of Su Qingmo?

21
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,120
I don't want to talk about him.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,510
We've already severed all ties.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,510
Where he goes is none of my business.

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,590
Lingxi,

25
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,920
if there's some kind of misunderstanding between you,

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,230
then,

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,150
Alright.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,430
Then take a look and see if there's
anything you need to eat or use.

29
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,520
Just let me know.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
I appreciate it.

32
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,910
Lingxi,

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,280
Your Highness,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,310
Lingxi is feeling unwell today,

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,190
and is unable to receive guests.

36
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,310
Please return.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,120
Li Xiao, I am your elder brother, after all.

38
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,800
How dare you speak to me like this?

39
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,280
Have you forgotten,

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Your Highness,

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm fine. You should go back first.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Lingxi.

43
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,150
I brought you your favorite pastries.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Try them.

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,590
You still remember my favorite pastries.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,430
Of course.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,750
What do you like to eat?

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
What don't you like to eat?

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
I remember it all.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,080
Lingxi.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,120
The evidence in your grandfather's case is conclusive

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,960
I have repeatedly advised my father.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,310
Unfortunately.

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,310
I still couldn't save your grandfather's life.

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,240
I have been feeling very guilty since the incident.

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,750
Lingxi.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,560
Lingxi.

60
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,430
Let me take care of you from now on.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,000
My heart is dead.

62
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,430
I don't want to think about those things.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,120
Lingxi, I've always liked you.

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,870
You should've known that.

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,280
I originally thought that

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
I would let go after you got married.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
But now that you're like this,

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,910
How can I rest assured?

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,280
It's okay.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,030
I'll get better.

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
Lingxi,

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
It's getting late.

73
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
Your Highness, please go back.

74
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,920
Lingxi,

75
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,720
as long as you need me,

76
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,480
I'll always be here.

77
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,750
Where is this?

78
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,560
I know you're the Crown Prince's man.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,070
As long as you tell me the Crown Prince's plan,

80
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,190
I can spare your life.

81
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,240
If the Crown Prince hadn't saved me back then,

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,310
I would have died a hundred times over.

83
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Do you think I would betray the Crown Prince?

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
I won't kill you.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,750
On the contrary,

86
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,160
I'll let you go.

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,430
Tell me,

88
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,600
if your suspicious Crown Prince,

89
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,630
sees you return unscathed,

90
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,870
How will he deal with you?

91
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,600
Do you think you can kidnap me

92
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,870
and the Crown Prince won't know?

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
Did you sleep well?

94
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,560
Lord Su.

95
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,720
Did you kill Old General Mu?

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Of course.

97
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,390
If he didn't die.

98
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,560
How would you have been exposed?

99
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,430
Mu Lingxi

100
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
how would she have seen your true face?

101
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
Am I right?

102
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,480
Shadowless.

103
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,870
The dozens of people in the Mu family

104
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,070
all died by your hand.

105
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,040
If Lingxi knows the truth

106
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,390
she will definitely not let you go.

107
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,510
Of course she will know the truth.

108
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,390
It's just that

109
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,830
aprocessed truth is also the truth.

110
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,360
You despicable villain.

111
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,630
You can scold me as you like.

112
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,510
Wait until I get the throne

113
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,480
you and Mu Lingxi

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I will not spare a single one of you.

115
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,600
Su Qingmo, you have lost.

116
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,920
You will not succeed.

117
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,480
We'll see about that.

118
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,310
Brother.

119
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,800
Don't blame me.

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,040
You forced me to do this.

121
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,070
Greetings, Your Highness.

122
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,870
Lingxi, there's no need to stand on ceremony between us.

123
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,800
Besides, you're not one to be bound by formalities.

124
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,830
But now that we are ruler and subject,

125
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,560
we must observe proper etiquette.

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,270
Your Highness, please have a seat.

127
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,720
Lingxi.

128
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,670
You look much better today.

129
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
Thanks to Your Highness.

130
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,440
Lingxi,

131
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,080
Su Qingmo has been arrested.

132
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,390
This is his.

133
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,910
Keep it as a memento.

134
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,870
Arrested.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,120
He confessed everything.

136
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,390
Old General Mu was corrupt and accepted bribes,

137
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,600
all of it is his doing.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,670
He only wanted to get the Mu army.

139
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,200
Lingxi.

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,910
He deceived you for so long

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
and he killed Old General Mu.

142
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,080
Don't worry.

143
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,910
I will avenge you.

144
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you for telling me the truth, Your Highness.

145
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
You should throw away his jade pendant.

146
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,390
His things.

147
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,960
I don't want to keep any of them.

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,120
Lingxi,

149
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,080
I did all of this for you.

150
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
As long as you're happy,

151
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,910
I'll do anything for you.

152
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,670
Actually,

153
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,550
the day you gave me the lingzhi,

154
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,320
I knew your intentions.

155
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,510
Since my grandfather died

156
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,000
I've come to understand.

157
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
True love is

158
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,550
all a lie.

159
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,960
Only power

160
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
can protect our Mu family.

161
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,750
All along, it's only been you

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,270
who has been secretly good to me

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,840
and never pushed me.

164
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,080
Lingxi.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,390
Will you marry me?

166
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,390
I don't want to miss out again.

167
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,440
I do.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,630
Are you sure you're willing?

169
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,150
I can only be your concubine

170
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,030
and

171
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,600
I have one more request
