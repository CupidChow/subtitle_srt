1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 7

3
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,230
I thought this Wuying was some kind of big shot.

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,120
But he's nothing but a vulgar brute.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,000
All he thinks about is fighting and killing.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,480
When he saved me that time,

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,120
it was probably just a lucky shot.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,550
Look at his moves.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,830
I could knock him out

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,280
with one palm strike.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,790
Everyone in the martial arts world is talking about Wuying.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,640
But after meeting him yesterday, he's nothing special.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
Maybe all those rumors in the martial arts world

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,240
were just spread by people he hired

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,470
to hype him up.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,280
Wuying

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
is more like "incompetent".

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
I think.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,640
The name Wuying

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,670
shouldn't be a big problem.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,200
How can it not be a problem?

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,110
Look at him, he's definitely a fake

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,240
and the Shadowless

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,040
and the Thousand Soul Slash.

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,920
I'll go to the Pavilion of Whispers later

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,150
and spread the word that Wuying is a fraud.

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,950
throughout the martial arts world.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,430
Dear, that's not necessary.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
Killing someone is not a big deal.

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,310
You.

31
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,070
Why do you have to be so ruthless?

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,590
I said he didn't say anything about you.

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,710
Why are you defending him so much?

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,950
I...

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,350
I'll go think about what to have for dinner.

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,230
My husband

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,310
defending his love rival?

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,070
This is not right.

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,310
You're doing so much.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,870
Can the general finish eating all this.

41
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,400
Not all of it is for my wife.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,070
I have a date with my wife today.

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,590
Did you deliver the three letters I asked you to.

44
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,150
Yes.

45
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,230
Young Master

46
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,310
I think you've finally stood up for yourself.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Of course.

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,310
They've been messing around for so long.

49
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,870
It's time to show them who's boss.

50
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,400
Young Master, who exactly is that Wuying.

51
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,200
The general doesn't know

52
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,430
but you do.

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,590
Why don't you take this opportunity
to make things clear with the general.

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
No.

55
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,470
I can't tell my wife my identity.

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,150
She'll be safe if she doesn't know anything.

57
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,360
Young Master

58
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,470
I've noticed that you have

59
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,000
deep feelings for the general.

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,080
But after spending the last few days with you, I've realized

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
the general has feelings for you.

62
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,000
Of course.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,630
Did you give the things in the box to the shopkeeper?

64
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,630
Yes.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,710
He said he'd send news back in the next few days.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,840
He wants you to go to Zhijinji again.

67
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,240
Okay.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,030
Tell the shopkeeper

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
to hurry up.

70
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,280
That person might not be able to hold back any longer.

71
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,150
Young Master, what should we do next?

72
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,470
I had you send the letter

73
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,590
to test them.

74
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,430
Wuying's appearance was too coincidental.

75
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,150
It must be related to the crown prince.

76
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,000
If the crown prince really did it.

77
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
I won't let him get away with it.

78
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,960
Didn't they say they couldn't control him?

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,840
Then they...

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
Do you think the three of them are really united?

81
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,360
Young Master.

82
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you really not going to tell the general about this?

83
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,520
No need.

84
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,310
Lord Su.

85
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,120
You'll need Lingxi to help you get out of the carriage.

86
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,080
What kind of man are you?

87
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,400
I'll help

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,680
my weak and helpless husband getting out of the carriage.

89
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,080
If you don't want to get out on your own

90
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,680
then find a wife to help you.

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,560
Nevermind, it's not that bad.

92
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,400
Be careful, Lord Su.

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,520
Don't hurt your back.

94
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,400
Brother Lixiao

95
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,950
I prepared a lot of food for you.

96
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,190
See if you like it.

97
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,000
Let me see.

98
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,270
I like it, I like it.

99
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,510
Your Brother Lixiao is not picky.

100
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,870
Get lost.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,070
Really?

102
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,360
Wait for me.

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,390
Thank you, then I'll take it.

104
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Fresh beef

105
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,070
often requires the best heat.

106
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,120
With a special dipping sauce,

107
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,000
wait for the meat to turn golden brown.

108
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,830
A skewer of barbecue that can make the neighbor's child cry.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's ready.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Sounds good.

111
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
Why don't you come and grill it yourself?

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,750
Because

113
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I can't just watch

114
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,430
my wife eat by herself.

115
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,390
Thank you, dear.

116
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,430
Thank you, dear...

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,360
You're welcome.

118
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,000
Here, yours.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,070
Su Qingmo, isn't this a bit too much?

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,190
I usually eat delicacies from mountains and seas.

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,680
You're trying to get rid of me with this thing?

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,430
Are you kidding me?

123
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,190
If you don't want to eat it, forget it.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,560
Anyway, it's grilled by my wife herself.

125
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,120
Grilled by Xi Xi.

126
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,240
Made by Xi Xi herself.

127
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,630
I'm leaving.

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,070
Your Highness.

129
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,630
What are you doing here?

130
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,310
Nothing much.

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,190
Let me tell you.

132
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,480
Those two are dancing on the edge of a cesspool.

133
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,310
That's too much.

134
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,830
What did they do?

135
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,270
They actually asked me

136
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,430
as the richest man in the capital

137
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,390
grill skewers for them.

138
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
They're not grilling skewers.

139
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,720
They're stabbing my heart.

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,750
Why aren't you two watching Su Qingmo?

141
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
What are you doing here?

142
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,510
Plotting how to kill him?

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,240
I have an idea.

144
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,360
No, no, that won't do.

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,480
I can't drink anymore, I can't drink anymore.

146
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,800
I can't even outdrink you.

147
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,800
I lost.

148
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,630
Why are you sad?

149
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,040
It's just drinking, right?

150
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,070
It's not like that.

151
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,190
Lingxi and I have been together for so many years.

152
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,680
And I lost to you, a husband
who just dropped out of the sky.

153
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,600
My Lingxi!

154
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,680
What's this?

155
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,390
I've been beaten up for years.

156
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,390
And I still haven't won her heart.

157
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,480
All those precious healing potions wasted.

158
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,720
How could you be so pathetic?

159
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,270
Who's more miserable than me?

160
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,310
Who's more miserable than me?

161
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,270
I specially moved from the south of the Yangtze River

162
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,070
to the capital

163
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,630
just to take care of Xi Xi.

164
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,190
But what happened?

165
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,040
Not only did I not adapt to the climate.

166
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,510
But the threshold of my house was
broken by people proposing marriage.

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,560
In the end, I got nothing.

168
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,800
Why is my life so miserable?

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,680
Why are you so miserable too?

170
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,160
Stop crying.

171
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,270
From now on, I will take care of Lingxi for you.

172
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,310
Starting today,

173
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,680
you are all my good friends.

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,160
Come, let's drink.

175
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,800
Good friends...

176
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,600
Good friend!

177
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,360
You're too much.

178
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,360
You stole Lingxi from us.

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
It's too much.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,950
And you still make us your love bodyguards.

181
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,070
You're not human.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,270
Enemies in love become brothers.

183
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,270
This deal can't be done. It's not worth it.

184
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,750
It can't be done.

185
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,390
Dear you're here.

186
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Sit down.

187
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,360
Why did you drink so much with them?

188
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,320
Dear.

189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,910
How many times did you

190
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,030
speak up for me today?

191
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,960
You love me too much.

192
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,910
You wish.

193
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,000
I also want them to stay away.

194
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,080
They think I don't know what they're thinking.

195
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,480
Each with their own ulterior motives.

196
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,870
Using their love for me as a cover.

197
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,550
I will never.

198
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,360
Use my own love as a bargaining chip.

199
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,000
Either don't marry.

200
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,910
If I marry, I will marry the one I love the most.

201
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,750
Dear, you are already married.

202
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,030
You can't marry again.

203
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,440
Captain Xu, what brings you

204
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,870
to visit my manor?

205
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,480
What can I do for you?

206
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
General Mu,

207
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,360
We need to ask your husband

208
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
to come with us.

209
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,390
Please cooperate.

210
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,360
Do you have a warrant?

211
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,510
It happened so suddenly that the
document hasn't been signed yet.

212
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,440
You want to arrest someone without a document?

213
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,790
It seems that my manor

214
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,440
has become a lawless place.

215
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
Tell me, what happened?

216
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,150
We found Wuying's body in the outskirts.

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
The coroner said he died the night before last.

218
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,840
An eyewitness said

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Lord Su was the last person

220
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,790
Wuying saw before he died.

221
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,790
Nonsense!

222
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,750
We were together the night before last.

223
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,270
How could he have gone out to kill someone?
