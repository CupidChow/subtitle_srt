00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 9

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,550
Who sent you here?

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,320
A dying man doesn't need to know so much.

5
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,510
Miss.

6
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,150
Cousin.

7
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,430
Cousin, what's wrong with you? Cousin.

8
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Ah Wen, go find a doctor.

9
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,040
Okay.

10
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Ah Xue, go get the medicine box.

11
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,680
Yes.

12
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,070
Brother-in-law, what happened to my cousin?

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,680
She was attacked by an assassin
on her way to the military camp.

14
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,480
She was fine when she went to the military camp before.

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,070
Why did she encounter assassins today?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,760
Dear.

17
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,510
Run quickly.

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,680
Dear.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,590
You must wake up.

20
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,680
Don't leave me alone.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
He actually knows martial arts.

22
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,840
Master, what should we do next?

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Keep an eye on him and the people around him.

24
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,470
If there's any movement.

25
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,150
Report to me immediately.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,800
Yes, master.

27
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,190
Ah Xue has someone who likes her.

28
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,840
But I still can't get what I want.

29
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,240
No.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,190
I have to try harder.

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,520
As long as I work hard enough,

32
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,400
I can turn an iron rod into a needle.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,910
No matter how many times Brother Lixiao rejects me,

34
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,400
I will persevere.

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,190
I can do it.

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,030
I can do it.

37
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,870
Duoduo.

38
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,750
These are all for me?

39
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,910
Yes.

40
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,800
Look at this.

41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,720
This is from when you were one,

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
a rattle you can play with.

43
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,190
This is a comb you can use

44
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,560
when you grow up.

45
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,720
A folding fan.

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
And this...

47
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,480
A slingshot you can use

48
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,950
when you're being playful.

49
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,430
And these

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
I think these all suit you very well.

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
Brother Lixiao,

52
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,390
I missed all your birthdays before,

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,270
so I'm making up for it with all these gifts,

54
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,750
but it's not my birthday today.

55
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,270
Why are you giving me gifts?

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,040
Because,

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
because I know

58
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,870
you must be having a headache
over the recent floods in the south.

59
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,750
So I was thinking,

60
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
if what I do

61
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,680
can make you a little happier,

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,070
then I'll be very satisfied.

63
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
Brother Lixiao.

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I...

65
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,040
I really like you.

66
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,480
The other party has already taken action.

67
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,830
You must pay attention to your safety.

68
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,720
If you encounter danger, retreat first.

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,830
Protect yourself.

70
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,360
Thank you, Young Master.

71
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,800
I will definitely help you.

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,360
Collect all his evidence of guilt.

73
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,680
Oh, right.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,390
Help me with one more thing.

75
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,600
Find out their hiding place.

76
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,870
Yes, I'll do it right away.

77
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,560
Since they've shown their true colors,

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,360
don't blame me for being ruthless.

79
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,950
How dare you hurt my wife?

80
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,510
I'll make you pay.

81
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,190
Dear.

82
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,510
You're awake.

83
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,510
Does your wound still hurt?

84
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,270
It hurts.

85
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,680
Not only does it hurt.

86
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm also very hungry.

87
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,070
Wait a moment

88
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
I'll get you something to eat.

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,630
Dear, I want you to feed me.

90
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,160
Alright, I'll do as you wish

91
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,390
I'll go get something to eat first.

92
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,480
Dear, why are you up?

93
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,510
Are you okay?

94
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,750
Here, I just made it.

95
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,320
It's hot.

96
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
Then wait a bit before drinking it.

97
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,790
I remember there were assassins before I passed out.

98
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,790
How come you're home?

99
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,360
When I came back, Ah Xue told
me you went to the military camp.

100
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,360
I was thinking of bringing you some food.

101
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,960
Halfway there, I saw you passed out.

102
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,080
What about those assassins?

103
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,790
I didn't see any assassins.

104
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,790
I only saw you.

105
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,120
Alright, don't think about it anymore.

106
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,720
But...

107
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,600
Why did someone try to kill me halfway?

108
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Perhaps it was an enemy spy.

109
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,910
These few days, you should rest well at home.

110
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,390
Grandpa has already taken care of the military camp matters.

111
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,510
Don't worry.

112
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,390
Dear.

113
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,000
Smell this.

114
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,790
It's tasteless.

115
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,270
No.

116
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,030
This is the smell of freedom.

117
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,510
As if you're not free.

118
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,750
I haven't been able to leave the house since I got sick.

119
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,790
Of course I'm not free.

120
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,120
And you still make me so much delicious food every day

121
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,790
I've gained weight.

122
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,870
But I haven't seen you eat less.

123
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,200
Besides.

124
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,390
It's good to be a little fat.

125
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,790
That way, the three of them, including King Ning.

126
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,150
Won't fight over me.

127
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,910
Miss.

128
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,870
Miss, the Crown Prince is here.

129
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,320
Why would the Crown Prince come here?

130
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,870
Then I'll go and see.

131
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,440
Go.

132
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,840
Ah Xue, let's go.

133
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
Young Master, something's happened.

134
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,670
The shopkeeper was murdered.
