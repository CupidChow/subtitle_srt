00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 20

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,600
As long as you're dead,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,960
with or without the imperial edict,

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,830
I am the emperor

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,000
Father, I came to your rescue too late.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,560
Li Xiao.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,670
You're quite skilled.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,960
Even Song Jinghe couldn't hold you back.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,470
If I had known earlier,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,880
I should have let him kill you.

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,430
I know he was bought by you.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,750
I had already prepared for this.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,960
Give it up, Your Highness.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,320
You...

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,600
Didn't your tendons get severed?

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,560
I've disappointed you.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,000
Impossible.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,840
This is impossible.

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,680
I saw it with my own eyes.

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,350
Mu Lingxi severed your tendons.

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,150
You!

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,480
If His Highness hadn't sent someone

25
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,840
to follow that servant.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,950
This plan wouldn't have succeeded.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,510
That day in the dungeon.

28
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,480
Lingxi only cut my wrists and ankles.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,640
The imperial physician was also
arranged by His Majesty in advance.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
So you're saying.

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,430
You've known everything I've done for a long time.

32
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,200
You're just waiting for me to walk into your trap.

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,310
Su Qingmo, I underestimated you.

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,310
Brother.

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,680
We never thought of harming you.

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,480
Every step you've taken has been

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,590
your own choice.

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,040
Father values you so much, yet you repeatedly.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
Enough!

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,790
I have been cautious all my life.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,710
I didn't expect that

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,190
In the end, I still failed.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,280
I only regret,

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
regret not being able to hold on a little longer.

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,000
Letting you marry Mu Lingxi.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Mu family army, listen up.

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,870
Whoever kills Su Qingmo,

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,800
Li Xiao,

49
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,520
His Majesty,

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,150
will be rewarded with ten thousand taels of gold.

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,710
The tiger talisman is here.

52
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,150
I'd like to see who dares to make a move.

53
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,000
Time is of the essence.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,430
I could only get my hands on a
crudely made fake tiger talisman

55
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,470
to fool Your Highness.

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,680
It's just that His Highness was in a hurry

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,750
and forgot to verify it.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
The one I'm holding in my hand.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,680
Is the real tiger talisman.

60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
Without the Qingyue Sword.

61
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,120
How can you mobilize the Mu family army?

62
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,360
The Mu family army has always
only recognized the tiger talisman.

63
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,150
It has nothing to do with the Azurewood Sword.

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
Mu family army, listen up.

65
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,590
From this moment on

66
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,590
the Crown Prince is not allowed to leave the imperial study.

67
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
Yes.

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,470
He'er

69
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,870
Give it up

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,840
As long as you plead guilty

71
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,800
Your father won't punish you too severely

72
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,590
Father

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,870
You've told me since I was a child

74
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,000
As a ruler

75
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,190
one should keep one's word

76
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,400
Never give up

77
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,510
Now that I've lost, I've lost

78
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,870
How can I give up?

79
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,830
He'er!

80
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,310
Brother!

81
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,160
I didn't order the imperial guards to leave

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,630
I made this for you.

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
It won't cause allergies.

84
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,240
Then you have to put it on carefully.

85
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,560
Don't make me ugly.

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,310
My wife is naturally beautiful.

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,870
She looks good even without makeup.

88
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,830
Oh, right.

89
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,560
Prince Ning said he would come today to announce

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,950
the imperial edict to clear grandfather's name.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Hurry, so we don't miss it.

92
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,630
Don't move

93
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,190
or I'll draw a big mole on you later.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,000
You dare?

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,160
I don't dare, I don't dare.

96
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,390
General Mu has been cleared of his false charges.

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
You can rest easy now.

99
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,800
The innocent souls of the Mu family who died

100
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,870
can finally rest in peace.

101
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,680
If the Crown Prince knew about this in the afterlife,

102
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,600
I wonder if he would

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
regret his actions.

104
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,750
Your Highness,

105
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,480
how is His Majesty recovering?

106
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,360
Father has already passed the throne to me.

107
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,480
He buried my brother's tomb near the imperial palace.

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,510
He wants to guard my brother's tomb himself.

109
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,750
Then

110
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,430
what about Song Jinghe?

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,800
Exile to the northern desert

112
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,680
Never to return to the capital

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,000
What about you, Your Highness?

114
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,390
Me?

115
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,240
What's wrong?

116
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,510
Don't pretend in front of me

117
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,040
That night, when the Crown Prince
mobilized the Mu family army,

118
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,310
there was no time to transfer the imperial guards

119
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,040
Your Highness,

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
you instigated the palace coup

121
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,950
I did transfer the imperial guards

122
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,870
If I hadn't done that

123
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,040
My father and I would have died
at the hands of my elder brother

124
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
I was only protecting myself

125
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
Were you really only protecting yourself?

126
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,310
My grandfather died because of this

127
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Do you really not know anything about it?

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,310
I don't know.

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,870
It was because of this that I realized

130
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,360
my brother's ambitions extend beyond the throne.

131
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,720
So I pretended to be knocked out by Song Jinghe.

132
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,160
But in reality, I was secretly making plans

133
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,600
to make the Crown Prince let down his guard.

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,630
Lingxi,

135
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,310
in my heart, you have always been my friends.

136
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,270
Your Highness,

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,830
We husband and wife

138
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,040
are no longer willing to get involved in official matters.

139
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,390
We just want to live in seclusion and spend our days.

140
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,830
I hope you will treat the Mu family army well.

141
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,040
Don't let the soldiers lose heart.

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,750
Are you really leaving?

143
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
I know you all have reservations about me.

144
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,840
But time will prove everything.

145
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,750
Since you've made up your minds,

146
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,550
I won't force you to stay.

147
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,670
Mu family army,

148
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll take care of it.

149
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
Lingxi

150
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,270
Are you really not going to

151
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,600
Duoduo and Prince Ning's wedding?

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
No

153
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,550
The previous incident made me
unable to understand Prince Ning

154
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,320
I didn't want Duoduo to marry him in the first place

155
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,600
But she insisted on marrying him

156
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,960
I couldn't do anything about it

157
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,360
Oh well

158
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,080
If you're not going, I'm not going either

159
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
We'll just live a carefree life here

160
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,200
I want to eat pickled cabbage fish tonight

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,120
You make it for me

162
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,870
Okay, as you wish

163
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
I happened to have learned how to make a
whole fish banquet at the Men's Virtue Class

164
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,790
I'll show you my skills tonight

165
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,200
So,

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,960
besides the whole fish banquet

167
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,000
what else do you want to eat?

168
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,870
What do you mean by that?

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
It's...

170
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Do I need to say it?

171
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,790
Teaser.
