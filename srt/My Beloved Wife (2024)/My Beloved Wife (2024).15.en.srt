00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,752
My Beloved Wife

2
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,776
Episode 15

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,320
Miss.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,510
Protect the Crown Princess, Ah Xue.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,390
Miss.

6
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,430
Ah Xue.

7
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
Dear!

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Retreat.

9
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,230
Dear.

10
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
Will you plead guilty?

11
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,430
I will not plead guilty.

12
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,400
Even if you kill me, I will not plead guilty.

13
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't even think about using this to threaten Lingxi.

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,510
You didn't let her marry me back then.

15
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,280
Because you were afraid that I would have military power.

16
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,870
So even if it meant defying the imperial decree.

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
You still made her marry Su Qingmo.

18
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,190
General Mu.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,910
Your plan worked out perfectly.

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,430
You are not fit to be the Crown Prince.

21
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,750
General Mu colluded with the enemy country

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,120
and accepted bribes domestically.

23
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,960
He refused to plead guilty.

24
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,280
He should be executed according to the law.

25
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,430
As the Crown Prince.

26
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,960
I should share my father's worries.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
General Mu.

28
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,310
May you have a safe journey.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,910
Keep the evidence safe.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,150
Return to the palace.

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Yes.

32
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,480
Old man.

33
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,870
Get up.

34
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,630
Old man.

35
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,070
Don't scare me.

36
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,360
Get up.

37
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,830
Old man, don't scare me.

38
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,310
Don't leave me alone.

39
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,870
Can you talk?

40
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Old man, wake up.

41
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,870
Didn't you say

42
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,070
you would make me a rocking horse?

43
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,600
Right?

44
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Get up.

45
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,120
Can you hear me?

46
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,600
Grandpa, don't worry.

47
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
I will protect Lingxi.

48
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
Thousand Soul Slash.

49
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,560
So he's the Shadowless.

50
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,600
Who sent you here?

51
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
General Mu's injuries are not serious.

52
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,480
But the child cannot be saved.

53
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,150
My wife, you're awake.

54
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,910
Ah Xue, go get something to eat.

55
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,630
Quickly.

56
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,670
Grandfather's death.

57
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,440
Do you know something?

58
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,480
Tell me.

59
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,200
Just now, His Majesty issued an imperial decree

60
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,670
saying that General Mu is guilty of corruption and treason.

61
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,150
In consideration of the Mu family's military achievements,

62
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,030
he will spare your life.

63
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,910
Just now...

64
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,960
What about before that?

65
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,870
You clearly know martial arts.

66
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,080
Why have you been lying to me all this time?
