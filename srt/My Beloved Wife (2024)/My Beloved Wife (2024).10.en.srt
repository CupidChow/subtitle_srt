1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,602
You still want to protect me looking like this,

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,132
I'm more likely to protect you.

3
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,012
I'm so thirsty. I want some water.

4
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:08,092
Water.

5
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:08,772
Okay, okay.

6
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,722
I want some water.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My Beloved Wife

8
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:16,024
Episode 10

9
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,320
Miss, the Crown Prince is here.

10
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,282
The water is here, the water is here.

11
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,600
Why would the Crown Prince come here?

12
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:20,332
Come.

13
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,000
Then I'll go and see.

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,710
Go.

15
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,870
Ah Xue, let's go.

16
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:27,722
It's hot.

17
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,212
I want iced water, iced water.

18
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:31,092
Get me iced water.

19
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:31,802
Okay, okay.

20
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:32,572
Iced water.

21
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,390
Young Master, something has happened.

22
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,790
The shopkeeper has been murdered.

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,280
The murderer's methods

24
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:41,012
Iced water, iced water.

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
are identical to the ones used to kill Wuying.

26
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,070
It might be the same person

27
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,320
or the same organization.

28
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,390
Have his family settled in?

29
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,402
I want to eat a pear, eat a pear.

30
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,520
Yes.

31
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,162
I want to eat a pear.

32
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,920
I sent someone to

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
escort them safely to the north.

34
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:52,962
Eat a pear.

35
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,532
Where am I going to find a pear for you?

36
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
They should have left the capital by now.

37
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,402
Eat a pear.

38
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,430
It seems he has his eyes on us.

39
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,750
First it was my wife, then the shopkeeper.

40
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,802
Here, here, here. I finally found three pears for you.

41
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,040
I wonder who will be next.

42
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,640
Young Master.

43
00:01:08,252 --> 00:01:09,212
They're not peeled.

44
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,950
Should we really not tell the general?

45
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:10,602
I won't eat them if they're not peeled.

46
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:11,802
Go peel them.

47
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:12,922
I still have to peel them.

48
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:14,452
Peel them.

49
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:15,892
I won't eat them if they're not peeled.

50
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:19,572
Peel them.

51
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,200
He hasn't made any overt moves yet.

52
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:21,332
I'm peeling them, I'm peeling them.

53
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,040
We can't tell the general rashly.

54
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:22,332
Here.

55
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:24,162
They're peeled.

56
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,870
Let's wait and see.

57
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,452
Open your mouth.

58
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,230
Let's see what other tricks he has up his sleeve.

59
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:29,602
I can't bite them. You have to slice the pears.

60
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,132
Slice them.

61
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,350
By the way, have you found any evidence?

62
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:31,842
Go quickly.

63
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,962
Do you believe I'll slice you?

64
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,760
No, we haven't found anything.

65
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:34,132
Go quickly and slice them.

66
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,132
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

67
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,790
I'll go and have another look.

68
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,200
Yes, Young Master.

69
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:55,402
Here's the slice you wanted.

70
00:01:57,892 --> 00:01:59,452
I'm going to count to three.

71
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,310
Not in the drawer.

72
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:00,652
Three.

73
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,070
No secret compartments either.

74
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:02,692
Two.

75
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,350
Where could he have put it?

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
The one who conspired with him was

77
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,310
the King of Southern Kingdom.

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,910
Your Highness,

79
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,800
the Crown Prince has neglected his duties.

80
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,682
Su Qingmo!

81
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,042
You're pretending to be drunk.

82
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,590
You can no longer ignore the affairs of state.

83
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,030
Miss, you're back.

84
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,630
Look.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,910
These are all new clothes

86
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,360
the Young Master prepared for you.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
It's not like I don't have clothes to wear.

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
What a waste of money.

89
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,800
But.

90
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,190
The Young Master is doing this for your own good.

91
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,630
How can you blame him?

92
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,190
This isn't blaming him.

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,360
This is...

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
A sweet complaint.

95
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,800
You don't understand.

96
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,680
Where is the Young Master?

97
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
Why didn't he deliver it himself?

98
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,510
The Young Master went to the front yard.

99
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,040
He said he recently acquired two jars of fine wine

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,390
and sent them to the old general.

101
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,000
Why did he send wine to the old man?

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,830
The old man can't drink alcohol right now.

103
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,310
I'll go now.

104
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,240
Sweet complaint?

105
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,510
You're saying that someone secretly

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,630
sent someone to assassinate Xi'er.

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,040
That's right.

108
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,070
I observed the assassins' clothing.

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,160
If they were ordinary assassins

110
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,160
why would they be wearing

111
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,070
military boots that are only distributed in military camps.

112
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,720
Qingmo.

113
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,750
You must promise me

114
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,360
that you will protect Xi'er.

115
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,160
The current political situation is unstable

116
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,430
and various factions are eyeing the Mu family

117
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,800
and Xi'er.

118
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,600
That's why I had you two marry early

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,040
I was also afraid that someone would use Xi'er.

120
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,870
Don't worry, Grandfather

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,950
I will definitely protect Xi'er.

122
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,630
Old man, how dare you drink alcohol.

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,270
What did you tell her when you came out?

124
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,190
Delivering wine.

125
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm not drinking anymore. I can't handle it.

126
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,870
You must finish it.

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,630
Grandpa, I can't drink anymore.

128
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,920
If I let Lingxi know that I brought you alcohol.

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,310
Lingxi will definitely beat me up.

130
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,160
My dear grandson-in-law,

131
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
Listen to me.

132
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
If she hits you again,

133
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,750
you should

134
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,120
tickle her feet.

135
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,750
She won't dare to hit you anymore.

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,040
Tickle her feet.

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,160
Pour the wine. Pour the wine.

138
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,950
You're both so naughty.

139
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,040
Hot.

140
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,950
Behave.

141
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
So noisy.

142
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,190
Dear.

143
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,630
I will definitely protect you.
