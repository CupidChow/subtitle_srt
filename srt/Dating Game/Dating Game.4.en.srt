1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,760
If you want to woo someone,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,960
you need to get to their heart.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,840
The food he likes.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
The places he enjoys.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,160
It's good.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,240
Boss.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,360
It's urgent. Can you
come back to the office?

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,440
Curled up like a little worm.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,120
That's Boss.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,920
Yay! I completed the mission!

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,280
For the second mission,

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,760
Hill,

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,880
you have to hold his...

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,360
To hold...

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,000
Hold hands.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,280
Yuka-chan,

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,080
can I ask you something?

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,960
What do people usually do

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,160
if they want to hold someone’s hand?

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,120
Searching for information.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,160
People hold hands for many reasons,

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,960
greetings,

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,800
congratulations,

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,720
or offering help in different situations.

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,840
I mean like holding hands

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,280
as a couple,

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,000
like people who are dating.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
like people who are dating.

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Holding hands between lovers

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,520
can express many things

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
like care,

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,040
protection, or affection.

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,120
I think that if you're in a relationship,

34
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,720
holding hands happens very naturally.

35
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,120
Right.

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
It’s easy to say

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,080
but actually doing it is way harder, Yuka.

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,920
Besides,

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
Boss doesn’t even like me for real.

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,520
Then make him like you first.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,440
What?

42
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,280
No way.

43
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,880
This is just a job, Yuka.

44
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,200
My role with Boss

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
is to

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,120
go out and create scenarios

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,600
for the game so we can
make it more fun for players.

48
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,280
That’s all it is.

49
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,160
Understood. Ganbatte ne!

50
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
Would you like other information?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
Wait, Yuka.

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,760
Let’s return to the holding hands thing.

53
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,760
Aside from coming up
with the right scenario,

54
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,560
which I still have no idea

55
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,520
how to do it,

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,000
are there any other
things I should consider?

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
are there any other
things I should consider?

58
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,640
How your hands look and
how clean they are matters

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,920
when you're trying to
make a good impression.

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Nails shouldn’t be too long,

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,320
and hands should be
soft and pleasant to touch

62
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,760
with regular use of hand cream.

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
Mr. Phat,

64
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,640
we’ve got a problem.

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
There’s a fight happening!

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
Answer me! Who exactly did you invite?

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,920
It's me!

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,600
No, it's me!

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
What do you say?

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
I invited all of you.

71
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,480
Now, have a seat.

72
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,920
Let’s get something
delicious to enjoy, shall we?

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,200
Excuse me,

74
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
could you bring us the menu?

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
[stretching sound]

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
[stretching sound]

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,560
Hey, where did Bay go?

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,240
Oh.

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I heard he took a half-day off.

80
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Said he wasn’t feeling well.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Not feeling well?

82
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,480
Must be a woman.

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,560
Anyway, note that down in the

84
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,440
2D Artist department meeting for him.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,080
Got it.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,640
Hey,

87
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,400
can't you fix this?

88
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
Be half as diligent as me, will you?

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
Right here, quickly.

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
- I've told you several times.
- Everyone,

91
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
this is Ms. Jeans.

92
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,760
The one who designed Yuka.

93
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh? You know that?

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,760
Of course!

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,880
Ms. Jeans,

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,520
you’re famous.

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,120
Jeez, now I’m blushing.

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,520
Hill,

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,960
your voice totally changed!

100
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
[clears throat]

101
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Ms. Jeans,

102
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
it’s an honor to have you back with us

103
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
even though you're so busy.

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Since we usually have to
book you a year in advance,

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,600
there must be something
special about this project, right?

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,440
Not at all.

107
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,080
Really?

108
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
I only accepted this job

109
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,120
because Boss is my relative.

110
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,000
He both pressured
and begged me to take it.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,240
He both pressured
and begged me to take it.

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,360
Say something nice if
you're going to talk about me.

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,280
I asked you to do this

114
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,040
because you're the top 2D artist.

115
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,080
And for this project, I want only
the best in every department.

116
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,200
Sure.

117
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
Thanks for the compliment.

118
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,600
So you're Hill?

119
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,560
That's me.

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,160
You're alright.

121
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,880
Then

122
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,800
I’ll see you at my home studio tomorrow.

123
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Your home studio?

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,440
I need to observe behaviors
and gather inspiration

125
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,560
to design the character named Mike.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,800
Mike?

127
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,640
[sigh]

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
What?

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
You guys still don’t know?

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Was this a secret?

131
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,000
It’s fine.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,640
It’s fine.

133
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
I was planning to tell
everyone today anyway.

134
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,480
Mike is the main character

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,720
that's modeled after you, right?

136
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,720
Correct.

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Okay.

138
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,080
Boss, can I ask you something?

139
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,640
Why "Mike", though?

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,360
Isn’t it kind of plain?

141
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,960
Game characters usually

142
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
have more fantasy-style names, right?

143
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,120
I want our game’s main character

144
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,080
to be an ordinary guy

145
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,760
that anyone could fall in love with.

146
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
Wow.

147
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,760
Amazing.

148
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
That’s so deep.

149
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
Jun-chan,

150
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,640
if you want this game to turn out great,

151
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,760
you’ll have to cooperate, okay?

152
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,240
I told you, don't call me Jun-chan at work.

153
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,480
But I’m already used to it.

154
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
What can I do?

155
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
Can’t help it.

156
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,000
Besides,

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,560
Besides,

158
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
I think this game

159
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,880
shouldn't have just one main character.

160
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,080
What

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,480
do you mean?

162
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
Well,

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,000
everyone has their own type, right?

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Not everyone is going to fall for Mike.

165
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,000
So…

166
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
What do we do?

167
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
Let's see.

168
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
Hold on,

169
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
where’s Bay?

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Bay?

171
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,640
Yeah.

172
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,240
He’s chasing girls.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,280
Chasing girls?

174
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,720
Yes.

175
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Chasing girls, Boss.

176
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,600
What's that?

177
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,640
Well,

178
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,960
he said he was sick

179
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
but I think he's chasing girls.

180
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,560
I think this guy looks pretty good.

181
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,040
Good afternoon, Boss.

182
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,920
You called in sick,
you meant you couldn’t get up?

183
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,000
No, Boss. I did wake up with a headache.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
No, Boss. I did wake up with a headache.

185
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,080
I’ve got an important task for you.

186
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,120
Bring it on, Boss.

187
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Gather intel on how to win over this guy.

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
I’ve set him up as
the second character, Dylon.

189
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
And this guy will be our reference,

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Phat.

191
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,280
A Japanese exchange student.

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
The owner of Silver-Gold Table?

193
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,360
(Excuse me, could you bring us the menu?)

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,800
He's my friend.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,960
He's the head chef. This place
has been top-rated four years now.

196
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,600
Quite well-known. You know it?

197
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes, I do.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
But I doubt he knows who I am.

199
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,200
You can use the same
mission structure as Hill.

200
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
But I doubt my friend

201
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,280
would be easy to win over.

202
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,680
Do your best, Bay.

203
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,480
No problem.

204
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
I’ve already briefed Phat.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
I’ve already briefed Phat.

206
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,080
Just go to the restaurant.

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,240
Hey, what’s up?

208
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,840
There’s something
work-related I’d like your help with.

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,680
How can I help?

210
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,600
One of my staff will be there
tomorrow to gather some info.

211
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,960
I’m counting on you.

212
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,120
Alright.

213
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
Is the food ready?

214
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,000
In a moment.

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,320
Is the food ready?

216
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
It’s done.

217
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll take it.

218
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,440
Hey, Yuka.

219
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,920
Do you know who I saw today?

220
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,800
No, I don’t.

221
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,960
I ran into Jeans-chan.

222
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
Really?

223
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,640
Yes, Jeans-chan.

224
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,240
Who is Jeans-chan?

225
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,280
You don’t know her?

226
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,680
Searching for information.

227
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,840
There are 568 entries for ‘Jeans-chan.’

228
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,000
She's the one who designed you.

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,920
I have no data on a Jeans-chan who drew me.

230
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,280
No data?

231
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,040
That’s strange.

232
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
Would you like to keep searching?

233
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,480
No, that’s all for now.

234
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,640
I’ll get back to work.

235
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,800
Have a great day, Hill.

236
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,720
Ganbatte ne!

237
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,600
Thank you.

238
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
Oh.

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,520
How did you get here?

240
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
I followed you from work.

241
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
Wait,

242
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
are you stalking me?

243
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,720
I mean, you haven’t been answering my calls.

244
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,960
Look,

245
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
I’m working.

246
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,320
You didn’t think to check your phone?

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,480
Why?

248
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,880
Last night we were happy, weren’t we?

249
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,000
You're right.

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
You're right.

251
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
But I already told you,

252
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
no strings attached. Remember?

253
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
What do you take me for?

254
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,440
Say it.

255
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,520
Hey,

256
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,920
we’ve only known each other for a few days.

257
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,960
Calm down, Nan.

258
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
It's Anne.

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
My name's Anne.

260
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,040
Okay.

261
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,400
Anne.

262
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,280
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm not someone you can use and toss aside.

264
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,160
I never fooled you.

265
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,800
You think I'm easy?

266
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,520
No! Look,

267
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,280
What I said that night
before we had our fun,

268
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,440
you said you were okay with it,

269
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,560
didn’t you?

270
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,920
Disgusting.

271
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,920
You’re so selfish.

272
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,240
Someone like you

273
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,000
doesn’t deserve real love from anyone.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,760
doesn’t deserve real love from anyone.

275
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,600
That’s enough.

276
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,240
I’ve got limits too, you know.

277
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
Well, I’ve had enough of you too.

278
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,560
Excuse me,

279
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
could you please take this outside?

280
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,880
I hate you!

281
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
Don't bother me again.

282
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,720
Fine.

283
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,440
I won't.

284
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,000
What kind of cursed day is this?

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,560
What kind of cursed day is this?

286
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,080
Mr. Phat.

287
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,000
You are…

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,840
I'm Bay.

289
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,880
I want to apologize for
what happened earlier this evening.

290
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,560
Here.

291
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,840
I think

292
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,000
you should give those flowers

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,280
you should give those flowers

294
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,520
to the woman whose feelings you hurt.

295
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,680
Oh man,

296
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,000
I'd have to buy a hundred bouquets.

297
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,120
That' too much.

298
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,920
Hold on.

299
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,400
You see, I'm from PRISMSTAR Thailand.

300
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,960
You must have heard already.

301
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,480
Junji told me

302
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,880
he sent someone here for work.

303
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Is it you?

304
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,880
You got it.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,040
In that case, may I try to win you over?

306
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,600
Excuse me.

307
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,040
Have you been here long, Boss?

308
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,080
I arrived right on time.

309
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,960
Oh.

310
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm so sorry.

311
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,440
I've never been around this area before.

312
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,400
Coffee?

313
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm good.

314
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Thank you.

315
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,880
The coffee here is good.

316
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
I bought it from Italy.

317
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,760
I’ll make some for you, it won't take long.

318
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,000
Thank you.

319
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,800
Sit down.

320
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
what are you laughing at, Boss?

321
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,200
Is that seat comfortable?

322
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,160
Yeah, it's quite comfy.

323
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,080
Smells nice too.

324
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,840
Mission Two is to hold hands

325
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,520
with Boss.

326
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,360
Your hands are so pretty, Boss.

327
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,040
Well,

328
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,440
I mean

329
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
your fingers are long and elegant.

330
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,800
You must be good at playing the piano.

331
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,000
I guess,

332
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Just a little.

333
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,960
Why are you sitting there?

334
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,520
That is Khaojee's usual spot.

335
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,280
Khaojee?

336
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,920
Heh.

337
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,040
You two could probably be friends.

338
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,240
Hill.

339
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Get a little closer.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,160
Get a little closer.

341
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
Okay.

342
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,880
Feeling cold?

343
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,640
Well,

344
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,480
No.

345
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,080
Not at all, Ms. Jeans. I think

346
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm nervous.

347
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,480
This is my first time posing
for someone to draw me.

348
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,040
There’s a first time for everything

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,120
right, Jun-chan?

350
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,880
Almost done?

351
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,600
Not even close.

352
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,640
I’ve only finished one sketch.

353
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,320
How many do you need?

354
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,400
I don’t know yet.

355
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
Hard to tell.

356
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
As much as I can?

357
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
[sighs]

358
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,160
[sighs]

359
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
Don’t get grumpy, Uncle.

360
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,680
You want the best art for this, don't you?

361
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,480
I want to draw Mike in every movement.

362
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
Movement?

363
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,120
Yeah, movements.

364
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,440
For example,

365
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Hill’s posture right now

366
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,680
is super stiff.

367
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,320
I’m sorry!

368
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,680
I'm not scolding you.

369
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
How about this?

370
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,320
Sitting still for so long

371
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
must be boring.

372
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Let’s switch to taking photos.

373
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,720
Just thought of that now, you goldfish?

374
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
I’ll pretend I don’t understand
that sentence in Japanese.

375
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,720
I’ll pretend I don’t understand
that sentence in Japanese.

376
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,400
What did Boss say just now?

377
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,520
He always calls me a goldfish.

378
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
Hill,

379
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
do I look like a goldfish?

380
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,240
Exactly like one.

381
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,720
Not at all.

382
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,960
You’re cute,

383
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,440
just like Yuka-chan.

384
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,920
Of course.

385
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,280
I drew her myself.

386
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,280
Hill,

387
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
can you scoot even closer?

388
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,920
Got it.

389
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
Closer.

390
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
- There.
- Excuse me, Boss.

391
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,400
Closer.

392
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,280
Okay, just like that.

393
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,080
And hold the pudding, please.

394
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,960
- Hold the pudding?
- Yup.

395
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,000
Pretend you’re about to

396
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,240
feed Junji with that spoon or something.

397
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,680
Right.

398
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,200
Yes, great. That's it.

399
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,040
Like that. Hold still.

400
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,640
Boss.

401
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
Just like that.

402
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,600
Okay.

403
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,840
Good.

404
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,880
Jun-chan, focus please.

405
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,520
Good.

406
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Alright. Next, grab a drink.

407
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,160
Pretend you’re drinking together.

408
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,280
Boss, your expression.

409
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,800
Can you get closer?

410
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,720
Great.

411
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,640
Boss, look at Hill.

412
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,480
Okay.

413
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,600
Next shot.

414
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,480
Maybe popcorn? Hold the popcorn.

415
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,880
Nice.

416
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,400
Popcorn, popcorn.

417
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Mission Two is to hold hands

418
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,680
with Boss.

419
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
Now…

420
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,960
Hill, hold the popcorn and
lean your head on Boss’s shoulder.

421
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,920
- Alright.
- Good.

422
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
More.

423
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,080
Yup. Just lean on him.

424
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,680
I’m stiff.

425
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,920
Need to stretch.

426
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,240
Okay.

427
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,560
Yes, it’s me.

428
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
So, may I try to win you over?

429
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,120
Win

430
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,160
me over?

431
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,480
As in convince me to do something?

432
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,040
No.

433
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,360
Win you over

434
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,800
and make you my boyfriend.

435
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Wait a minute,

436
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,400
isn't this about work?

437
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,440
It is about work.

438
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,000
My boss gave me the task of

439
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,040
winning your heart.

440
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,000
You’re one of the references
we're using for a new character

441
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,480
You’re one of the references
we're using for a new character

442
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,920
in our upcoming game.

443
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,000
This is news to me.

444
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,880
I’ll explain.

445
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,120
No need.

446
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,360
Someone like you…

447
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,760
What about someone like me?

448
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,640
Forgive me.

449
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Even though we don't know each other,

450
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,840
in the past two days,

451
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,320
I’ve already seen enough.

452
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
You like

453
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,360
fooling around.

454
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
You're selfish.

455
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
I don't think someone
like you is fit to do this.

456
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,360
You’ve misunderstood me, Mr. Phat.

457
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
I had to do those things because

458
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,200
I knew they weren't the one for me.

459
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,840
I didn’t want to waste their time.

460
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
That’s why I was upfront.

461
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,280
I’m just an average guy who’s

462
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,760
searching for the right person.

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
Go back and tell your boss that

464
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,520
I’m willing to help with anything else

465
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,760
since we’re close.

466
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,960
But for this project, I’m out.

467
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,680
You’re still single, aren’t you?

468
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Don’t you get lonely?

469
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,680
No.

470
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,480
Give me a chance.

471
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,520
You know my boss well,

472
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,000
if I go back to report my failure,

473
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,360
I'll probably be fired.

474
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,960
That’s your problem, not mine.

475
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
At least let me prove myself.

476
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,200
To show you that I'm not fooling around

477
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,480
or, what was it?

478
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,480
That I'm selfish.

479
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Just talk to me,

480
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,400
please?

481
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,800
Alright, fine!

482
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,680
Thank you.

483
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,960
Hey, you!

484
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,040
Let me borrow your own words.

485
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,320
You’re not the person I’m looking for.

486
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,600
Don’t waste your time.

487
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,000
Mr. Phat, wait!

488
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,560
Mr. Phat.

489
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,960
Hey!

490
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,880
Khaojee, Khaojee.

491
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
Khaojee, look.

492
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,880
Khaojee.

493
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,760
Khaojee, Khaojee.

494
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,200
Khaojee.

495
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,640
Khaojee.

496
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,920
Sit.

497
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,080
Sit.

498
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
Sit.

499
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,880
What a good doggy! Good girl!

500
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay.

501
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,280
Okay.

502
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,640
Khaojee.

503
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,760
Let's try "lie down."

504
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,400
Is "lie down" correct?

505
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,960
Lie down.

506
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,000
Khaojee.

507
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,880
Lie down like this. Lie down.

508
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,040
Khaojee.

509
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,480
Lie down, lie down.

510
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,040
Come here first.

511
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,160
Lie down, lie down.

512
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,960
Like this. Lie down like this.

513
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,920
Lie down.

514
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,440
Let’s try again.

515
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,240
Khaojee, Khaojee.

516
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,480
Try this, okay?

517
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,960
Khaojee.

518
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,320
Hands?

519
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay!

520
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,360
Very good, very good! You deserve a reward!

521
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
Boss, look at this!

522
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,120
Hands!

523
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,720
Whoa. So good! So clever!

524
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,960
Khaojee! You’re so smart!

525
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,560
Boss.

526
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,880
Boss.

527
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
Try giving a command to Khaojee.

528
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,520
Try giving a command to Khaojee.

529
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,120
Boss.

530
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,480
Try asking for a paw.

531
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,520
I don’t like dogs.

532
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,200
Hey, guys.

533
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,920
I’m watching you both.

534
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
Try to act natural, will you?

535
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,240
Seriously, these two…

536
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,320
If we don’t create scenarios,
they’re completely useless.

537
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,200
How are we supposed to
make a realistic dating sim?

538
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,360
Come on, Hill. Try to be a bit smoother

539
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,560
or he'll catch on!

540
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,040
So they have to hold hands, right?

541
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,120
I knew it. Hill’s been
acting weird this whole time.

542
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,400
What do we do, Jeans-chan?

543
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,680
If this keeps up, our mission today is going to fail!

544
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,360
Hill, Jun-chan.

545
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,640
Take Khaojee out for a walk.

546
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,640
I want some outdoor movements.

547
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,920
Are you coming too, Ms. Jeans?

548
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,320
There's no need.

549
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
We’ve got a drone capturing every movement.

550
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,480
Shall we go, Boss?

551
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,360
Khaojee, let’s go!

552
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,720
Boss, do you not like dogs?

553
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,000
At first, I thought you'd be

554
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
At first, I thought you'd be

555
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,480
an animal lover.

556
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,080
What made you think so?

557
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,200
I see.

558
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,080
You're right.

559
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,680
Why is it?

560
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,440
But why don’t you like dogs, Boss?

561
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,160
Do you have some kind of traumatic memory?

562
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,560
Are you even afraid of them?

563
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,840
I don’t talk about personal matters.

564
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,600
I'm only doing this

565
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,000
for work.

566
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,000
Don’t forget,

567
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
I’m your boss.

568
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,960
Yes, sir.

569
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,680
Sorry, Boss.

570
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,880
Give it to me.

571
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,000
It’s okay, Boss.

572
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
It’s okay, Boss.

573
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,960
I’ll hold the leash.

574
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,320
I said give it to me.

575
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,320
It’s okay, I’ll hold it.

576
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,400
It’s fine, I’ll hold it.

577
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,800
It’s really fine, Boss.

578
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,040
- I...
- Give it.

579
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,720
[honking]

580
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,520
Hey.

581
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,920
Khaojee!

582
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,640
How’d it go?

583
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,560
Did it work?

584
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,720
Are you coming too, Ms. Jeans?

585
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,960
There's no need.

586
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,120
We’ve got a drone capturing every movement.

587
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
Okay. I'll stick to the plan.

588
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,440
Perfect. Khaojee darted off like lightning!

589
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,360
Now that’s what I’m talking about!

590
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,480
Khaojee!

591
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,040
Where did Khaojee go?

592
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,160
Let’s head back to the studio.

593
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,400
We can use a drone to search,

594
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,840
or maybe Khaojee

595
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,200
will find her way back.

596
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Really?

597
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,040
Yeah.

598
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,760
A call from Ms. Jeans.

599
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,480
Yes, Ms. Jeans?

600
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,280
So, how’s it going? Having fun?

601
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,360
Well, I saw Khaojee

602
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,840
running off, I thought

603
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,600
she was going back to the studio.

604
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,600
Don't tell me,

605
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,560
you guys lost Khaojee?

606
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,280
You could say that.

607
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,440
This is bad. Khaojee’s full of
energy and a bit dumb, too.

608
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,920
Really? I thought

609
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,640
Khaojee was pretty smart.

610
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,040
She only acts smart when treats are involved.

611
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,920
Khaojee once ran off for 10 kilometers!

612
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,640
Took me days to find her!

613
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,720
I see.

614
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,920
No way.

615
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,400
You two better find Khaojee,

616
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,840
or I swear I'll make you regret it.

617
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,880
Got it, Ms. Jeans.

618
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
Yes. I'll call you back.

619
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,960
Yes. I'll call you back.

620
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,760
We’re in trouble.

621
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,280
Khaojee!

622
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,440
Khaojee!

623
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,440
Khaojee!

624
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,520
Wow!

625
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,240
That was amazing.

626
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,760
Wonderful!

627
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
Which acting school did you go to?

628
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,360
That was top-tier!

629
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,480
Ching,

630
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
let’s stick to the original plan.

631
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,320
I’m telling you

632
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,720
if we put those two

633
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,240
in a tough situation together,

634
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,080
it'll lead to a touching moment.

635
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,320
Got it, Ms. Jeans.

636
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,880
- Khaojee!
- Khaojee!

637
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,360
Khaojee!

638
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,320
Khaojee!

639
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,080
Khaojee!

640
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Khaojee!

641
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,840
Khaojee!

642
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Oh no…

643
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,400
We’ve lost her and

644
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,200
I don’t think the two of us can find her.

645
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
I’ll call for help.

646
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,800
Who?

647
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,160
The police.

648
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
What? The police?

649
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
What? The police?

650
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,720
They’re busy, Boss.

651
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,600
They won’t come over to look for a dog.

652
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,200
[sighs]

653
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,720
You’re exhausted.

654
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,360
Today,

655
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
you can leave first.

656
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,920
No way.

657
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,640
We'll find Khaojee first.

658
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,800
Khaojee!

659
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,440
Khaojee!

660
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
I’m sorry for

661
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,000
letting

662
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
Khaojee get away.

663
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,400
No need to apologize.

664
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,600
Honestly, it’s kind of my fault too.

665
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,920
If I hadn’t…

666
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,520
Well, never mind.

667
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,400
It’s okay. I’ll hold the leash.

668
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,200
[dog barking]

669
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,480
Hill.

670
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,760
Did you hear that?

671
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,360
Ah.

672
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,920
I heard it.

673
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,000
[dog barking]

674
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,040
[dog barking]

675
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,280
Whoa!

676
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,240
Khaojee!

677
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,520
What are you doing up there?!

678
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,280
You crazy dog.

679
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,040
Khaojee!

680
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,080
Khaojee!

681
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,360
Boss.

682
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm here!

683
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,480
Look!

684
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
I got it.

685
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,000
Hang on, Khaojee!

686
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,000
I’ll climb up.

687
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
No, Boss.

688
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,080
I’ll do it. You stay right here.

689
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,520
That’s an order.

690
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,240
Really?

691
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,040
Be careful, okay?

692
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,040
Are you sure?

693
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,000
Boss, be careful!

694
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,800
Whoa!

695
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,520
Whoa!

696
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,040
[cheering]

697
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,600
They didn’t hold hands,

698
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,040
but an embrace like this

699
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,160
is good enough, right?

700
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,960
More than good!

701
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,000
But even though it’s good,

702
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,320
it’s still not the hand-holding we wanted.

703
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,120
Hill,

704
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,680
you must keep fighting!

705
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,440
The battery died.

706
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,320
The truth is,

707
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm afraid of dogs.

708
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,280
When I was a kid,

709
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,560
I tried to help a dog that got hit by a car.

710
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,560
But it bit me

711
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,680
and ripped my pants.

712
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,080
I got picked on for a while.

713
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,040
So I…

714
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
didn't want to tell others about it.

715
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,000
I think everyone

716
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
has parts of their past

717
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,200
they don’t want others to know.

718
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,240
But in the end,

719
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,520
it’s up to us

720
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,680
to learn

721
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,160
how to move on

722
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,520
so the past doesn’t

723
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,920
come back to hurt us again.

724
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,760
Khaojee.

725
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,520
Come here.

726
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,440
Right, Kaojee?

727
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,560
I’m not scary, right?

728
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,000
Right?

729
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,520
Whoa!

730
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,400
Damn it. Why didn’t I just
ask to hold his hand back then?

731
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,720
To show my appreciation,

732
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,000
or even a thank you.

733
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,000
Right, Yuka?

734
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,320
Shoot.

735
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,720
When did the battery die?

736
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,800
I totally forgot.

737
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,440
Green curry’s ready.

738
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,920
Did Bay pay you a visit?

739
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,160
But don't send anyone else.

740
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm not keen on this kind of stuff.

741
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,680
Why?

742
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,480
Did he do something

743
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,840
to upset you?

744
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,520
Hey, you!

745
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,200
Let me borrow your own words.

746
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,640
You’re not the person I’m looking for.

747
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Don’t waste your time.

748
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,800
Well,

749
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,800
a lot of things.

750
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,760
It's just this project.

751
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,000
I can’t help you with it.

752
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,600
I can’t help you with it.

753
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,520
Find someone else.

754
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,320
You didn't wait for me.

755
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,760
You followed me.

756
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,680
I didn’t ask you to join me.

757
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,680
I called. That counts as asking.

758
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,800
What are you staring at?

759
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,080
Mike.

760
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,400
But the Mike I designed
wouldn’t be here eating green curry.

761
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,840
What’s wrong with green curry?

762
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,680
How do you feel today?

763
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,560
Why are you asking?

764
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,480
Your job

765
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,240
is to design characters.

766
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,400
Hey!

767
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,760
To design a character well,

768
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,160
I need to understand
their emotions and feelings.

769
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,960
You got tons of photos.

770
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,760
Just use that.

771
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,720
I want to hear it from your mouth.

772
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,880
What do you want to know?

773
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,680
I want to know if I was right.

774
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,120
I’ve been watching you all day.

775
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,400
Jun-chan,

776
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,320
you’re scared of dogs, aren’t you?

777
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,920
I remember.

778
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,560
When we were kids,
a dog bit you on the butt.

779
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
That’s why you’re still traumatized, right?

780
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,600
It didn’t bite my butt.

781
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,760
You remember wrong, you goldfish.

782
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,520
Love’s the same as being scared of dogs.

783
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,000
You’ll get over it one day.

784
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,320
You’ll get over it one day.

785
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,160
If you can stop being afraid of dogs,

786
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,760
Then you can also overcome

787
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,520
your fear of love and start over again.

788
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,240
Wait, how are those related?

789
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,880
I think

790
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,760
Hill’s really sincere.

791
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,440
Don’t you agree?

792
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,560
What do you think of Hill?

793
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,200
Do you like him?

794
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,200
If you like Hill,

795
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,120
go ahead and hit on him.

796
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,040
Be my guest.

797
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,960
Hello, Boss.

798
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,560
What did you do

799
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,200
to make Phat that upset?

800
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Well,

801
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,000
I just flirted with him like usual.

802
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,040
I just flirted with him like usual.

803
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,400
You sure about that?

804
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,200
Come on, Boss.

805
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,680
You know that

806
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,000
he's not the type to
fall for someone that easily.

807
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,880
Find a way to fix it fast.

808
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,960
Otherwise, I’m marking

809
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,720
this mission as a fail.

810
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,040
Wait, Boss.

811
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,800
Boss!

812
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,120
It was just the beginning!

813
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,040
Damn.

814
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,680
Shoot.

815
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,960
Damn it!

816
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,720
Why the hell did I do that?

817
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,640
Ugh.

818
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,240
I want to apologize

819
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,160
for kissing you the other day.

820
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,560
Can you forgive me?

821
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,840
I won't give up.

822
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,200
Junji is going to have a new love.

823
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,360
Isn't he cute?

824
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,040
This young new employee.

825
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,560
Then

826
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,280
will you let this opportunity go?

827
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,640
Yuka-chan is modeled after Jeans.
