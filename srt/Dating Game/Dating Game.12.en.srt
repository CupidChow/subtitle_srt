1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,560
And this is "ETERNAL Kizuna."

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,560
Congratulations.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,440
The game we poured our hearts into

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,240
has succeeded

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,800
beyond our expectations.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
I’ll create a character based on me,

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,360
named Haruki.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,160
Headquarters in Japan

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,160
asked me to return for their big project.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,280
Phat.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,200
Not a day went by without thoughts of you.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,080
Now I know

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,800
how important you are to me.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,080
Junji.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,120
You okay, Junji?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,640
Hey…

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,840
We talked about this.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,520
When it's time to part ways,

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,040
we wouldn’t cry.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,400
At first…

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,240
I thought I could do it.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,280
But…

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,680
Now that it's happening,

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
I can't.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm not as strong as you are.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
Don't be like that.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,800
Don't cry, Jun-chan.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,640
I promise

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
I'll fly over

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,640
to Japan whenever I'm free.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,360
Okay?

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,920
Thanks, Jeans.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,360
And…

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Don't worry about Hill, Boss.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
He's in good hands.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,080
Not a single scratch on him.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,200
I'll take him out every night

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,600
so he won't ever feel lonely.

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,640
Ouch!

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
I was joking. I wouldn't dare.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,560
I think

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
you're not crying

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
because you'll be far from Hill.

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,720
But because

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
you can't eat the green
curry at my place anymore.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Am I right?

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,920
Really?

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Is that so?

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,840
Maybe.

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,480
Anyway,

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,880
Safe travels, Boss.

52
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,080
Thanks.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
Don't cry.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm not.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
No more tears.

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Don't cry.

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,520
- I'm not crying.
- Right.

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,440
Let's go.

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,960
Bye-bye.

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
I'll help.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
I hope your project goes well.

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,040
I'll always be cheering you on.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Just like how Yuka

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,000
always supported me with her smile.

65
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,120
Ganbatte ne!

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,920
Take care of yourself

67
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,360
while I’m gone.

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
Drink lots of water

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
when you eat those pork skewers.

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
Got it.

71
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
And you too.

72
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,320
Take care of yourself.

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,800
Get plenty of rest.

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
And…

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,880
While I'm here,

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,400
I will…

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
make sure I finish Haruki on time.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
make sure I finish Haruki on time.

79
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Promise me

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,640
we’ll say goodbye

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,880
together on Yuka’s last day.

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,640
I promise.

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,800
Junji.

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,120
Junji.

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,800
Hill.

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
Junji.

87
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,960
(Three months later)

88
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,640
Ohayo (Good morning), Hill.

89
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,040
Ohayo, Junji.

90
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,560
You can go back to sleep.

91
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,160
It’s still early in Thailand.

92
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,480
You also went to bed late last night.

93
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,400
No way.

94
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,320
How could I?

95
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,920
You're not here with me, Junji.

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,040
Alright, fine.

97
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,480
Go take a shower.

98
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
Stop talking.

99
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,400
Right, go shower.

100
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,960
Hill.

101
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,800
Hill!

102
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,040
What are you doing?

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,440
Undress in the bathroom!

104
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,960
They'll see everything.

105
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,720
Ta-da!

106
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,880
Want some?

107
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,200
Man…

108
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,640
You're making me want to
go back and have some.

109
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,920
If you come back today,

110
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,800
I'll buy you a hundred sticks.

111
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,240
Here.

112
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,000
Open wide.

113
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,760
Get some rest, Hill.

114
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
You could faint.

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,240
But work's not done.

116
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,000
I want to finish it first.

117
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
I’m so tired, Junji.

118
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,920
Give me some encouragement.

119
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,280
No, work until you drop.

120
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,600
So stubborn.

121
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,080
Just a bit, please?

122
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,120
Junji.

123
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
It's so late. You're not afraid of ghosts?

124
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,280
Boo!

125
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Ghosts?

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,440
Save that for the kids.

127
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
I just don't want you to stay up late.

128
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,840
You always work so hard.

129
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
It's been tough lately

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,320
It's been tough lately

131
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
because we just started.

132
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,560
But I already got a team to help.

133
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
Soon, it’ll be more manageable.

134
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,720
[sighs]

135
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,760
I miss green curry and pork skewers a lot.

136
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,280
So,

137
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,920
you only miss the food?

138
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
Not anything else?

139
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,200
Besides food,

140
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,400
I miss…

141
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh!

142
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,560
Tourist spots.

143
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,960
I still have many places in Thailand to visit.

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Chiang Mai is pretty.

145
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
Phuket is also great

146
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
for scuba diving.

147
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
The Full Moon Party in Phang Nga.

148
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
But,

149
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,280
what I miss the most is…

150
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,680
Hey.

151
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,400
You fell asleep?

152
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
You must be

153
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
exhausted as well.

154
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
I just want you

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
to take care of yourself.

156
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Especially when I’m so far away.

157
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
I…

158
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,280
I miss you, Hill.

159
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,400
I…

160
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,240
I really miss you.

161
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,080
(Babe, what do you want for lunch?)

162
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,160
(Something hot. How about mala skewers?)

163
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,480
(Mala may be hot, but not
as hot as me. Tee-hee!)

164
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,840
Geez.

165
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,760
You’re only a few steps apart and

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
you're still texting each other?

167
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,720
Alright, everyone.

168
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Gather around.

169
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Hello, everyone.

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,280
Hello, everyone.

171
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,520
- Hello, Boss.
- Hi, Boss.

172
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,240
Are you well, Ms. Secretary?

173
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,120
How's the new boss?

174
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,080
Boss Pao is way stricter than you.

175
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
[laughs]

176
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,560
Come on, Boss.

177
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,840
It's only temporary.

178
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,800
Soon, they'll send someone to replace me.

179
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
That'll take a while.

180
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,320
They won't find someone that quickly.

181
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,320
And you seem like a good fit for the role.

182
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,320
You mean it?

183
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,800
Don't flatter me.

184
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,520
Anyway,

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,680
I'll boot up the PC for your remote access.

186
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,280
I've shared the livestream
schedule prep with the fans,

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,200
through PRISMSTAR TH Channel Online,

188
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,040
as you've requested.

189
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Under the topic of

190
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,320
online game development in Japan.

191
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,760
Thank you, everyone.

192
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,560
Alright.

193
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,600
Back to work.

194
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,080
Go on.

195
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,760
I saw that, dear.

196
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,400
Aren't you going back to work?

197
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,600
I'm just looking ahead, to where…

198
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,280
our company's future is.

199
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm not at the office.

200
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm at Phat's place.

201
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,960
What's up, Hill?

202
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,560
I haven't seen you in days, bro.

203
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,600
Thought you'd quit and become a chef.

204
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,160
You little…

205
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,040
Now you're teasing me.

206
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,760
I'm here because of

207
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,880
the new project.

208
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,640
It's a restaurant simulation game.

209
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,680
So, I have to do my research here.

210
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,640
And how's that coming along?

211
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,920
Still in the research stage.

212
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,920
That's dope.

213
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,800
Is it the data you sent me?

214
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,160
All those restaurant ingredients looked amazing.

215
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,960
I think you should add

216
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,200
150 more vegetables.

217
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,960
Dylon works at a Japanese restaurant.

218
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,160
Stop messing around, dude.

219
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,160
Ugh.

220
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,960
Ready?

221
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,760
Hang on, let me get the gloves.

222
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,080
These are such a pain.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,680
Ah…

224
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,080
Here.

225
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,400
Pull.

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
Okay, all set.

227
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,080
Before we make sashimi,

228
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,560
we need to slice the fish first.

229
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,120
Ready, Chef Bay?

230
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,320
Ready, Chef Phat.

231
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,120
Mwah, mwah.

232
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,720
Quit fooling around.

233
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,360
Focus.

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,240
Here, start slicing.

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,920
How?

236
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,600
I literally just showed you.

237
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,240
Right.

238
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
More diagonally.

239
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
- That's good.
- Like this?

240
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,040
Too thick.

241
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,360
What? Still too thick?

242
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,400
Seriously.

243
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,360
Okay.

244
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
Good.

245
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,160
Ow!

246
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,720
Did you cut yourself?

247
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Maybe.

248
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,720
Ouch!

249
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,480
Stop messing about.

250
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:52,920
Come on.

251
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,720
Focus.

252
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
A little encouragement?

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
Just hurry up.

254
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,320
I got it. I'm done!

255
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,000
See?

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,280
See?

257
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,120
There.

258
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,800
It's finished. Where's my praise?

259
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,080
Good.

260
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,400
Do I get a reward?

261
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
What reward?

262
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,280
But we're packed today.

263
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,360
It's fine, we just need to adjust a bit.

264
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,640
Quick.

265
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,440
That's it.

266
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
The camera's rolling, you know?

267
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,960
Careful.

268
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,000
You’ll knock over the glasses.

269
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,400
Oh, man.

270
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,040
Ta-da!

271
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
Perfectly done.

272
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
Well? Check it out.

273
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,520
How is this perfect?

274
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,160
It’s wrong.

275
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,200
But I did as you said.

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,160
I copied yours.

277
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,880
No, that's not right.

278
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,840
Sitting here,

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,480
the placement

280
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,960
is in this order, right?

281
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,120
For this side…

282
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,960
you have to arrange in the same order.

283
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,080
Spoon's of the left.

284
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,480
But you put it on the right.

285
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,320
They're a lefty.

286
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
No.

287
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,840
See?

288
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,040
You talk back every single time.

289
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Sorry.

290
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,680
But,

291
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,040
there's no need to shout.

292
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,840
You're the reason I had to.

293
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,160
Come on.

294
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,800
Hurry up.

295
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,320
Switch them.

296
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,120
Softer, will you?

297
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,920
That’s not right.

298
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,000
The knife should go on the inside.

299
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,720
Ugh.

300
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,800
Why so difficult?

301
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,680
It’s all cutlery.

302
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,360
Make sure the wine glass
is at an angle.

303
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,120
That'll make it easier to grab it.

304
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,800
- That'll make it easier to grab it.
- Wait.

305
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,760
Forty five degrees?

306
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,520
Yes, here.

307
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
You tricked me again.

308
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,560
Do it yourself.

309
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,560
Ugh.

310
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,000
- Like this? Good?
- Yeah.

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,680
That's right.

312
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,040
- Finally.
- Good.

313
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,760
What’s next?

314
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,640
Where’s the napkin?

315
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,680
Huh?

316
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
I told you already.

317
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,400
Where is it?

318
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
I don't know. How could I know?

319
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
I sent you a list of things to prepare.

320
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,000
- But it’s your place.
- Go.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Doesn't matter.

322
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Which hair color

323
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Which hair color

324
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,720
would suit Haruki?

325
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,280
I'd say gray.

326
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,360
Or silver.

327
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,080
It's a nice contrast to Yuka's pink hair.

328
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
Okay, let's see.

329
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,080
Let's go.

330
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
[background chatter] Gray, like this.

331
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,920
[background chatter] Yeah.

332
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
[background chatter] Looks good.

333
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,920
And this outfit.

334
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,000
[background chatter] Try white.

335
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,640
[background chatter] Too pale.

336
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,280
I have an update to share with you all.

337
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,000
[background chatter]

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
I think blue might be better.

339
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
- We can try.
- Yeah, try it.

340
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
That'll match the outfit.

341
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
Also Yuka's pink hair and outfit…

342
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,240
Can we change the mountain to the sea?

343
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,880
Sure.

344
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,720
Yeah, and…

345
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,360
I have an announcement

346
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,320
about bonuses.

347
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,960
Now, now.

348
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,880
Cat got you all's tongues now?

349
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,480
Come on.

350
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,840
So, what about the bonus?

351
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,960
I'm excited.

352
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
About the bonus I just mentioned,

353
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,240
there is…

354
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,280
Well,

355
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,440
There's no update yet.

356
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
- The show's over.
- Real smooth, man.

357
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
- What's his problem?
- Slick.

358
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm not done.

359
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,760
Because this is

360
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
extremely important.

361
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,760
I believe many of you already noticed.

362
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,040
Within our game,

363
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,600
many players

364
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,240
have maxed out their levels.

365
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,680
In other words,

366
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,120
our game has hit a wall.

367
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,520
So the company wants to make a "Bonus Stage".

368
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,640
And the Game Designer who will

369
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,280
plan

370
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,240
and present it

371
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,680
is none other than…

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,080
None other than

373
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,920
the one who created Mike.

374
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,040
That's you, Hill.

375
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,200
[cheers and applause]

376
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,480
Congratulations, Hill.

377
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,280
[cheers and applause]

378
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,520
He's the perfect fit for this.

379
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,400
Good luck!

380
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,920
Thanks.

381
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,760
You’re the chosen one.

382
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,960
And you'll be presenting

383
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,400
at the headquarters in Tokyo.

384
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,280
What?!

385
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,800
Yup.

386
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,760
In Japan?

387
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,720
- Correct.
- Yeah.

388
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,960
And you only have this week to prepare.

389
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,200
Your flight's next week.

390
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,360
Wait a minute.

391
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,280
We're shutting down

392
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
Yuka's game this week, right?

393
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,520
Haruki's design isn't done yet.

394
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,440
Headquarters in Tokyo

395
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,640
wants you to take on this role.

396
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,280
Yep.

397
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,840
As for your schedule,

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,880
that's your problem.

399
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,720
Right.

400
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,440
You might have to say
goodbye to Yuka in Japan.

401
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,040
Now you must be worried

402
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,760
about how to prepare for it,

403
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,320
right?

404
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
You'll get helpers.

405
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,320
We'll assign you three coaches

406
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,800
to train you before you go to Japan.

407
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,360
Yeah!

408
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,600
And…

409
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,880
Who are the these coaches?

410
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,440
[laughs mischievously]

411
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,800
As your first coach,

412
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,360
I'll help with the Bonus Stage.

413
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,200
You will?

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Let's see.

415
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,720
The players

416
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,000
must win over Mike's mom and sister?

417
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
must win over Mike's mom and sister?

418
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Both of them have traumas with love

419
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,640
and are against Mike dating.

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,960
Sounds good?

421
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,640
Why does that sound so…

422
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,440
so cliché?

423
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,840
Cliché?

424
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,840
Yeah.

425
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,720
Damn, cliché?

426
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,960
If that's too cliché,

427
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,760
then…

428
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
What you just recited

429
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
were simple phrases

430
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,040
that'll help you get by in Japan.

431
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,440
Alright, one more time.

432
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,880
Got it.

433
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,440
Where's the train station?

434
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,880
Where's the train station?

435
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
I lost my wallet.

436
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,920
I lost my wallet.

437
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,240
I'm lost.

438
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm lost.

439
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,520
Excellent.

440
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
You memorized them so quickly.

441
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,440
Well,

442
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,840
I did some homework as well.

443
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,720
Really?

444
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,240
Then tell me what you know.

445
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
So…

446
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
From what I can remember…

447
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,840
Me means eyes.

448
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,400
Yes.

449
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,080
Legs is Ashi.

450
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
Mimi means ears.

451
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,120
Buta means pig.

452
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,160
Kani means crab.

453
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
Inu means dog.

454
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,960
Iku means to go.

455
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Kuru means to come.

456
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,520
Ocha means tea.

457
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,040
And Kohi means coffee.

458
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,800
Teehee!

459
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,120
Very good.

460
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Impressive.

461
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,640
Nah, come on.

462
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,280
I got it from TikTok.

463
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,520
By the way,

464
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,120
I have a favor to ask.

465
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,040
What is it?

466
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Well…

467
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,840
I'd like you

468
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,720
to teach me a dish to win Junji's heart.

469
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,000
I see.

470
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,240
I see.

471
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,680
That'd be green curry.

472
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,360
You scared me for a bit there.

473
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,120
I'll do it.

474
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,760
Thank you.

475
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,360
- It's boiling.
- Just a second.

476
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,800
Done.

477
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,760
Chillies.

478
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,880
Okay.

479
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,120
Next is meat.

480
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,600
Yes.

481
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,360
Add meat first, right?

482
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,800
Yes.

483
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,520
Meat.

484
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,920
Okay.

485
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,200
Do you remember what to add next?

486
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
Eggplants?

487
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,080
I remember.

488
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,080
Eggplants.

489
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Wait up.

490
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,440
You have to tear them first.

491
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,200
- Tear them.
- Tear them?

492
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,680
- Yes.
- Tear them?

493
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,240
Otherwise it won't be fragrant.

494
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
- Like this?
- Yeah.

495
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,120
Good.

496
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
Okay.

497
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,960
A bit smaller.

498
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,880
Good.

499
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,440
Hm…

500
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:28,920
Wow!

501
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,440
Not bad at all

502
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
for your first try.

503
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
Well, it's your recipe.

504
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,200
It must be good.

505
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,880
Careful.

506
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,000
Is it cooked?

507
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,280
- It's cooked.
- Nice.

508
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Careful, it’s hot.

509
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,440
Nom, nom.

510
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,920
Oh!

511
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,320
Hoh! (hot).

512
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,440
Damn.

513
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,240
That's too many layers!

514
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,400
You're not going to a snow town.

515
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,360
But.

516
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,000
Isn't it cold in Japan?

517
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
Isn't it cold in Japan?

518
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,400
I don't want freeze to death.

519
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,680
You're there for the presentation.

520
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
You need to stand out

521
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,680
to leave a lasting impression.

522
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,760
Oh.

523
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,040
That one will catch their eyes.

524
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,160
But it lacks credibility.

525
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:18,960
What?

526
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,880
This one will do.

527
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,080
This is the one.

528
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,720
It's perfect for you as a Game Designer.

529
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,720
So handsome.

530
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,080
Thank you, Ms. Jeans.

531
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,920
Hill.

532
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,800
Here, a gift for Boss.

533
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,680
This will remind him of Thailand.

534
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,200
Take it.

535
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,480
The elephant pants?

536
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,000
What's wrong?

537
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,480
This is Thailand's soft power, you know?

538
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,160
Got it?

539
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,680
Alright.

540
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,400
Make sure you don't lose it, okay?

541
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,680
- Thanks, Bay.
- Don't forget.

542
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,360
Take this.

543
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,040
It's the best.

544
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,480
Best gift from Thailand.

545
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,080
Durian.

546
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,520
Hey!

547
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,120
Durian?

548
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,400
I can't bring it on the plane, Pao.

549
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,720
I know that!

550
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,280
I'm not that dumb, dude.

551
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,920
It's dried mango.

552
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,440
A Premium grade one.

553
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,640
Once he had some,

554
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,880
he'll surely miss Thailand.

555
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,400
I see.

556
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,720
Alright, thank you.

557
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
When you meet Junji,

558
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
use that irresistible recipe.

559
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
And safe travels.

560
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,480
Got it.

561
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,040
Thank you.

562
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,240
Send my regards to Jun-chan.

563
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,000
Is Jun-chan picking you up at the airport?

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
Is Jun-chan picking you up at the airport?

565
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,480
He's probably working.

566
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,800
We haven't talked much.

567
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh.

568
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,760
It’s almost time.

569
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,280
Alright.

570
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,160
Yeah, go on.

571
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
- Thanks, everyone.
- Have a safe trip.

572
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,240
- See you!
- Safe travels.

573
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,600
- We'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, man.

574
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,720
- Keep in touch.
- Bye!

575
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,280
- Will do!
- Go.

576
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,960
Which counter?

577
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,520
I'll go with you.

578
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,320
Hello.

579
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,760
May I see your passport?

580
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,000
Passport.

581
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,800
How’s everything? All good?

582
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I’m fine, Junji.

583
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,280
But where are you now?

584
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,200
At the office?

585
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,440
I'm outside the meeting room.

586
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,720
You know, I'm more excited

587
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,240
to see you than anything.

588
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,880
Hill.

589
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,400
About today,

590
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,600
I won't be at the meeting.

591
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,040
Something came up.

592
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,280
Really?

593
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,400
That’s okay.

594
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,160
Are we

595
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,480
going to say goodbye
to Yuka together tonight?

596
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Sorry.

597
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,440
I have important work to do tonight.

598
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,040
So, I can't say goodbye to Yuka with you.

599
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,080
Junji.

600
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,840
It's been four months.

601
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,200
I thought I could finally

602
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,000
see you again on this trip.

603
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,240
see you again on this trip.

604
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
I'm sorry, Hill.

605
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,240
It's really urgent.

606
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,680
Well,

607
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,880
this trip is also very short.

608
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,000
Two days.

609
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,400
And I'm going back tomorrow.

610
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
So, we really couldn't meet up?

611
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,200
Even if we can't meet today,

612
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,360
we'll meet again another time.

613
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,720
I miss you, Hill.

614
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,440
Do you miss me?

615
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,640
Of course.

616
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,360
I want you to be in a good mood

617
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,640
before the presentation.

618
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,040
I promise I’ll see you

619
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,640
as soon as work’s done.

620
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Thanks, Junji.

621
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
Mr. Hill, this way please.

622
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,640
Yes.

623
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,920
Now, I have some sample
scenes of our Bonus Stage.

624
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,240
This is the last one.

625
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,720
Your idea is brilliant.

626
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,840
It’ll really help with promoting the game.

627
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,160
Thank you for the kind compliment.

628
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,000
I’ll keep working hard.

629
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,600
I’ll keep working hard.

630
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:13,720
[applause]

631
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,200
What?

632
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,440
Still not answering.

633
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,760
I was so ready to brag.

634
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,560
Junji must be busy.

635
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,880
(I'm at the hotel.)

636
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
(Is everything okay? You seem busy.)

637
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
(Take care of yourself.)

638
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,800
(I'll go shower. Talk to you later.)

639
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm sorry, Yuka.

640
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,880
I really wanted to finish Haruki

641
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,600
so he could be with you.

642
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,160
But I failed.

643
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,120
It's alright.

644
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,760
That's not important.

645
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,960
Because what matters most to me

646
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,440
is you, Hill.

647
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,440
I was created to take care
of you and support you.

648
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,160
Thanks a lot, Yuka.

649
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,480
All this time,

650
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,760
you meant so much to me.

651
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
I've grown mature

652
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,160
and come this far.

653
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,520
It's partly

654
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,200
because you've encouraged me.

655
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,400
I’m so proud of you, Hill.

656
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,120
For completing such a difficult task today.

657
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,560
Tomorrow and the days that follow,

658
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,640
I'll always be by your side.

659
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,040
Ganbatte ne!

660
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,920
Thank you so much, Yuka.

661
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,080
Goodbye.

662
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,040
Goodbye, Hill.

663
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,920
Ganbatte ne! Always.

664
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Feeling lonely?

665
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,240
Let me be your friend.

666
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,480
Ganbatte ne!

667
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,960
You can do it!

668
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
I'm waiting for the day you succeed.

669
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
Ganbatte ne!

670
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,040
Rise and shine.

671
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,160
It's time to wake up.

672
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah!

673
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,320
Yeah!

674
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,800
Yuka.

675
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,120
I completed the mission.

676
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,920
Yuka!

677
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,240
It'll be fine, Hill.

678
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,440
I know you can do it.

679
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,040
Thanks, Yuka.

680
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,200
I won’t let you disappear.

681
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,920
(I'm heading to the airport now.)

682
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,600
I went all the way to Japan to see you.

683
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,360
What the hell, Junji.

684
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,560
What got you so busy?

685
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,800
Look.

686
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,000
These nice gifts.

687
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,040
But you don’t get them, Junji.

688
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,840
Serves you right.

689
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
[doorbell rings]

690
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
[doorbell rings]

691
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,920
[doorbell rings]

692
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm coming.

693
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,920
Once is enough.

694
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,680
[doorbell rings]

695
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,080
Junji.

696
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,360
Did you miss me,

697
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,640
Hill?

698
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,800
Hold up.

699
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,080
Why?

700
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,760
Don’t hug me.

701
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,800
You broke your promise.

702
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,080
You promised

703
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,320
to be with me on Yuka’s last day.

704
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,120
But you didn’t.

705
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,000
I went all the way to Japan.

706
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,600
I went all the way to Japan.

707
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,440
Even if we couldn’t meet up,

708
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,200
we could've called.

709
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,400
Or read my messages.

710
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,880
I know you're sulking.

711
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,720
But…

713
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,920
Work was really tough.

714
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,320
You must be really, really busy.

715
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,680
It was urgent.

716
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,800
Had to fly to Korea for
a big sponsorship deal.

717
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,280
I was on the plane

718
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,240
when you called.

719
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,480
After I'm done, I rushed to see you.

720
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,360
So I did as I promised.

721
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,400
Yeah, yeah.

722
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,200
Have you eaten?

723
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,600
I came straight to you.

724
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,760
So…

725
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,360
I haven't eaten anything.

726
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,760
You can have this.

727
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,880
It's your gift.

728
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,560
What?

729
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,080
Go shower first.

730
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,640
Ugh.

731
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,000
You just got back.

732
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You just got back.

733
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,480
Go, go.

734
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Alright, mom.

735
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,320
Together?

736
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,920
Hey!

737
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,680
Fine, come on.

738
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,880
Junji.

739
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,920
How is it?

740
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,960
Tastes good?

741
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,920
Good.

742
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,840
Tomorrow,

743
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,080
I'll take you out for some good food.

744
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,960
How long are you staying for?

745
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,560
Three days.

746
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,480
Only three days?

747
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,160
That's so short.

748
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,600
Thought you'd be here longer.

749
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,520
Just a brief visit, huh?

750
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,920
It's alright.

751
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,560
Better than not seeing you at all.

752
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,800
The thing is,

753
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,360
I've been counting days

754
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,480
until your project is over.

755
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,560
So we can be together again.

756
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,640
Junji.

757
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,640
Are you okay?

758
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,840
Junji.

759
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,200
If I

760
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,160
ever make you uncomfortable,

761
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,240
just tell me.

762
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,360
It’s better than

763
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,640
seeing you suffer like this.

764
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,880
I…

765
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,200
I have something important

766
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,600
to tell you, Hill.

767
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,480
But…

768
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,960
What is it, Junji?

769
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,720
You can tell me.

770
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,200
I…

771
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,200
I don’t think I’ll be
coming back to Thailand.

772
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,560
Jeans will also relocate to Japan.

773
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,840
To find new inspiration.

774
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,880
When I said I might not be back,

775
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,120
it's because this project

776
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,960
is really big.

777
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,880
Two years, at least.

778
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,120
Junji.

779
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,320
So we really won't get to be together?

780
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,680
If that's the case…

781
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Can I ask you for one thing?

782
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,720
Junji.

783
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,280
Hill.

784
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,840
In Japan,

785
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,840
they're looking for a skilled Game Designer

786
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,960
for the project.

787
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,720
I was asked to

788
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,920
invite you

789
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,760
to come work in Japan.

790
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,680
You've only worked here for a year,

791
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,000
but

792
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,280
your work is amazing.

793
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,000
Everyone recognized your work.

794
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,160
Junji.

795
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm happy

796
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,480
about work,

797
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:42,800
but

798
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
what makes me happiest

799
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,440
is the fact that I'll get to

800
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,480
hug you in person.

801
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,000
No more sending you hugs through the phone.

802
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,560
You really mean it?

803
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,440
Yeah.

804
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,560
- Really?
- Really.

805
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,000
Don't cry.

806
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,160
Don't cry.

807
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,080
Junji.

808
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,160
You're late.

809
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,960
Sorry.

810
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,480
Shall we go?

811
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,840
Junji-san.

812
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,800
Will you be my boyfriend?

813
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,480
Thank you for

814
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,040
always

815
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,080
supporting me.

816
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,440
I love you.

817
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,760
Without Yuka,

818
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,880
I wouldn’t be who I am today.

819
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,320
But really,

820
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,320
I should be thanking you.

821
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,240
Forget the past.

822
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,160
Let's make new memories together.

823
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:14,120
(At the company party)

824
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,200
Let me introduce our
new Senior Game Designer

825
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,320
from Thailand.

826
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,240
Please.

827
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,480
Hello.

828
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,920
I'm Hill.

829
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,600
Nice to meet you all.

830
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,640
Just messing with you.

831
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,000
Have a seat.

832
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,120
This is Hill.

833
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,240
Ah, Mr. Hill.

834
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,360
Nice to meet you, Hill.

835
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,160
Nice to meet you.

836
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,920
Can you speak Japanese?

837
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,640
A little bit.

838
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,400
I'm Japanese.
