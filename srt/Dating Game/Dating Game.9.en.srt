1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,040
I want everyone to scout for

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,480
the spot for the game’s ending scene.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,960
I’m completely certain

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,200
about how I feel for you. It’s real.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,640
I can’t hold myself back anymore.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,920
The sponsored game scene
in your style, how's it going?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,720
…and speak heart-to-heart.
Just the two of us on the beach.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,040
Junji-san,

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,920
I love you.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,080
…high tide in Japanese?

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,120
High tide

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,280
High tide, low tide.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
I forgot Japanese.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,040
Let’s sit down.

15
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,920
Are you going to give me an answer?

16
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,880
What?

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,320
An answer?

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,360
Wait.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
Why are you calling me "Junji-san"?

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm sorry,

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,600
Boss.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Call me

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,520
"Junji."

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,800
Junji-sa—

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,080
Junji.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,240
Jun… ji.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,960
Feels weird.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Heh.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Junji.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,000
Junji-san.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Both are okay.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
Okay.

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,200
So, Junji or Junji-san,

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
what's your answer?

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,720
What?

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,960
Come on,

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,720
don’t play dumb.

39
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,120
Play dumb?

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,920
What's that?

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Dumb, dump, dummy?

42
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Play dummy?

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
If you keep playing dumb,

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,480
I might have to remind you.

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,760
Ready?

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,480
Junji-san,

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,120
I love you.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,640
Hill…

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,200
Are you telling me

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,960
or

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
Yuka?

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,440
So?

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,000
What's your answer,

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,040
Junji-san?

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah,

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,880
Me too.

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,280
As in…?

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,720
I

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,840
love you too.

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
Alright.

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,040
I’m the happiest man alive.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Banzai! (Yay!)

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,080
Hill, not so loud.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,720
It’s late.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,520
Okay, okay.

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,720
Banzai!

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Hill, I said quiet. It’s late.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
Banzai!

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,120
Art.

70
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,840
Say cheese.

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,800
Cheese.

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,200
Nice.

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,920
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

74
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,080
Junji.

75
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,120
Yeah?

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,400
Have a look.

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,000
Ta-da!

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,720
Ta-da!

79
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,400
Wow.

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,520
Told you, players would love
the female version of you.

81
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,880
You're quite bold choosing me
as the reference material.

82
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,080
Because I like the Junji who's kind to me.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Look at this.

84
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,920
See that?

85
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,920
The numbers are going up.

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,600
Art.

87
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah?

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Do you really mean it?

89
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,880
Hold on, Junji.

90
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,520
That’s not what I meant.

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I think you misunderstood me.

92
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,880
Oh.

93
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
Misunderstood?

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,880
But…

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
all this time—

96
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,200
I…

97
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,440
I just saw us as colleagues
who worked well together.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Nothing more.

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Art.

100
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,800
I’m so confused.

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,840
What’s even happening?

102
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,000
I can’t explain it.

103
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,720
I just…

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,880
…felt it.

105
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,920
I’m sorry.

106
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't swing that way.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,040
I don't swing that way.

108
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
No way…

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,400
If I’d just accepted my feelings back then,

110
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,960
maybe things…

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
Now, I know that my heart

112
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,000
is with you.

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,120
is with you.

114
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
So…

115
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,520
please forgive me.

116
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,320
This isn’t just presenting a project.

117
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
This is like a surprise proposal to Boss!

118
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,920
Yep.

119
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,560
Damn.

120
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,320
He went all out.

121
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Dude.

122
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,000
Where are you going?

123
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Hill!

124
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,840
Jeez.

125
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,520
What's up with him?

126
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,000
I’m not mad at you.

127
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,400
So there’s nothing to forgive.

128
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,800
So you’re giving me another chance?

129
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,280
It's all in the past.

130
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
My…

131
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,840
…feelings have changed.

132
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,000
I’m sorry.

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,280
I’m sorry.

134
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
Hang on.

135
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,800
If that's true, why did you
bring me back to this project?

136
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
It's work…

137
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
That's it.

138
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
Nothing more.

139
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Boss.

140
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
You’re cruel, Junji.

141
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,080
This thing between us
is not ending that easily.

142
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,120
You'll get fined, see?

143
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
You cleared the minibar out.

144
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,840
The company'll pay.

145
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
You're roommates?

146
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,760
No.

147
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,720
- We're not.
- I saw how much she ate.

148
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Did you eat everything? You'll get fined.

149
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,240
Boss looks happy.

150
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,040
Everyone here?

151
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,120
Yes, Boss.

152
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,840
Okay.

153
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Safe travels, everyone.

154
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,080
Hill and I will stay a couple more days.

155
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
Oh, Just the two of you?

156
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,720
Yeah.

157
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,840
There’s a place I want to survey.

158
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,680
Hill can help me gather data.

159
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,600
I can stay as well, Boss.

160
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,800
No need.

161
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,320
Art.

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,440
By the time I return,

163
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,480
it’ll be a while before we meet again.

164
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,520
So, thank you for helping us.

165
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,880
I guess I’m useless to you now.

166
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,800
Just kidding.

167
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,280
We’ll see each other again soon.

168
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
You know where to find me.

169
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,600
Hill.

170
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,640
Make yourself useful.

171
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,120
Junji-san, do you think Art is mad at us?

172
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,680
No.

173
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
He’s…

174
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,080
…always like that.

175
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,040
[sighs]

176
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,720
I like it here.

177
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,720
Hm?

178
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,280
Here?

179
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,880
Yeah.

180
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,200
Why? Thailand’s so hot.

181
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,760
Because…

182
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
I'm here with you, Hill.

183
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,800
From now on, just call me Junji.

184
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
Junji.

185
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,840
Like a Thai nickname.

186
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
No “Mr.”

187
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
No “-san.”

188
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,760
Because we’re…

189
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,120
a couple now.

190
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,640
Okay.

191
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Junji.

192
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,920
My boyfriend.

193
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,360
Finally, we’re here.

194
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,520
You really want me to
drop you off at the restaurant?

195
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
I can drop you off at home.

196
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,320
It’s fine.

197
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,040
I've been gone for days.

198
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,920
I have to do this.

199
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,880
Alright then.

200
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,520
I’ll stay with you.

201
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,320
No need. Just go home.

202
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,120
You’ve been driving all day.

203
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,520
Why?

204
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,640
I’m hungry.

205
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
Can I have a meal first?

206
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Okay, fine.

207
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,840
You better go home afterwards.

208
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,480
Don't wait.

209
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,640
I'll wait.

210
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,080
Because I don’t want the person I love

211
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,800
to go home all alone and tired.

212
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,320
Bay.

213
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,800
Hm?

214
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,320
As for our relationship,

215
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,120
it’s better not to jump the gun.

216
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Why not?

217
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,360
I’m not ready to answer
everyone’s questions.

218
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,960
Besides, we only started dating yesterday.

219
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,520
That's true.

220
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,520
But I like you so much.

221
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,920
I want people to know you're taken,

222
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,280
so no one will try to hit on you.

223
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
What's the matter?

224
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,600
If you’re good enough,

225
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
I’ve no reason to look at anyone else.

226
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,440
Right.

227
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,200
Do you understand me?

228
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
Of course.

229
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll do whatever I can

230
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,120
to make you feel at ease.

231
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,720
Now hurry up, eat, and go home.

232
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,200
And this is Yuka’s latest concept design.

233
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,120
Ta-da!

234
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,880
Wow.

235
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,600
That’s so cute. I love it.

236
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,760
But what is this outfit for?

237
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Yuka's just like

238
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,440
any other girl who loves looking pretty.

239
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,600
So if we give her a fresh new look,

240
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
it might change

241
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,000
someone's mind about releasing an update.

242
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,640
Nice.

243
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,280
I like that idea.

244
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,120
So, how was Chanthaburi?

245
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,080
Fun?

246
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,360
Must’ve been fun or

247
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,960
you two wouldn’t have stayed on together.

248
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,600
It was fun.

249
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,160
We found some really great locations.

250
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
Too bad you didn’t join us.

251
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,960
It’s better I didn’t.

252
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,160
Boss wouldn’t want me as the third wheel.

253
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,120
Bet you were happier without me in the way.

254
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,400
A-ha!

255
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,040
what’s with that look?

256
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,920
Spill it. What did you two get up to?

257
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,000
That outfit's yours?

258
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,000
It's Yuka’s new outfit.

259
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,320
It's Yuka’s new outfit.

260
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,640
Yuka, huh.

261
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,520
Hey, fans have never seen this look.

262
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,280
Is this like a rebrand for Yuka?

263
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
But…

264
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
will Boss approve?

265
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,720
Hm.

266
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,080
Looks good.

267
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,840
Really good.

268
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,480
Boss.

269
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,320
You feeling okay?

270
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,880
This is the first time

271
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
you’ve ever given an approval so quickly.

272
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,120
Not scheming something, are you?

273
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,880
What do you take me for?

274
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,400
Hmph.

275
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
Relax. Boss isn’t plotting anything.

276
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Relax. Boss isn’t plotting anything.

277
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,720
He’s just in a really good mood lately.

278
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,800
Want to pitch something? Now’s the time.

279
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
He'll say yes.

280
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,800
May I?

281
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
When are we planning

282
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,120
to release Yuka’s new look?

283
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,320
Once it's released,

284
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm sure fans will be surprised

285
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
and totally obsessed over it.

286
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,240
And getting surprise updates

287
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,200
right before a game shuts down?

288
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,120
They'll love it.

289
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,520
If we drop this out of nowhere,

290
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
it’ll definitely go viral.

291
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,080
Right…

292
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,920
Let’s make it a gift for the loyal players

293
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,400
who’ve always supported us.

294
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,680
You got it.

295
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
Hm…

296
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,520
But I think Yuka’s new look

297
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,880
should feel a bit more mature.

298
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,480
- No.
- No.

299
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,000
What? Is that such a bad idea?

300
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,840
What? Is that such a bad idea?

301
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,640
Don’t reject it right away.

302
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,800
We should at least discuss new ideas.

303
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,840
Since Yuka’s game won’t be
around for much longer.

304
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,360
And the new game for females is launching.

305
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,680
Why not let the guys have more options?

306
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Too late for that.

307
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,080
What’s going on here?

308
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,920
Got a problem?

309
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,200
The moment we dropped the new outfit,

310
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,520
we started trending on X.

311
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,280
No way it spread that fast!

312
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,240
That’s insane.

313
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,720
Yikes.

314
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,920
It's #banyukagame…

315
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,680
Whoa.

316
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,480
It’s trending in Japan too.

317
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,000
"Breaking news! The famous idol game

318
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,600
"Yuka! Love Me Please",

319
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,080
is exposed of its lie.

320
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,320
Yuka, a male in disguise,
has deceived fans for years."

321
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,920
Who the hell wrote this?

322
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,000
Damn it.

323
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,840
Damn it.

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,040
"Pretending to be a cute girl,

325
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,120
but actually a guy.

326
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,040
Makes me sick."

327
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
What's done is done…

328
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,480
Here’s the thing.

329
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,640
Yuka’s outer shell is based on Jeans.

330
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,960
But inside, she is 100% Junji.

331
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
You can’t tell anyone about this

332
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
because it’s top secret.

333
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
Crap.

334
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,640
We're getting roasted.

335
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
Boss, you need to do something.

336
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Seriously,

337
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,720
who started spreading this nonsense?

338
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,920
People are reporting our game like crazy.

339
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,080
Boss,

340
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
the number of users uninstalling

341
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
is skyrocketing.

342
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,200
All because of that one rumor?

343
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,640
That Yuka’s a guy?

344
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,280
Who cares about that anymore?

345
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,120
Hearing it pisses me off.

346
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,600
Isn't this about the heart?

347
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,000
I say we let gamers cool down a bit first

348
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,800
and explain later.

349
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Someone’s even threatening
to burn our office to the ground.

350
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,880
Isn’t that too much?

351
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,200
I don’t think they’ll actually do it.

352
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
Just some keyboard warriors.

353
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,120
Boss, Let's report this to the police.

354
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,120
I’ll investigate

355
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,520
and find out who it is.

356
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,440
This one got over 10,000 reposts.

357
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,800
"Yuka's real identity

358
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,080
is Boss Junji,

359
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,920
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand."

360
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,320
What the hell?

361
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,200
Boss is Yuka?

362
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,320
How could she be a cold guy like him?

363
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
…Enough.

364
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,280
What they’re saying is true.

365
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,640
I am

366
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
Yuka's reference material.

367
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,680
I’m her blueprint.

368
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,920
Boss? Yuka?

369
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,120
You are not alike.

370
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,320
And how come I never knew?

371
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,440
At her core,

372
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,000
she is modeled after him.

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
she is modeled after him.

374
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,120
He’s the feelings behind Yuka.

375
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,720
Just like how he was also
the reference for Mike.

376
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,000
That was Art’s idea.

377
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
Mine too.

378
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,880
Mine and Art's.

379
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,920
Right.

380
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,960
The idea was…

381
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,600
to make sure male players would

382
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,080
really like Yuka.

383
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,720
So they thought, who better than a man

384
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,520
to figure out what men want?

385
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,680
What's their ideal girl like?

386
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,800
So Art suggested Boss

387
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,680
role-play as Yuka.

388
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
I believe that Yuka became so successful

389
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,800
because we tried to shape her personality

390
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,120
and thoughts to be very realistic.

391
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,000
We conducted interviews, did researches,

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,280
We conducted interviews, did researches,

393
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,200
and gathered real women’s responses

394
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,080
to develop the character “Yuka.”

395
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,320
That’s why, to so many people,

396
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,920
Yuka isn’t just a game character.

397
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,720
She feels truly alive.

398
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,240
In other words, Boss became Yuka.

399
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
Which was already a part of who he is.

400
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,040
The problem was the game got promoted as

401
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,680
“Best Girlfriend: The Girl of Your Dreams.”

402
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,560
So Boss could never reveal the truth.

403
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,400
It would’ve clashed with the marketing.

404
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,200
So even the employees weren't

405
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,120
allowed to know?

406
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,160
Yeah.

407
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,640
Especially those with loose lips like you.

408
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Ms. Jeans,

409
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,640
you knew

410
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
because you designed the character.

411
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,520
because you designed the character.

412
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,240
But I'm the game designer and

413
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,040
I wasn’t allowed to know?

414
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,280
Crazy, huh?

415
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,320
Totally.

416
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,240
Crazy.

417
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,840
But the whole thing’s blowing up.

418
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,120
Which means,

419
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,520
someone on the inside leaked it.

420
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,720
But only a few knew: Boss,

421
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,240
Jeans,

422
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,200
and Art.

423
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,200
That’s it.

424
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,920
Art!

425
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
Back then,

426
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,920
we had no team, no budget.

427
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,480
Yuka was just a character

428
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,320
that Art and I created from scratch.

429
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,880
I never meant to deceive,

430
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,360
and neither did Art.

431
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,240
Hill!

432
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
Where is he going?

433
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,880
Hill…

434
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,720
I never meant to lie.

435
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,000
I already knew.

436
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,480
That Junji is Yuka.

437
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,120
To be honest,

438
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,600
I never thought it would get this far.

439
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,120
Back then, I didn’t even

440
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,560
think of it as a lie.

441
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,000
Yuka was just a character I created.

442
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,920
Yuka was just a character I created.

443
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Junji, do you know

444
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,760
why people love Yuka?

445
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,600
Because she’s cute and a talkative.

446
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,000
Everyone loves her

447
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,360
because

448
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,000
a would never lie to us.

449
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,480
a would never lie to us.

450
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
No matter what happens,

451
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,480
she’d always stay by our side

452
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,520
and cheer us on.

453
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,720
I’ve made everyone upset.

454
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,320
But I don’t understand,

455
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,320
just because I’m a guy?

456
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,680
Every dev team has both men

457
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,880
and women in it.

458
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,920
It’s probably not anger, really.

459
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,720
They’re just hurt.

460
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Because they told Yuka everything.

461
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,000
Yet she never told them
the most important truth.

462
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,760
Yet she never told them
the most important truth.

463
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,640
It's disappointing.

464
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,360
Hill…

465
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,880
do you feel the same way?

466
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,320
I like him.

467
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm happy when I’m with him.

468
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,920
But

469
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,680
because I like him,

470
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,280
I feel guilty towards Yuka.

471
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,880
No, not at all.

472
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,720
When I found out,

473
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,120
I was actually glad.

474
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
Oh.

475
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,120
Why?

476
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,600
Hm.

477
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,040
Well,

478
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,520
I felt like I was cheating as a gamer.

479
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,120
I got to know Yuka’s real self.

480
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
I’m sorry for being so difficult.

481
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,160
And making everyone’s job harder.

482
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,360
Your dream will definitely come true.

483
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,200
I’ll help.

484
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,640
[groans]

485
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Let's go, Boss.

486
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
Hey!

487
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,280
Who are you?

488
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,920
I’m his bodyguard, obviously.

489
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,680
Open it.

490
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,160
I’ll make sure the water bottle

491
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,720
gets put to good use.

492
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,120
Boss.

493
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Goodnight.

494
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,080
And

495
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,800
when I realized

496
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,520
you are her,

497
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,400
everything made sense.

498
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
You think so?

499
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,000
I think so.

500
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,200
It all made sense because…

501
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,520
Junji and Yuka are the same person.

502
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,720
That’s why I like you.

503
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
I…

504
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,520
really can’t keep up with you.

505
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
Hill,

506
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,800
you’re not mad at me, right?

507
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,280
No.

508
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,680
I’m not.

509
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Then why didn’t you come
ask me when you found out?

510
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,080
Then why didn’t you come
ask me when you found out?

511
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Well,

512
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,440
that's

513
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,800
because all the pieces fit together.

514
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,680
So I had no further doubts.

515
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,680
And besides,

516
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,040
I felt like it didn’t matter.

517
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,120
If you wanted to tell me,

518
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,720
one day you would.

519
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,240
At the right time.

520
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,920
I was afraid…

521
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,600
that you’d hate me, Hill.

522
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,280
Impossible.

523
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,640
Never.

524
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,680
You’re probably the only
one who doesn’t hate me.

525
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,000
Yuka’s fans around the world

526
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,040
Yuka’s fans around the world

527
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,960
won’t feel the same.

528
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,800
But thanks to you,

529
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,720
I understand the fans a little better.

530
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,600
When die-hard fans of Yuka,

531
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,280
the cute heroine from
"Yuka! Love Me Please,"

532
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,560
found out that the real identity of Yuka

533
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,120
was Junji Sakurai,

534
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,240
CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand,

535
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,200
the company behind the game.

536
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,920
They couldn’t accept it.

537
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,520
Demanded the company take responsibility

538
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,000
for deceiving players all this time.

539
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,480
for deceiving players all this time.

540
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,120
Damn it.

541
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,840
Store's rating dropped from 4.3 to 1.2.

542
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,320
Check the comments.

543
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
We’re getting grilled.

544
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,800
Screenshot.

545
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,920
Screenshot it all.

546
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,320
If it goes too far, we sue.

547
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,040
Calm down.

548
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
That’s not the best way to handle it.

549
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,400
Suing them won’t help.

550
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,720
The agency just called.

551
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,560
Sponsors want to pull out of the game.

552
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,560
And the brand Boss is endorsing

553
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,440
want to renegotiate the contract.

554
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,120
They even said it might be terminated.

555
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,320
Damn you, Art.

556
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
You told me not to sue people.

557
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,400
Should I just tell Boss to sue only Art?

558
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:46,920
Mm.

559
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,280
That could work.

560
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,520
But we need proof

561
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,240
that Art leaked the info.

562
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,880
But who else could it be?

563
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,720
What do you think, Hill?

564
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,640
I guess,

565
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
maybe we should try talking to Art first.

566
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,360
maybe we should try talking to Art first.

567
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,320
Unbelievable. I'm going insane.

568
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,120
Guys, bad news.

569
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,480
Our parent company wants
to hold a press conference.

570
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,680
They want us to say that I'm the real Yuka.

571
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you know how much
the company has invested?

572
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,880
Then,

573
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,400
have Junji-san hold a press conference

574
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
and officially announce that
Jeans-chan is Yuka’s real identity.

575
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
Now we’re screwed.

576
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,080
What?

577
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,600
Really?

578
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,240
Seriously?

579
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,720
We’re IT guys too, you know?

580
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,520
Tracing the first post

581
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,120
and its origin

582
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,880
isn’t that hard.

583
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,600
That was quick.

584
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,840
So you revealed this

585
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
to make Junji notice you?

586
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,120
I’m not a kid.

587
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,120
Why would I do that?

588
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,560
You're right.

589
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,680
Then why did you do it?

590
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,800
I just wanted the world to know.

591
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,200
That’s all.

592
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,320
How’s that working out?

593
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,480
Does ruining someone

594
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,120
make you feel better?

595
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,440
It’s alright.

596
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,440
Doesn’t feel good, doesn’t feel bad.

597
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,840
If you're feeling upset,

598
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,040
take it out on me.

599
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,520
Why drag Junji into this?

600
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,040
You really don’t get it, do you?

601
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,720
Think you’re that important?

602
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,040
No.

603
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,400
I’m not important at all.

604
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,200
But you’re the one who created this game.

605
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,120
And you chose this job

606
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,000
because you wanted players to be happy.

607
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,760
because you wanted players to be happy.

608
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,400
That’s what really matters.

609
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,280
Fine.

610
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,640
Why don’t you ask him directly

611
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,800
why he lied?

612
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,120
I already talked to him.

613
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,920
He’s devastated.

614
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
He wants to make things right.

615
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,520
So he sent you here to talk to me?

616
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,640
Heh.

617
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,640
Are you nuts?

618
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,120
No. I came here on my own.

619
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,040
Really?

620
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,080
For what?

621
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Just to lecture me?

622
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,720
Leave. You’re wasting my time.

623
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,600
I came here to ask for your help.

624
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,120
Not for Junji.

625
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,720
For Yuka’s fans.

626
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,200
I’m begging you.

627
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Help protect their feelings.

628
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,880
People who have nothing to do with this

629
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
shouldn’t have to get hurt, right?

630
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,000
Are you…

631
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,880
asking me to help you lie?

632
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,320
Not interested.

633
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,040
No. I’m not asking you to lie.

634
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,440
And I’m not asking you to do it for free.

635
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,520
I'm asking you to

636
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,440
show up at the press conference

637
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,800
and back us up, as the programmer,

638
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,720
that Jeans is Yuka's reference.

639
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,840
Because it’s true, isn’t it?

640
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,000
The three of you made this game together.

641
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,520
The three of you made this game together.

642
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,880
You all shaped Yuka just as much.

643
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,720
Go back to the part where

644
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,520
you said I’m not doing it for free.

645
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,280
Well,

646
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,120
if you agree to help us this time,

647
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,480
I’ll talk to Junji.

648
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Tell him not to blame you for this.

649
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,320
Using the fact that you're his boyfriend

650
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,600
to help with my case, huh?

651
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,760
Do you think Junji mixes personal life

652
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,920
with work?

653
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,320
Great.

654
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,200
You don’t know him at all.

655
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,640
But I do know that he is
more reasonable than that.

656
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,120
Alright, then.

657
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,920
If you want me to consider it,

658
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,120
you’ll have to do better.

659
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,200
You have to leave Junji

660
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,080
and resign from this company.

661
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,480
Can you do that?

662
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,720
Food will be served shortly.

663
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,720
Table for one?

664
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,520
For two. A friend’s on the way.

665
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,880
Of course, have a seat.

666
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,720
Here’s the menu.

667
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,520
Upload all those documents, alright?

668
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,080
Go ahead.

669
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,840
Yeah.

670
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,120
Exactly.

671
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,200
That's right.

672
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,280
Just do it.

673
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,240
Here’s your menu.

674
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,520
Thanks.

675
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,920
Get it ready.

676
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,680
I’ll be right back.

677
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,600
Boss likes it that way.

678
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,800
Doesn't matter if we use it or not.

679
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,320
Yeah, print it all out too.

680
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,000
If anyone asks for proof,
we can hit back with it.

681
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,280
If anyone asks for proof,
we can hit back with it.

682
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,840
Got it?

683
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,320
Good.

684
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,720
Sounds like a mess.

685
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,920
Got everyone crazy.

686
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,440
Yeah. Big mess across the whole company.

687
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,920
Your friend, my boss.

688
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,120
Take a seat?

689
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
Later, a staff will

690
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,720
come take your order.

691
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,360
Phat. Why are you in the kitchen?

692
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,320
Why not sit with your friend?

693
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
They ask for you.

694
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,600
In a minute.

695
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,280
They joined tables, you know?

696
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,840
Which table?

697
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,320
The new pretty lady,

698
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,440
the handsome guy, and your friend.

699
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,920
They know each other?

700
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,760
I snooped a bit.

701
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,600
Those two look like reporters.

702
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,920
I’ll check it out.

703
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,320
Mr. Bay,

704
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,920
could I get your LINE ID?

705
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,880
I’d like to follow up on a some details.

706
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,480
Of course, with pleasure.

707
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,520
I'll do the scan.

708
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,520
Okay.

709
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,800
Here you go.

710
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,600
Alright.

711
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,240
You got it?

712
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,520
Feel free to call me if you need anything.

713
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,720
Sure.

714
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,800
All done with work talk?

715
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,000
Why not stay for dessert?

716
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,920
That's fine. We’re stuffed.

717
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,000
Thank you so much.

718
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,920
Alright. Thank you.

719
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,520
See you.

720
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,280
I’ll text you later.

721
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,720
Okay.

722
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,880
Thanks again.

723
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,360
You’re in the back

724
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,600
instead of eating with me.

725
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,600
Can't help it.

726
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,080
I’m the chef.

727
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,920
And I'm working.

728
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,840
Hill.

729
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,240
How did you get here?

730
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,640
I'm a genius.

731
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:55,920
What?

732
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,560
Hill.

733
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,480
Shoes off.

734
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,920
I brought a bunch of food for you.

735
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,720
You haven’t eaten since morning, right?

736
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,560
Yeah, I really haven’t.

737
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,000
Sorry for coming so late.

738
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,480
Thought I'd be a bother,

739
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,520
but I figured you’d still be working.

740
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,880
And I also thought…

741
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,200
that you shouldn’t be alone tonight.

742
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,440
Thanks.

743
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,320
And I’ve got good news for you, too.

744
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,680
What is it?

745
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,880
I talked to Art today.

746
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,160
He agreed to show up

747
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,440
at the press conference.

748
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,320
He’ll help confirm that

749
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,640
Jeans was the reference for Yuka.

750
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,520
But if Art were the one behind this,

751
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,680
he wouldn’t agree to help.

752
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,680
I already checked.

753
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,680
It wasn’t him.

754
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,160
It was the anti-fans

755
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,200
making things up.

756
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,320
Here, Junji.

757
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,000
Have you tried kaya bread from this place?

758
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,960
Have you tried kaya bread from this place?

759
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,880
I got it at the night market.

760
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,720
Eat it while it’s hot.

761
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,000
Try it,

762
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,800
it's extremely delicious.

763
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,080
Hill.

764
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,600
Are you alright?

765
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,120
I'm fine.

766
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:23,880
You sure?

767
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,760
Just worried about you.

768
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,240
I hate seeing you stuck
in a situation like this.

769
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,320
Thanks for worrying.

770
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,440
But I’m the one who started it.

771
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,000
I put myself in this situation.

772
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,480
So, I have to fix it.

773
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,080
You are

774
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,440
the most capable person I’ve ever met.

775
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,920
But even the strongest need to rest.

776
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,920
I may not be able to do much,

777
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,000
but you can hand me some of the weight.

778
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,240
I’ll help carry it for you.

779
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,000
Wait.

780
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,080
Talk to me first.

781
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,200
Not now.

782
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,120
What are you afraid of?

783
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,400
Or do you just not trust me?

784
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,880
I’m not sure anymore.

785
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,000
We’ve come this far.

786
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,720
Tell me why you can’t trust me.

787
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,240
We can do this.

788
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,720
We don’t have a single thing in common.

789
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,640
You’re right.

790
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,920
We don’t have anything in common.

791
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,000
But you complete me.

792
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,480
Make me want to fit in with you.

793
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,400
And you know what?

794
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,920
You made me realize you're the one.

795
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,520
No more running from the truth.

796
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,000
My dad used to say that, too.

797
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,320
What?

798
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,120
He promised he’d come back.

799
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,600
But he never did.

800
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,520
He chose the other woman.

801
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,680
I pitied my mom so much back then.

802
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,400
She used to say, “A cheater's the worst.”

803
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,320
Even now,

804
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,720
I still can’t bring myself to tell her

805
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,240
that I’m dating you.

806
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,920
I’m scared that one day
you'll stop feeling the thrill,

807
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,240
you'll get bored,

808
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,720
and you’ll be just like my dad.

809
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,440
You’re my boyfriend now.

810
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,240
I swear to the heavens,

811
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,440
if I ever turn into that kind of man,

812
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,000
may I be alone forev—

813
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,120
Don’t swear it.

814
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,680
Or I’ll end up alone too.

815
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,280
Let's go home.

816
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,640
Better now?

817
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,320
[knocking]

818
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,240
Softer.

819
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,000
[knocking]

820
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,000
What's up?

821
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,120
Hello, Mom.

822
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:44,920
Hi, Pim.

823
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,560
You again?

824
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,400
Perfect timing. I need a hand.

825
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,920
Come help me grab
something from the top shelf.

826
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,280
Of course, my pleasure.

827
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,120
But first, I’ve got something

828
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,520
to tell the both of you.

829
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,720
I’m…

830
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,800
dating Phat.

831
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,240
Bay, don’t say it.

832
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,240
It’s true.

833
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,880
All right. I got it.

834
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,000
Mom.

835
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,080
I kind of figured it out
from the very first day.

836
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,440
Come on.

837
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,000
What do you mean?

838
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,240
It’s not what you think.

839
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,000
Hey.

840
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,720
Phat.

841
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,680
You're all grown up now.
A boyfriend isn't a bad thing.

842
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,080
I’ve got no problem with it.

843
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,720
What?

844
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,280
Wait a second.

845
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,200
What’s with the plot twist?

846
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,280
You told me and him not to date!

847
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,600
[clears throat]

848
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,840
All men are jerks.

849
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,520
- I said that?
- Sure did.

850
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,400
I must've been drunk.

851
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,240
- Mom!
- Mom!

852
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,280
I mean, I was hurt.

853
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,800
Your dad was a real womanizer.

854
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,760
Oh, Mom.

855
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,240
You made me and Phat scared of dating.

856
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,520
That’s why we’re still single.

857
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,520
And he's got it worse than me.

858
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,640
He’s practically afraid of love.

859
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,520
Oh, dear.

860
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,720
That’s not my intention.

861
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,240
[sighs]

862
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,280
I'm getting a headache.

863
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,280
Forgive me, will you?

864
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,640
Let’s just say, the old me is gone now.

865
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,520
Actually,

866
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,080
I've got something
I want to tell you kids too.

867
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,800
What now, Mom?

868
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,920
I’ve been seeing someone.

869
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,880
Huh?

870
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,680
Why didn’t you tell us?

871
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,720
Well, I was shy.

872
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,000
I was afraid you’d think I'm too old

873
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,160
I was afraid you’d think I'm too old

874
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,720
to be dating.

875
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,640
Is this even my real mom?

876
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,040
Good love changes people for the better.

877
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,920
And I want you two

878
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,680
to find good love as well.

879
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,680
Wow…

880
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,960
since Mom’s saying it like that,

881
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,320
may I say something too?

882
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,320
Go on, I'm listening.

883
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,320
Phat…

884
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,720
I promise you, in front of
your mom and your sister,

885
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,920
I’ll stay faithful and
keep no secrets from you.

886
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,440
Marry him already!

887
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,720
Mom!

888
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,160
[sighs]

889
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,200
Bay, did you put a spell on my mom?

890
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,280
My charm's enough.

891
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,080
Stop teasing him.

892
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,840
Hill.

893
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,520
You can go to sleep.

894
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,320
I…

895
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,200
don't want to.

896
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,520
I’ll wait until your work's done.

897
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,240
It'll take a while.

898
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,480
Still have to finish the speech.

899
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:34,120
I can’t think of the right words to say.

900
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,160
You know,

901
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,720
Yuka’s sincerity once saved me.

902
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,000
And Junji, you’re the same.

903
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,240
And Junji, you’re the same.

904
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,280
Yuka or Junji.

905
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,880
I believe if you just show your sincerity,

906
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,760
everyone will understand you.

907
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,440
Okay.

908
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:26,720
That’s it.

909
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,600
Time to rest now, Junji.

910
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,800
[sighs]

911
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,720
Hill, what do you think

912
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,480
Yuka would say tomorrow?

913
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,520
Tomorrow?

914
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,120
Hm.

915
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,520
If it were Yuka,

916
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,080
she’d probably say

917
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,320
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

918
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,440
I think.

919
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,520
At the press conference?

920
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,520
My Yuka-chan.

921
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,280
No matter what life throws at her,

922
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,120
she manages to find the good.

923
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,680
She’s someone who lifts people up.

924
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,120
Taught me how to be more positive.

925
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,360
Yuka-chan is very honest

926
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,480
but not rude.

927
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,720
You get what I mean?

928
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,600
She never lies.

929
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,400
Because…

930
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,880
Yuka was created to be the light

931
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,720
in the life of a lonely soul like me.

932
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,520
Junji.

933
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,440
I’m so proud of you.

934
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,800
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

935
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,520
Thanks.

936
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,040
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

937
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,000
Ganbatte ne. (You got this)

938
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,600
Yeah.

939
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,840
Ganbaru. (I got this)

940
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,080
You said it wouldn’t be crowded.

941
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,080
This isn't crowded.

942
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,720
This is just the authorized press.

943
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,520
Boss is really famous.

944
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,880
Mr. Junji’s here!

945
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,320
Uh…

946
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,640
To avoid any mistakes,

947
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,520
I’ll speak in Japanese,

948
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,320
and Ms. Jeans will translate.

949
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,040
I’m Junji Sakurai,

950
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:56,240
Executive and Director Game Designer
at PRISMSTAR Thailand.

951
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,000
This is Mr. Art, our lead programmer,

952
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,040
This is Mr. Art, our lead programmer,

953
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:05,240
and Mr. Bay, Mr. Art's predecessor.

954
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,600
I’m Junji Sakurai,

955
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,520
Executive and Director Game Designer
at PRISMSTAR Thailand.

956
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,800
This is Mr. Art, our lead programmer,

957
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,200
and Mr. Bay, standing in the back

958
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,760
was Mr. Art's predecessor.

959
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,080
We created "Yuka! Love Me Please" together.

960
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,440
We created "Yuka! Love Me Please" together.

961
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,240
Both Ms. Jeans and Mr. Art

962
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,720
can confirm that

963
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,080
everything I’m about to say

964
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,520
is truthful in every sense.

965
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,120
About the news that broke yesterday,

966
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,720
I am indeed the person behind Yuka.

967
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,400
And yes, I deceived the players.

968
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,000
Allow me to clarify.

969
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,200
I withheld a crucial truth that

970
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,560
affected people’s decision
to buy and play the game.

971
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,000
Some players grew so attached to Yuka

972
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,800
Some players grew so attached to Yuka

973
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,600
that they treated her
like a real girlfriend.

974
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,960
When they found out through social media

975
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,800
that Yuka's modeled after a man,

976
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,160
they felt disappointed.

977
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,200
I sincerely apologize.

978
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,000
I am solely responsible.

979
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:44,840
Now I understand why players feel so hurt.

980
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,320
It’s because they believed Yuka embodied

981
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,480
sincerity, cheerfulness

982
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,840
courage and positivity.

983
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:58,720
I never imagined that so
many people would trust me,

984
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,000
even though I was just
an invisible presence inside.

985
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,320
even though I was just
an invisible presence inside.

986
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,280
And I, Junji Sakurai,

987
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:13,680
apologize to everyone
for betraying that trust.

988
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,680
But I can’t twist the facts.

989
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,280
Yuka was modeled after me.

990
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,040
That is the truth.

991
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,400
It is true that Yuka was modeled after me.

992
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,320
Is that true?

993
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,320
So it's really true?

994
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,120
Do you have no excuse at all?

995
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,800
Will you fix this?

996
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,200
Did you really do that?

997
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,080
It’s true, isn’t it?

998
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,800
Yes. I am Yuka.

999
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,800
That's the truth

1000
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:08,920
Oh dear.

1001
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,520
Man.

1002
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,880
Do you really have to go, Junji?

1003
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,440
Bay.

1004
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,200
Pim.

1005
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,960
What is going on?

1006
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,760
I should never have trusted you.

1007
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,280
You’d better leave.

1008
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,120
Dad, Mom!

1009
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,960
my boss, Junji.

1010
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,000
You got a letter.

1011
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,120
Looks like an invitation to the reunion.

1012
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,360
Mr. Junji, right?

1013
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,160
Praewa.
