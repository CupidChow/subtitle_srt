1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,120
Thanks for showing me
around all these nice places.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,000
Would it be cool if I asked
you to be my boyfriend?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Since we’ve cleared Mission Two,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,040
we’re moving on to the final mission.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,800
Ask him to be your boyfriend.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,520
If you want to win his heart,

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,600
you'll need insights.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,640
Insights?

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,840
Tanabata?

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,400
Junji-san,

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,120
will you be my boyfriend?

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,280
Junji-san,

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,000
will you be my boyfriend?

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,560
Hello? Hill!

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,360
Man, you did it!

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,000
His heart is racing!

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
Whoa, whoa!

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
Guys, come here!

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
- Look!
- Come quick!

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,920
His pulse is going up!

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,720
My god!

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,400
Oh, man.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,480
What’s going on?

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,760
It really is.

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,280
Yeah.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,960
See that?

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,040
Oh.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,560
Wow.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait, what?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Wait, what?

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
What the heck?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Hey, look!

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,280
Damn.

34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,360
Yes!

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
[cheering]

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
That's it!

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,920
[cheering]

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,200
Amazing work!

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,800
His pulse is going up!

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,840
I thought we’d fail for sure.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,800
We’ve got to celebrate!

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Actually, I'm good.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
Later, everyone.

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,760
Hey, Hill! Hill!

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,600
Hill?

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh no.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
He really hung up.

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,760
His fangirls still has something to say.

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,280
Yeah.

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,760
Oh well.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
I guess he's not free to join us.

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,320
Let’s just party on our own!

53
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,520
Today's bill

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
is on me!

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,640
[cheering]

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,600
Wow.

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Big Boss Pao!

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,920
As expected of our Level Design team lead!

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
Alright, everyone!

60
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,800
Free food doesn’t come often!

61
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Let's go!

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Come on, guys!

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Hill's so amazing.

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,000
What should I eat?

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,000
Let’s go!

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,280
Let’s go!

67
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,800
Maybe pork skewer?

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Hang on—

69
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,640
What?

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
What is it, Big Boss Pao?

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,080
Do you think I could borrow 3,000 baht?

72
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,640
You!

73
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,560
Oh dear.

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Big Boss Pao.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,680
Trying to look generous
when you're actually broke?

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,520
You've got it wrong.

77
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,000
I’m just taking the team out for a meal!

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,680
Just 3,000. I’ll return it when I get paid.

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,840
Funny how you always say you're broke,

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,800
but live like royalty on instagram.

81
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm not lending you any.

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,200
You sure don’t hold back, Ms. Witty.

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,680
Hey.

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean,

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,640
I will pay you back.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Ms. Secretary, it’s just 3,000.

87
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
You said this before.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,160
Please, please!

89
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,600
300% interest!

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
So stingy!

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
Or go beg someone else!

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
Can you give me 3,000?

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
- No way.
- Ms. Secretary.

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,720
- Please!
- Ask someone else.

95
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,400
Have mercy!

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,920
So,

97
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,080
Pao said

98
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,440
I’ve completed the final mission.

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
Good.

100
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,080
Congratulations.

101
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,640
Since you're feeling better,

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
I should be on my way.

103
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,040
Wait…

104
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,760
Thank you, Junji-san.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Same goes to you, Hill,

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,760
for all the effort you put in.

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
Take care of yourself.

108
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,760
I must thank you, Hill.
For completing every mission.

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,280
I’d love to hear his thoughts,

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,440
since he’s played a big role

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,000
in developing this game.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,840
Well, I’m truly happy

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,720
to be part of the team
behind the male dating sim.

114
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,760
And I want to thank everyone

115
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,840
for supporting me all along.

116
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,040
There’s also one more person

117
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,120
I’d like to thank.

118
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,400
This person always supported
me through every mission.

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,400
Thank you so much,

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
Junji-san.

121
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,000
[applause]

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
Thank you, Hill.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,480
Actually…

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,120
Hill.

125
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Now that we're done with missions,

126
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,200
you should probably go back to

127
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,600
calling me “Boss.”

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,200
Oh.

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,680
Got it,

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,200
Boss.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,600
So,

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,400
thanks to Hill’s research,
we’ve now reached a point

133
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
where the Level Design team
is working with the programmers.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,880
We’ll start developing a prototype

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,560
and enter the “Prototyping” phase.

136
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,360
From now on, let’s work together

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,080
to complete this project.

138
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,200
Yes.

139
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,680
Thank you, Boss.

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
And thank you, everyone.

141
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Now, let’s all get back to work.

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,760
Let’s go.

143
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Come on, dude.

144
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,960
Yes, Junji-san?

145
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,680
Oops.

146
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,480
I mean, Boss.

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
Oh, Hill?

148
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,800
Sorry, wrong number.

149
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
I was calling the secretary.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
I see.

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,640
Well,

152
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,000
it’s nothing.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,680
That’s all.

154
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,600
Yes,

155
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
Boss.

156
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
[sighs]

157
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,920
Hello?

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,800
Yes, Boss.

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,440
Damn.

160
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
[sighs]

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Junji-san,

162
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,600
will you be my boyfriend?

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
Boss?

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Boss?

165
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,400
Boss!

166
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,960
What the—?!

167
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,160
Oh, yes?

168
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,520
I…

169
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
I just ran into Hill. He wanted me to ask

170
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,120
if you needed anything since you called.

171
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
Said you called him but didn't say a word.

172
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,680
Oh…

173
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,360
It's nothing. Wrong number.

174
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,200
I see.

175
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
[sighs]

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,720
Ugh.

177
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,720
Wow!

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
It's a home run, Boss!

179
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Amazing.

180
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
That's amazing.

181
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,720
Wow!

182
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,200
A home run, Boss!

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,280
You did it!

184
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,240
That's a home run?

185
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,120
Yay!

186
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Woohoo!

187
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,800
You're amazing, Boss.

188
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,360
So cool!

189
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Hey, bro?

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,600
You still playing?

191
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Oh.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Nah, I’m done.

193
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,280
Is that you, Hill?

194
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,760
Why are you here?

195
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,960
Don’t you have class?

196
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,200
Well…

197
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
He brings me here to play games.

198
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
So, I don't need you now.

199
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,120
Aren't you seeing someone? You disappeared.

200
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,200
Are we going to play or not?

201
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,520
How do you hold it?

202
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,920
Here, like this.

203
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
Don’t hold it too far back.

204
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
Your hands should go here.

205
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
And then—

206
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,000
Excuse me, Boss.

207
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,080
Seeing someone?

208
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,000
Maybe I do feel that way about him?

209
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,600
No. This is just work.

210
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,080
No.

211
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,080
Nope.

212
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,560
Hey, Yuka.

213
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,680
It’s been a while.

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,520
Hello, Hill.

215
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
It’s been exactly…

216
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,880
4 days, 14 hours, 45 minutes

217
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,240
And 41 seconds.

218
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,760
That’s right.

219
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,760
This is the longest
we’ve gone without talking.

220
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,920
You must’ve been super busy.

221
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,680
I'm cheering you on.

222
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,840
Ganbatte ne! (You got this!)

223
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,760
Yuka.

224
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,920
Would it be wrong

225
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,800
if someone who already has a partner

226
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,000
ends up falling for someone else?

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
ends up falling for someone else?

228
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,960
Falling for something?

229
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,000
Your voice was too quiet, I didn't hear it.

230
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,600
It’s nothing, Yuka.

231
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,400
If there’s anything you’re curious about,

232
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
feel free to ask me anytime.

233
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,400
Hill! Long time no see, man.

234
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,600
Congrats! You completed Mission Mike!

235
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
Let's celebrate together.

236
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Thanks, man.

237
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,240
If nothing comes up, I'll be there.

238
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
What would happen?

239
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,680
The mission’s done.

240
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,920
You don’t need to chase after Boss anymore.

241
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,480
So you should be free.

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,080
Let’s go celebrate.

243
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Sure thing.

244
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,680
What about you?

245
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,880
How are things with Phat?

246
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,640
No problems with Phat at all.

247
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,400
I’ve got a plan.

248
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Let’s grab some coffee
before the long meeting.

249
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,080
Your treat.

250
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,520
Sure, it's just a coffee.

251
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,880
Right now we're missing a 3D Programmer.

252
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,640
to fix bugs and program background scenes.

253
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,680
Our team has done our
best to fix these issues.

254
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,000
But we just couldn’t solve them.

255
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,760
So we need to find someone who can.

256
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,000
Can anyone recommend someone good?

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Can anyone recommend someone good?

258
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,800
Pao, are you suggesting someone?

259
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,400
I…

260
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
I think this job is really tough,

261
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,200
since it’s a 3D project
that emphasizes realism.

262
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,440
This is serious

263
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,920
and there'll be problems.

264
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,760
We'll need someone with proper expertise.

265
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,280
Someone with a strong reputation.

266
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
If I had to recommend someone,

267
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,600
I'd suggest…

268
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
Who? Just say it.

269
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Art.

270
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
The one who worked on
"Yuka! Love Me Please" with Bay.

271
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,600
Yeah, I know.

272
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,760
Oh.

273
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
Bay! Hey!

274
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,640
I’m so confused right now.

275
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
What’s going on?

276
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,200
Is Art going to work with us or not?

277
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
Isn't he a legendary programmer?

278
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,720
He helped develop "Yuka! Love Me Please."

279
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,840
You've worked with him.
Is he really that good?

280
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,440
He’s good.

281
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,200
But.

282
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,720
What is it?

283
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,800
Art and Boss used to
have something going on.

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,560
No way.

285
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Seriously?

286
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,800
Didn’t you see his face

287
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,120
when Pao mentioned Art?

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,120
Boss looked conflicted.

289
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,600
I guess Boss feels uneasy
about Art coming back too.

290
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,240
I bet.

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,800
I think Art’s return might

292
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,280
cause more problems than good.

293
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,400
Thanks for the birthday surprise!

294
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,240
You really are a fan.

295
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,680
I am.

296
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
Bay.

297
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,920
Why are you here?

298
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
You can't be here.

299
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,640
Phat!

300
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,440
Don't be mean to your friend.

301
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,640
You're terrible.

302
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Check this out.

303
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,880
My gift from Bay.

304
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,000
Isn’t it cute?

305
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,080
Limited edition.

306
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,480
And he also bought seedless grapes for mom.

307
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,600
He's nice and totally gets me.

308
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,120
Bay, sweetie.

309
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes, Mom?

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
Come help me prep the food.

311
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,880
Absolutely, with pleasure.

312
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Sweetie?

313
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,040
Oh, the birthday boy is back!

314
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,000
Take a look at this, Phat.
Chef Bay made all this.

315
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
He helped me with everything.

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
With skills like that,

317
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,440
why not partner up with him

318
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,640
at our Silver-Gold Table restaurant?

319
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,160
But I wonder if Bay even wants to join us.

320
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,480
Of course I do!

321
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,040
But I’m not sure if Phat wants me in on it.

322
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,200
Oh, please.

323
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,680
Don’t ask Phat, Bay.

324
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
Ask her.

325
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,600
If she’s okay with it,

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,880
consider it done.

327
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,800
For you, sweetie—

328
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,320
Yes?

329
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,200
I’ll give you most of the share!

330
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,280
Seriously?

331
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,080
[laughs]

332
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,200
Is that okay, Phat?

333
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,440
Sure.

334
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
Let’s have lunch together tomorrow.

335
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
Let him check out the restaurant.

336
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
He's a shareholder.

337
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,080
Exactly!

338
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,000
I’ll go all out tomorrow!

339
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,400
[laughs]

340
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,440
Bay gave this to me.

341
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,960
Look. This one's super rare.

342
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,840
Cheers to the birthday boy!

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Cheers!

344
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,800
Wow.

345
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,920
Hey.

346
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,800
You got guts pulling this off.

347
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,840
Next time, give me a heads-up.

348
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,840
Then,

349
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,000
it would no longer be a surprise.

350
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,280
Oh, I was so surprised
I almost had a heart attack.

351
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,400
You even lied to Mom
about us being college friends.

352
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,280
And show off with the restaurant’s recipes.

353
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,880
No wonder they're both pleased with you.

354
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,600
So? My birthday present?

355
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,720
Didn’t think that far. Mind if I owe you?

356
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
You’re weird.

357
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,000
You got gifts for Mom and Pim,

358
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,600
but none for the birthday boy.

359
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,160
Well, then…

360
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,280
How about me as your birthday present?

361
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,600
[snorts]

362
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,400
Very funny.

363
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,360
Happy Birthday to you.

364
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,200
Happy Birthday to you.

365
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,040
Happy Birthday.

366
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:50,000
Happy Birthday to you.

367
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,280
Thanks.

368
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,200
- I got it.
- Careful.

369
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,920
Put it right here.

370
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
Wishing you good luck and success!

371
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
Your birthday gift from me.

372
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,200
Surprise!

373
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,800
Here.

374
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,000
Look.

375
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,440
Chef’s coat.

376
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,600
It’s got your name on it. Chef Phat.

377
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,480
See?

378
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,360
And a hat.

379
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,800
Here.

380
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,800
Thanks.

381
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,480
Sure.

382
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Well? Do you like it?

383
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,640
Whoa!

384
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,840
Oh, it's about to rain.

385
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,560
You’d better go before

386
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,960
the road become dangerous.

387
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,240
I didn’t drive here today.

388
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,480
I’ll get a taxi for you then.

389
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,200
It is raining.

390
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,960
You'll catch a cold getting in a taxi all soaked.

391
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,720
Why don’t you stay here for the night?

392
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,680
Wait,

393
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,360
Mom…

394
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,240
Let him sleep in your room, Phat.

395
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,000
Are you sure?

396
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,800
Yeah.

397
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,520
[sighs]

398
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,920
Staying the night was your plan, wasn’t it?

399
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You little devil.

400
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Always so sneaky.

401
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,200
What are you talking about?

402
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,520
I just wanted to be close to you.

403
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,120
But if you’re unhappy,

404
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,000
I’ll sleep on the floor.

405
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,840
Be my guest.

406
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,960
Phat.

407
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,200
Go ahead.

408
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,400
There.

409
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,920
Nice and comfy.

410
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,280
Whoa!

411
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Hey!

412
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,000
You.

413
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What are you doing?

414
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,240
Don’t tell me you’re scared of thunder.

415
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,320
Seriously?

416
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,600
Or is it…

417
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,360
Is this…

418
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
another one of your tricks?

419
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,200
another one of your tricks?

420
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,680
Hey!

421
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,200
You idiot.

422
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,200
Let go.

423
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Hey, you.

424
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,640
Hey.

425
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,080
[sighs]

426
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,080
There, there.

427
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,520
It's okay.

428
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,160
There, there.

429
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
Here, loosen up.

430
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,240
Well…

431
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,920
I'm not that stressed out.

432
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
That’s what you call not stressed?

433
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,200
You and him ended things ages ago.

434
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,280
So why are you still like this?

435
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,240
You still have feelings for him?

436
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,520
Don’t be ridiculous.

437
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,760
I was just kidding.

438
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,160
Relax.

439
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
If you’re not okay working with Art,

440
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,200
If you’re not okay working with Art,

441
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
then don't.

442
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
And then? Look for someone else?

443
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,080
Plenty of programmers out there.

444
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,320
He's not special.

445
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,200
I've got great connections in the industry.

446
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,520
Thanks a lot, Jeans.

447
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,440
I’m really awful.

448
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,200
I can’t separate personal stuff from work.

449
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,920
The company’s goal is
more important than the past.

450
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,720
Right, Jeans?

451
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,720
Does that mean…

452
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,680
You're okay working with Art?

453
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,840
Yeah.

454
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,280
What?

455
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Don't worry about me.

456
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,720
Don't worry about me.

457
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,280
I’m okay now.

458
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,880
Come on, let’s celebrate!

459
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,800
Here.

460
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
Jun-chan.

461
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,640
No matter what happens,

462
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,520
we'll push forward, Boss.

463
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,280
Got it.

464
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,800
Let’s go, go, go!

465
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,040
Yeah,

466
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,520
let’s go!

467
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,320
You’re drinking...

468
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,160
You’re drinking too much. I've run out.

469
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,520
Not even a drop?

470
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,440
Bay,

471
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,040
I need all the details and design ideas

472
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,200
from the Game Designers.

473
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,000
Understood, Art.

474
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,280
And Pao,

475
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,160
send me all the Mission Level data

476
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,720
designed by the Level Designers.

477
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,080
This is urgent.

478
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Understood, Art.

479
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,560
The Level Designers
had already compiled everything.

480
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,720
That's great, Pao.

481
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,000
But if you need more specific details,

482
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,600
But if you need more specific details,

483
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,400
ask Hill.

484
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,800
He'd already went through every mission.

485
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,440
Who’s Hill?

486
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,040
Me.

487
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,080
I'm Hill.

488
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,200
A newbie.

489
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,360
Then send me the details of each mission,

490
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,520
it might be useful.

491
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,200
I want to develop this game quickly

492
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,720
and make it perfect

493
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
for Junji’s vision.

494
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,560
Thanks for coming back
to work with us again, Art.

495
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,240
Let’s look at our game development process.

496
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,760
Shall we?

497
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,200
[knocking]

498
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,480
Need something, Art?

499
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,400
Haven’t been here in a while.

500
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,440
Brings back memories of working with you.

501
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,480
Everything’s the same.

502
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,560
The room’s the same.

503
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,600
But I wonder if the owner's still the same.

504
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Junji.

505
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,280
Want to grab lunch together?

506
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,000
Maybe we can revisit the past.

507
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,120
No need.

508
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,280
But thanks.

509
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Don’t be so polite, Junji.

510
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,920
Whatever you want, it’s on me.

511
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,360
Consider it a celebration of
us working together again.

512
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,720
I brought a bento (lunchbox).

513
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,280
Okay.

514
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,440
But if you ever change your mind,

515
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,680
give me a call.

516
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,360
Wait, Art.

517
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,720
You've changed your mind about joining me?

518
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,320
No.

519
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,160
I just think it’d be better
if you called me “Boss.”

520
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Yes, Boss.

521
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,240
Is something wrong, Hill?

522
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,320
I was just about to go grab lunch.

523
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,400
Thought I’d ask if you want to join me.

524
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm good. Thanks.

525
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,360
Excuse me.

526
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,840
Wait up, Hill.

527
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,040
Get me some pork skewers, too.

528
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,120
Sure.

529
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,080
Alright, the game has begun!

530
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,000
Hill's started his first mission.

531
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,720
First mission is to hold hands with Mike!

532
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,520
Will he succeed? Let’s find out!

533
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,680
Can he do it?

534
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,720
Stay sharp.

535
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,360
Will he succeed?

536
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,280
Did he?

537
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,480
Did he do it?

538
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,880
He did it!

539
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,000
Hill's now on Mission Two!

540
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,960
Alright then.

541
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,120
Let’s switch over to Art.

542
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,240
Art’s coming in close!

543
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
Can he—?

544
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,280
Oh no. It's a no for Art.

545
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,720
Come on, buddy!

546
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,880
Meanwhile, Hill's on fire and unstoppable.

547
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,520
His flirting skills are off the charts!

548
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,000
He's got more charm than good looks.

549
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,000
Let’s see if he can win Mike over.

550
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,000
Can he do it?

551
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,160
Will it work?

552
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,720
Will he succeed

553
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
And win his heart?

554
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,280
And he did it!

555
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
He's pulled it off!

556
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Woohoo!

557
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,520
[applause]

558
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,000
Hill's amazing.

559
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,120
You completed the mission to win over Boss.

560
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,280
So you know Mike inside and out!

561
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,320
With how well he knows Boss,
who could compete with him?

562
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,920
Obviously.

563
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,160
He actually won her over in real life.

564
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Why would he lose in the game?

565
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,560
Art's the programmer,
but he still lost to Hill.

566
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,080
I may lost in the game,

567
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
but real life is different.

568
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,960
Hey…

569
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,400
That’s it for today.

570
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
Let’s play again another time.

571
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,120
Yeah, yeah.

572
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,320
Let’s go.

573
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,320
Come on, chow time!

574
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,960
Junji.

575
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,800
Why are you carrying so much stuff?

576
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,280
Be more careful next time.

577
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,080
Alright?

578
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,360
What about this?

579
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,960
Yeah,

580
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,280
that looks good.

581
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,320
Got it.

582
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,880
You’re as hardworking as ever.

583
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,120
Hey,

584
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,680
want to grab lunch in Thonglor later?

585
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,160
Lots of great places there.

586
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,600
Thanks

587
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
but I brought my own bento.

588
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,400
How about our go-to place in Ekkamai?

589
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,680
Bet it’s so good it’ll make
you forget your bento!

590
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,360
Boss.

591
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,720
I’m done here.

592
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,000
I’ll head to lunch now.

593
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,920
I’ll head to lunch now.

594
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,400
Okay.

595
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,120
Do you want pork skewers? I'll grab some.

596
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,320
Well…

597
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,240
Not today, thanks

598
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,040
I'll excuse myself, then.

599
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,320
Hill.

600
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,600
Take this with you. I made it.

601
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,080
I’ve got something to do after this,

602
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,400
so I’ll head out.

603
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,720
You’re not eating it yourself?

604
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,800
Looks like our boss is sick of bentos.

605
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,480
Let’s go to our usual spot then, Junji.

606
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,280
Thanks.

607
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,000
Figures.

608
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,040
Figures.

609
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,120
Why would I matter, right?

610
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,000
Why are you sulking, Hill?

611
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,840
I’m sulking over your friend, Phat.

612
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,960
Looks like his old flame’s been rekindled.

613
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,280
You’re jealous.

614
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,520
But…

615
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,080
What’s his ex got to do with it?

616
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,200
Do you know someone named Art?

617
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,680
He made "Yuka! Love Me Please" with Boss.

618
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,080
Art?

619
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,120
Art.

620
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,280
Who’s that?

621
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,120
Oh, right!

622
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,360
The one who nearly made
Junji quit making games?

623
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,200
Huh?

624
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,000
What happened?

625
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,120
Oh.

626
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,200
Junji once told me about
Art while feeling down.

627
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,320
Said Art wasn’t sure
if he liked Junji or not.

628
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,600
So he asked for time to figure himself out.

629
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,000
But completely disappeared.

630
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,520
But completely disappeared.

631
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,760
[sighs]

632
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,680
Poor him.

633
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,080
If it were me

634
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,360
I’d never do anything to hurt Junji-san.

635
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,440
Really?

636
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,840
If you're that confident, then go for it.

637
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,280
If you hesitate too long,
that old flame might rekindle.

638
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,760
I'm warning you.

639
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,760
I do want to go for it,

640
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,200
but I don’t know what I have to offer.

641
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,600
I’m bound to lose.

642
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,520
As far as I can tell, I think
Junji has feelings for you too.

643
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,680
But…

644
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,200
it’s impossible between me and Junji-san.

645
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,880
Why would you think that?

646
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,000
It’s just…

647
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,040
I like him.

648
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,080
I'm happy when I’m with him.

649
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,200
It makes me feel like…

650
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,880
when I’m with Yuka-chan.

651
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,120
But…

652
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,880
Yuka-chan's always a good girlfriend to me.

653
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,120
She never did anything wrong.

654
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,480
I just…

655
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,880
I still can’t move on.

656
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,600
What should I do, Phat?

657
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,160
Why do you feel guilty about Yuka?

658
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,680
I mean, Yuka and Junji are the same person.

659
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,600
What did you say?

660
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,680
Junji-san and Yuka-chan are

661
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,680
the same person?

662
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,560
What do you mean?

663
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,600
You said…

664
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,400
Junji-san and Yuka-chan
are the same person.

665
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,080
Maybe I shouldn’t say any more.

666
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,360
It's…

667
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,040
It's a secret.

668
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,280
If Junji finds out, I’m screwed.

669
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,360
If you won’t tell me,

670
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,280
then I’ll just ask Junji-san myself.

671
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,680
Damn it.

672
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,280
What's done is done…

673
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,000
Here’s the thing…

674
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,120
Yuka’s outer shell is based on Jeans.

675
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,640
But inside, she is 100% Junji.

676
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,680
You can’t tell anyone about this

677
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,000
because it’s top secret.

678
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,000
Is that true?

679
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,240
Is that true?

680
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,040
That…

681
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,920
Junji-san and Yuka-chan
being the same person?

682
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,400
Absolutely.

683
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,880
Art based Yuka's character on Junji.

684
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,600
The outer appearance was taken from Jeans.

685
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,040
But the thoughts and
emotions inside are all Junji.

686
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,680
So you don’t have to feel
guilty about Yuka anymore.

687
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,280
I mean…

688
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:31,960
I was…

689
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,640
I’ve been lied to this whole time?

690
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,480
Wait.

691
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,480
I thought you’d be happy.

692
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,600
Why are you mad?

693
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,200
(Eight years ago)

694
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,400
This is the style we’ll use.

695
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
This one.

696
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,680
Nice.

697
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,480
Okay.

698
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,040
Can you do it?

699
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,560
Actually…

700
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,880
I…

701
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,120
I’ll show you.

702
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,000
Like this.

703
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,080
How’s that?

704
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,120
Whoa.

705
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,880
That’s…

706
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,480
That’s spot on, Junji.

707
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,240
Ga

708
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,000
n

709
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,280
ba

710
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,800
tsu

711
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,280
te ne

712
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,840
Ganbatte ne!

713
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,480
So we're going with "Yuka"?

714
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,200
Mm.

715
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,080
- Yeah.
- Yuka.

716
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,040
Yeah, Yuka.

717
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,520
Yuka.

718
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,320
Cute, no?

719
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,640
Very cute.

720
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,960
Subarashii (Wonderful).

721
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,560
Subarashii.

722
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,240
Junji, let’s go eat.

723
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,920
Where did he go?

724
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,520
Is that true?

725
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,760
Junji-san and Yuka-chan
being the same person?

726
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,040
Those who play Yuka's game

727
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,880
are not playing just for fun, Phat.

728
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,280
Yuka is almost everything to me.

729
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,560
She fills what’s missing in my life.

730
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,040
Yuka-chan.

731
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,000
She’s both my hope and my strength.

732
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,360
And I’ve always been sure

733
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,680
that Yuka would never lie

734
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,400
or hurt me.

735
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,680
But now the truth is not like that.

736
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,840
Why is Junji-san so cruel?

737
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,160
Why does he have to lie to everyone?

738
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,080
The reason Junji does this

739
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,920
is because he loves this game so much,

740
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,160
and wants it to succeed.

741
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,440
And I’m sure, people like Junji

742
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,520
never intend to hurt others’ feelings.

743
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,920
Easy creamy tom yum recipe,
flavorful but not too spicy.

744
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,000
I think this recipe is suitable,
since you can't handle spicy food.

745
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,160
Don't give up.

746
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,280
Hill.

747
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,560
You're the best.

748
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
Ganbatte ne!

749
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,680
Don't give up, Hill.

750
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,720
Ganbatte ne!

751
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,480
Ganbatte ne!

752
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,840
I’m sure you can do it.

753
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,240
I'll be waiting for the day you succeed.

754
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,280
Give it all you've got, Hill.

755
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,360
Ganbatte ne!

756
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,760
I’ve got something to do after this,

757
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,400
so I’ll head out.

758
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,040
Hill.

759
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
- Ganbatte ne!
- Ganbatte ne!

760
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:12,960
Crap!

761
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,520
You okay, kid?!

762
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,240
Boss,

763
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,560
wait for me.

764
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,800
Ganbatte ne!

765
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,240
Weirdo.

766
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Let’s go back to how we were.

767
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,400
Please?

768
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,320
Will you give me a chance?

769
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,240
Now I know how I truly feel.

770
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,120
Junji, you're the answer.

771
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,800
Give me one more chance, Junji.

772
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,320
Don't!

773
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,280
Our new game has a sponsor now.

774
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,040
I want everyone to scout for

775
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,440
the spot for the game’s ending scene.

776
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,400
I’ve been reflecting all this time that

777
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,000
I want to give this love a try.

778
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,680
Don’t say anything just yet.

779
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,480
If one day you find out…

780
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,880
Yuka lied to you,

781
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
would you be angry?

782
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,480
Now that I know where my heart is.

783
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,160
I'll stand by Junji’s side again.
