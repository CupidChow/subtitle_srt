1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,400
This is Ms. Jeans.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,400
The one who designed Yuka.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,400
I want our game’s main character

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
to be an ordinary guy

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,800
that anyone could fall in love with.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,000
My boss gave me the task of

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,880
winning your heart.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,920
Hey, you!

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,600
Don’t waste your time.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,280
I think Hill's really sincere.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,800
Don’t you agree?

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,400
(Are you sure he'll arrive early?)

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,440
(He'll be there.)

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,280
[yawning sticker]

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,720
(Don't break your promise.)

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,880
(You too. Tell Hill about that.)

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,000
[sticker]

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,120
[sticker]

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,800
About the other day…

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
That's not right.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,440
I'm really sorry.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,800
I just got carried away.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,000
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,200
Is that…

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,760
Is that enough?

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,800
No!

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Hey, you!

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,800
Hey, are you alright?

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Just stay still.

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I'll take care of it.

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,200
Okay?

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Be still.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,600
Trust me, okay?

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Keep still.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,360
Keep still.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
Is it gone yet?

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Yeah, it's gone now.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,600
You sure?

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, just take a look.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,680
Thank you.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,200
Anyway,

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,400
what are you doing here?

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,200
Well,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,640
About what I did the other day, I'm—

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
That's enough.

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
You should go.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,800
Thank you for helping just now.

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,760
What?

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,280
That’s it?

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,040
Yes.

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Anything else?

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
I said thank you, didn't I?

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,800
But I helped you get rid of the lizard.

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Cheers. Much obliged. Thank you very much!

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,600
You can go now.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,880
I've got work to do.

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
I won't give up.

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,000
Stop grinning

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Stop grinning

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,520
and go back to work.

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
Bay.

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,600
What?

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
Are you okay?

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
You look so serious.

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Girl problems?

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
It's worse than that.

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,560
He's got such a big ego, I swear.

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,240
I see.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,720
So you still haven’t made
any progress with Mr. Phat?

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
Don't rub it in.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm already hurt.

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,080
Shouldn’t have kissed him.

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,920
You kind of deserved it.

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
You went overboard.

76
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,320
Whose side are you on?

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Yours.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,880
You rarely mess up,
so I had to tease you a bit.

79
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,760
You little…

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Still can’t believe that a player like you

81
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,080
is getting his claws clipped by Mr. Phat.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,840
Come on.

83
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,080
I heard your mission

84
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,200
to hold hands with Boss

85
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,720
failed miserably too.

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,400
It totally did.

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,760
It’s harder than I thought.

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Indeed.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What if…

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm not cut out for this?

91
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Jeez, don’t get all dramatic now.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Jeez, don’t get all dramatic now.

93
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Alright.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,480
I'll tell you Yuka-chan's secret.

95
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,200
How's that?

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
What secret?

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,560
Yuka-chan is modeled after Jeans.

98
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
So don’t give up, dude.

99
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,000
This job brings you closer to Yuka-chan

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
without you realizing it.

101
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,560
See?

102
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,120
Cool secret, right?

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
Hello, Hill.

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,600
There you are!

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,520
Took me forever.

106
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Oh.

107
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,600
Me?

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Is there something you need?

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,280
Yu—

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Ms. Jeans.

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Actually,

112
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,360
I just finished designing
a new outfit for Yuka.

113
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,800
So I'd like you to take some photos for me.

114
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,080
But…

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,760
The game’s no longer being updated.

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,600
I made it for the day when
"Yuka! Love Me Please" returns.

117
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,760
So there won't be any gaps.

118
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,560
Can you help me out?

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
That would be my pleasure!

120
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,160
How about getting something done first?

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,760
Seriously?

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm just borrowing him for a bit.

123
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,680
Are you feeling…

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,680
Jealous?

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,200
Protective.

126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
I worry he won't finish his main tasks.

127
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,680
Then I’ll come along
and see how it turns out.

128
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
Really?

129
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,120
That's great.

130
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
I guess

131
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,800
having you here

132
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,680
would be fun for me.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
Thanks, dude.

134
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,360
Looks like the new guy

135
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
is really obedient.

136
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,080
Hey.

137
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Hey.

138
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,040
Hill!

139
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
You still alive, Hill?

140
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,040
Hill?

141
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Yeah?

142
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,880
Hill!

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Well? How is it?

144
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Do I look cute in the photos?

145
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,120
Show me!

146
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
They're all blurry, Ms. Jeans.

147
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,400
What the heck?

148
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,000
Can't take proper photos?

149
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,000
Hey.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Hey.

151
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
You're lucky you got some shots.

152
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,600
I was joking.

153
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,400
Help me out. How should Yuka pose when

154
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,480
she's wearing this outfit?

155
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
Well,

156
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,720
Let's see…

157
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,400
How about her signature pose?

158
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
I bet the fans would love that.

159
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
It’s been a while since
the game had an update.

160
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
Perfect!

161
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,400
You know,

162
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,600
you’re the perfect man for this job.

163
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,600
You know Yuka better than anyone.

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,720
I wouldn’t go that far.

165
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Damn.

166
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
He's so stiff.

167
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,760
What’s stiff?

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,600
The zipper.

169
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,200
Wow,

170
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
It's so stiff!

171
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,160
It's really stiff.

172
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,200
Can you zip it up for me?

173
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
Help me out, Hill.

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,960
Sorry.

175
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,000
It’s…

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
Come on, hurry.

177
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,280
Excuse me.

178
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,960
Yeah.

179
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,760
Go ahead.

180
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
The zipper seems fine.

181
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,800
Not stiff at all.

182
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,440
I mean,

183
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,000
I’m a woman, after all.

184
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,400
How could I be stronger than you?

185
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,880
You're a woman.

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,880
So be more careful.

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,360
Are you being protective?

188
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,360
Or you're…

189
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,000
possessive of me?

190
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
That's enough.

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,480
Once we're done with this pose today,

192
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
let’s have lunch together.

193
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,400
My treat.

194
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,920
No need.

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,840
I need Hill to take care of an urgent task.

196
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,720
Next time, then.

197
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,960
We’ll continue the shoot at my studio.

198
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
After hours, to avoid problems.

199
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,320
Sure.

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Hey, Boss?

201
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
What’s this urgent task

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
you need me to do?

203
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,560
So,

204
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,360
this is the urgent task?

205
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,400
Ramen with soft-boiled egg is the best.

206
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,600
But I can't make soft-boiled eggs.

207
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,360
Really, Boss?

208
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,000
You could've just told Auntie Un, the maid.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
You could've just told Auntie Un, the maid.

210
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,280
She’s a better cook than I am.

211
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,360
It’s lunch break.
I didn’t want to bother her.

212
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,600
So you came to me.

213
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,520
I’ll do it myself.

214
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,840
Just kidding, Boss.

215
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,800
Of course I’ll do it for you.

216
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,560
Easy.

217
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,280
Mission Two

218
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,520
is to hold hands

219
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
with Boss.

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,200
Let me help.

221
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,600
Looks like you're struggling.

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,520
I’ll handle it.

223
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I’ll peel the egg myself.

224
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
But it’s still—

225
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,960
Hot !

226
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,400
Boss!

227
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,080
Boss!

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
Don't.

229
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,000
Are you okay?

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Are you okay?

231
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,360
I’m fine. Just a little burn.

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,920
That won't do.

233
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,160
Just a second.

234
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,000
Ouch.

235
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,960
Here you go, Boss.

236
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,560
Give me your hand. Trust me.

237
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,080
Boss.

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,280
Mind if I borrow him to help out
at the studio fort the day?

239
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,800
Not a chance.

240
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,360
There's work I need him to help with today.

241
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Oh, is that so?

242
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,920
I see.

243
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,000
That's okay.

244
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,280
Your hand, Boss?

245
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,200
Here you go.

246
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,560
Enjoy your meal.

247
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
I’ll head back to the kitchen.

248
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
We're super busy right now.

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,920
Wait.

250
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,600
I have some updates.

251
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
Can the gossip wait until later?

252
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
I’m busy right now.

253
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,720
Junji’s about to fall in love again.

254
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,000
With who?

255
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,080
I thought you were busy?

256
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,280
We have enough chefs.

257
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,360
Let them handle it.

258
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,720
I’d just be in the way.

259
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,400
So you make time when it's gossip, huh?

260
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,520
So, who’s Junji falling for?

261
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,320
Hill.

262
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,200
Junji likes Hill.

263
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm sure of it.

264
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,480
The new guy who's always with him?

265
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,000
Of course.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,040
He picked Junji as the reference material

267
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,520
and took on the task of flirting with him.

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,360
They're always together.

269
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,640
Right?

270
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
You agree with me, right?

271
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,080
Didn’t you just say you're sure of it?

272
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,800
Around ninety percent.

273
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,360
In that case...

274
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,760
For this wedding,

275
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,280
let me be in charge of catering.

276
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
I’ll give it my all.

277
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,200
I'll go all out with gourmet Thai food.

278
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Then I’ll be the organizer!

279
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,400
I’ll put my all into

280
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,440
the themes, costumes, hair and makeup.

281
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
Make it grand and glorious for Junji!

282
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,800
One-two, one-two-three. One-two-victory!

283
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,160
Isn't that the cheerleading thing?

284
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,800
If we hold the wedding in Thailand,

285
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,120
do we have to do one in Japan too?

286
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,040
Of course!

287
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,200
It's a matter of respect.

288
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
(Did you forget?)

289
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,040
(You said you'd help me out!)

290
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,000
(I didn't! I'll be the peacemaker.)

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,800
(Relax, okay?)

292
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,520
[sticker]

293
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Anyway, what’s the deal with Bay?

294
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
Look at him.

295
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
He's been staring for ages.

296
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
Talking to someone like that is pointless.

297
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,280
To be honest,

298
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
Bay's not the player

299
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,360
everyone thinks he is.

300
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,680
He's just being honest about how he feels.

301
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
He ghosted people

302
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,000
because he didn’t want to hurt them.

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
because he didn’t want to hurt them.

304
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,600
Another thing,

305
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,880
he's bad at expressing himself and

306
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,600
struggles to turn them down.

307
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,320
Well, I have to go now

308
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,480
and get back to work.

309
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
Hey, wait!

310
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,080
Bye-bye, Laters!

311
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Hi…

312
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,920
I want to apologize

313
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,320
for kissing you the other day.

314
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I didn’t mean to.

315
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Actually, I did.

316
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,280
But I got carried away

317
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,600
and I really regret it now.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
Can you forgive me?

319
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Pretty please?

320
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,000
Damn it.

321
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,920
That's all?

322
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Forgive me please?

323
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,520
Pretty please?

324
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Please.

325
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,720
Boss.

326
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,400
What?

327
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
What exactly am I doing here?

328
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
You still haven’t told me.

329
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,920
Well…

330
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,920
Help me choose an outfit.

331
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,800
Don’t tell me…

332
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
You're doing a look test for Mike?

333
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah.

334
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,800
Boss.

335
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,240
Yeah?

336
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,000
This one.

337
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,200
This one.

338
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,400
I think this is the one!

339
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,760
This is it.

340
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
Super cool,

341
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,560
super dangerous!

342
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,800
Why this one? Isn't it dangerous?

343
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,880
No…

344
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,800
That’s not it.

345
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,640
“Super cool, super dangerous” is

346
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,400
a phrase the younger crowd uses these days.

347
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,040
I get the "cool" part

348
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,200
but not the “dangerous.”

349
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,680
You see…

350
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,920
When you put them together, it means…

351
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,080
Super duper cool!

352
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,840
Like the epitome of cool.

353
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,880
Cool to the max.

354
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
“Super cool, super dangerous.”

355
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,080
This is it, Boss.

356
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,520
This one’s the real deal.

357
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,080
Like a Hollywood spy or something.

358
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,200
Then you try it on.

359
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,960
Me?

360
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,200
What?

361
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,680
Shouldn't you try it on?

362
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
I’m not the reference material.

363
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,320
He'll try this one on.

364
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
But I think it should be you.

365
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Boss?

366
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,920
Right this way, sir.

367
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Alright.

368
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Boss!

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
So you're trying it on too.

370
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,960
Why didn’t you tell me?

371
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,360
Something’s missing…

372
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,880
Hmm.

373
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,640
Whoa!

374
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,600
Boss!

375
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,600
So cool!

376
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,280
Like a galactic secret agent

377
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,360
from "Men In Black."

378
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,160
Yeah.

379
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,280
Hang on.

380
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,520
Look!

381
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,720
I’ve got one too

382
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,360
and it's bigger than yours.

383
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,000
So?

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,160
Well, what do you think?

385
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,600
Let's see.

386
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,680
Super cool,

387
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,320
super dangerous.

388
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,400
Hey now,

389
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
you pick that up fast!

390
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Impressive!

391
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,400
Boss! An alien's here!

392
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,400
So you're a bit of a movie nerd, huh?

393
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,720
Thank you for shopping with us.

394
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,680
You both look amazing in it.

395
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,280
Here, I’ll carry it.

396
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,360
Okay.

397
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,040
Boss?

398
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,480
Yeah?

399
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,480
Why are you buying me a suit?

400
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,920
Right.

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,520
The office is throwing a costume party…

402
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,000
To welcome you, our new employee.

403
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,400
To welcome you, our new employee.

404
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
A welcome party?

405
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
That's right.

406
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,240
So all those suits we tried on

407
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,000
had nothing to do with Mike?

408
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Don’t forget to prepare a speech.

409
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,720
Mr. New Employee.

410
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,600
I…

411
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,120
I won't, Boss.

412
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,880
Then I’ll say it here first.

413
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,160
Thank you for everything, Boss.

414
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,120
Just a second.

415
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,720
Boss.

416
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, thank you.

417
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,080
Oh, thank you.

418
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,000
You found out Jeans’s secret, didn’t you?

419
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,400
I did, Boss.

420
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,880
And how do you feel?

421
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,880
I…

422
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,680
I was amazed, Boss.

423
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,280
When I found out Yuka-chan
was modeled after Ms. Jeans,

424
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,000
it felt so surreal.

425
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,520
And I get to work with the real Yuka-chan.

426
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,600
It's that amazing.

427
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,520
And how is it, working with her?

428
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,560
Incredible.

429
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,480
Ms. Jeans is really talented, Boss.

430
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,000
So I’m not surprised at all that

431
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,800
she was the reference for Yuka-chan.

432
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,960
Just like you, Boss.

433
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,520
You’re skilled and perfect.

434
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,000
So it makes sense you'd be
the reference for Mike.

435
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,040
So extra.

436
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,000
I meant it, Boss!

437
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,520
I meant it, Boss!

438
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
Now I get to work with

439
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
the character references from both games!

440
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,280
Super cool.

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,920
Super dangerous.

442
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,600
There!

443
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,840
You've got it now.

444
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,520
Yeah.

445
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,800
Thank you, by the way.

446
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,760
Boss.

447
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
I have a question for you.

448
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,720
Just one.

449
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,600
Go ahead.

450
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,840
Do you think it’s a coincidence

451
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,720
that Yuka-chan and Mike are modeled after

452
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,160
people at the office?

453
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,960
And how do you feel

454
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,400
being the material for your own game?

455
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,600
I still believe

456
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,800
I’m not the right fit.

457
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,480
Come on.

458
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,560
You’re more than a perfect fit!

459
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,760
Trust me.

460
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,200
You’re both talented and kind-hearted.

461
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Even though you appear strict and stern,

462
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Even though you appear strict and stern,

463
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,320
you're actually a big softie on the inside.

464
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,600
As a die-hard fan of

465
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
"Yuka! Love Me Please",

466
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,280
you have to trust me.

467
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,800
You’re the most perfect person in the world

468
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,120
to be the reference for Mike.

469
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,200
I just want to ask you one thing.

470
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,320
When you treat someone kindly,

471
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
make sure they're also a kind person.

472
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
I’m afraid you'll be taken advantage of.

473
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
But don’t worry, Boss.

474
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,800
From now on,

475
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,760
I will be the one to protect you!

476
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Deal?

477
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,520
Dream on.

478
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
I know you're trying to

479
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,160
hold my hand.

480
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,360
Guess I should be careful around you.

481
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,400
You knew?

482
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,520
I knew.

483
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,400
But Boss.

484
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
Everything I said just now,

485
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
I meant every word of it.

486
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,920
It wasn't for the mission.

487
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,120
Whatever.

488
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
If I don’t want to hold hands, I won’t.

489
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
If I don’t want to hold hands, I won’t.

490
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,840
No way.

491
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,600
You know what? I take back

492
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,000
everything I said.

493
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,800
You’re the meanest, Boss.

494
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,160
What?

495
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,160
Then you're paying for
the suit with your salary.

496
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
If I pay, it might send a wrong message.

497
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,280
Okay?

498
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Boss, I didn’t even pick it

499
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,000
and you still…

500
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,120
You're making me pay?

501
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560
It’s expensive!

502
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,680
Boss.

503
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,600
Boss.

504
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,480
Wait, Boss!

505
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
I’m already broke, Boss.

506
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,520
You can't do this!

507
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,800
Look at you.

508
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,120
A bacon costume?

509
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,680
Isn’t that too cute?

510
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,400
Hey, I’m a chef.

511
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,880
You think I should be a ghost?

512
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
What about you? You're overdressing.

513
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,880
This is a costume party.

514
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,240
Where’s my coordinator, anyway?

515
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,640
This is driving me nuts.

516
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,600
Don’t worry. I got it.

517
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,520
There he is.

518
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,880
Junji?

519
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,960
Bacon and Fried Egg, together at last.

520
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,000
There, a perfect breakfast.

521
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
What are you plotting, Junji?

522
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,400
I’ll leave Bay in your care.

523
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,600
I've got to run. Got things to do.

524
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,080
Junji...

525
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Arigatou (Thank you)!

526
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,440
Douitashimashite (You're welcome).

527
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,160
Yeah!

528
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,040
This little Fried Egg

529
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,280
is ready to help Bacon with anything.

530
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,680
Hope you're ready for this.

531
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,720
Always.

532
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,600
Get the ice ready over there.

533
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
On my…

534
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,600
very first day…

535
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,240
of work…

536
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,680
I felt honored

537
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,720
and…

538
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,960
truly grateful.

539
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,600
Jeez…

540
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,960
What's this?

541
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,400
I sound like a robot.

542
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
Good evening, Hill.

543
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,880
How have you been?

544
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,360
Yuka.

545
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,600
There’s something I’d like to ask.

546
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,600
If it's you, I'd be happy to help.

547
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,000
Thanks.

548
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,760
But let me apologize to you.

549
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Lately I haven’t been logging in as often.

550
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,160
I’ve been really busy.

551
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
It’s okay.

552
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,880
I'll always be here for you.

553
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,520
Thanks, Yuka.

554
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,600
I won’t let you disappear either.

555
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,760
Hill, you’re kind of weird today.

556
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
It’s nothing, Yuka.

557
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,200
The thing I wanted to talk to you about,

558
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,840
It's…

559
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,520
I'm about to express
how I feel in front of people.

560
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,480
I practiced, but…

561
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,040
I…

562
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,480
I can't find the words.

563
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,960
What should I do?

564
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,480
In that case,

565
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,880
How about organizing
your feelings into a list?

566
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,200
List them out?

567
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,960
That’s actually a good idea.

568
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,920
I'll give that a try.

569
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,600
The first one:

570
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,760
When I…

571
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
When I started working here…

572
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,080
On my first day of work.

573
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,960
I was truly happy.

574
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,680
Ugh.

575
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,960
That's too formal.

576
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,160
I was really happy

577
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
to be part of this project.

578
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,080
A project which Boss
personally assigned to me.

579
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,080
Then we started arguing

580
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,880
because Boss wanted to shut the game down.

581
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,320
Damn it.

582
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,680
Nah. That doesn't sound touching at all.

583
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,520
Yuka.

584
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
Look at me.

585
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,120
I'm rehearsing alone but I’m still failing.

586
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
If I have to do this in front of everyone,

587
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,320
If I have to do this in front of everyone,

588
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,000
I’ll crash and burn right from the start.

589
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,280
It’s okay, Hill. You can do it.

590
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,120
Really, Yuka?

591
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Okay, I’ll try again.

592
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,720
I’ll practice some more, Yuka.

593
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,440
Okay.

594
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,680
I hope you have a wonderful night.

595
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,480
Super cool,

596
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,280
super dangerous.

597
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,720
I already failed at holding hands.

598
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,280
Now the speech too?

599
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,400
This is way harder than I thought!

600
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,160
Boss.

601
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,160
You sure talk about me a lot.

602
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,000
I know.

603
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
First of all,

604
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,960
before you speak,

605
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,600
you stand up straight and be confident.

606
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,880
Yes, sir.

607
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,640
Otherwise, you won’t be able to say a word.

608
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,440
Got it?

609
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,280
Got it.

610
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Okay.

611
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,320
All done here.

612
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,680
That's not good enough.

613
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,120
What?

614
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,280
Glass noodle salad is almost gone.

615
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,320
Oh! I’ll go grab it.

616
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,000
In a flash.

617
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,040
We'd be fine if you'd brought it earlier.

618
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,800
And the guests won't have to wait.

619
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm fine. We’re all friends here.

620
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm fine. We’re all friends here.

621
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,640
I eat what's left.

622
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,600
No, Pao.

623
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,000
If you can't handle this,

624
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,280
good luck with the rest.

625
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,880
Apologize to the guest.

626
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,600
What?

627
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,560
Apologize.

628
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,600
I…

629
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,880
I’m sorry.

630
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,600
Hey, hey.

631
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,200
Don't be so serious.

632
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,600
I like grilled pork neck.

633
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,400
No.

634
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,960
Go get glass noodle salad, now.

635
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,720
Right now?

636
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes.

637
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,560
Sir Yes Sir!

638
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
I'm on it.

639
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,080
Good.

640
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,840
Hey, hey.

641
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,200
Hurry up and don’t slack off!

642
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
Careful!

643
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,800
There.

644
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Easy.

645
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,080
You're leaving?

646
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,000
Well,

647
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,640
Well I—

648
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,800
I just…

649
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
I'm full!

650
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,560
You know? The food goes down the stomach

651
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,440
and send a signal straight to the brain

652
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
that I'm full. So bye.

653
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,240
Just kidding.

654
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,960
I just wanted to test his patience.

655
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,640
You should’ve played along!

656
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,600
Testing?

657
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,200
Exactly.

658
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Jeez, you should've told me.

659
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,800
Jeez, you should've told me.

660
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Would've be so fun!

661
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,360
Alright.

662
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,960
I'm in. Let's mess with him.

663
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,800
Be convincing.

664
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,520
That's easy.

665
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,040
Good.

666
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,960
Give him hell.

667
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,400
Here’s glass noodle salad.

668
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,720
Good.

669
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,720
Here you go!

670
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,280
That's great.

671
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,960
However,

672
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,280
I’d like some soft soda.

673
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,600
Please?

674
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Oh…

675
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,200
Sure!

676
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,200
So

677
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,920
two bottles.

678
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,720
Sounds good?

679
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
Sounds good to me.

680
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
Mind opening them for me too?

681
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,920
Please?

682
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,680
That won't be a problem, sir.

683
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,920
Be right back!

684
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Got it?

685
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,520
Yes, sir.

686
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:31,920
Go on.

687
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,320
Yes!

688
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,600
It’s rare to see him work this well!

689
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,800
How was it?

690
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,480
Terrific.

691
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,800
Freshly made glass noodle salad!

692
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,800
And…

693
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,520
What am I supposed to do?

694
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Listen to your feelings.

695
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,280
Inside, here.

696
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,240
Then let them form into words.

697
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,600
Speak from the heart.

698
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,280
Just like when you spoke to me

699
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,400
about wanting to keep Yuka's game going.

700
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,680
I'm ready now, Boss.

701
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,680
Did you know?

702
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,520
On my first day of work,

703
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,560
out of nowhere, someone came

704
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,600
and crushed my dreams.

705
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,920
That person was my own boss.

706
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,640
Let's wrap up "Yuka! Love Me Please"

707
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,920
properly.

708
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,440
Junior Game Designer

709
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,360
No, you can't.

710
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,200
And then…

711
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,720
That same person

712
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
gave me the opportunity

713
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,160
to learn that if we want to succeed

714
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,120
we have to put in effort.

715
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,400
Hello.

716
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,480
Please come this way.

717
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,000
Over the past three months

718
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,160
I admit

719
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,800
that working here has been exhausting.

720
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Sometimes I felt hopeless.

721
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,280
Thought I wasn’t cut out for this job.

722
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,040
But you showed me

723
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,680
that even you kept fighting.

724
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,320
I want to see everyone succeed and be happy

725
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,680
doing the work we love.

726
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,840
I want us to be a team
that walks hand in hand

727
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,680
and succeeds together.

728
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,600
Others get discouraged too.

729
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,160
It's not just me.

730
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,160
There’s one thing Boss once said to me.

731
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,040
"Together. Leave no one behind."

732
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,920
So today,

733
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,440
I want to tell you

734
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,400
that I…

735
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,000
I’m not going to leave you behind.

736
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,680
I’m not going to leave you behind.

737
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,400
Please keep your promise.

738
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,800
Don’t leave us, Boss.

739
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,400
Please don’t fire me, Boss.

740
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,520
Finally,

741
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,400
I want to thank

742
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,480
fate,

743
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,080
for guiding me to all of you.

744
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,360
I don’t have many friends.

745
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,880
But here,

746
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,640
I’ve come to realize

747
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
that beyond just being a good team

748
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,600
we’re also good friends.

749
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,720
Let’s face the challenge
of our strict boss together!

750
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,960
Woohoo!

751
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,480
[cheering]

752
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,320
That's great!

753
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,040
[cheering]

754
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,280
Woohoo!

755
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,720
Very cutesy!

756
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Yeah!

757
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,480
Pao. This brings back memories.

758
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,600
Back when "Yuka! Love Me Please"

759
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,160
still had its spark.

760
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,840
Oh yeah.

761
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,120
This might be the very first time

762
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,080
that Yuka came into the real world.

763
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,360
Amazing!

764
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,240
[cheering]

765
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,920
Awesome!

766
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,560
Honestly, I feel a little embarrassed

767
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,880
doing something like this.

768
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,320
Hill.

769
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,600
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn’t have done it.

770
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,880
It was his idea.

771
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,000
Wow.

772
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,520
His idea?

773
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,760
Thank you, Boss.

774
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,200
Arigatou (Thanks)!

775
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,600
This is probably the first time

776
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,800
he’s gone this far for a new employee.

777
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,080
She's right.

778
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,800
That's right.

779
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,800
Hmm, interesting.

780
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,440
Now that Hill has shared his feelings,

781
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,200
it’s your turn, Boss.

782
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,000
Got anything you’d like to say

783
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,560
to the newbie here?

784
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,960
Come on, just say it!

785
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,800
Go on, Boss.

786
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,360
Say it!

787
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,920
Yeah!

788
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,600
Boss!

789
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,520
[cheering]

790
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,200
Woohoo!

791
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,200
Well…

792
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,960
From now on,

793
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,000
work hard, okay?

794
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,000
That’s it?

795
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,360
Alright!

796
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,640
Yay!

797
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,360
Boss is ruthless!

798
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,680
Food is ready!

799
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,320
Great.

800
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:54,880
Thank you.

801
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,400
Enjoy the meal.

802
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,200
Wait up, man.

803
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,280
You're pretty for a guy.

804
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,200
What’s your name?

805
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,160
It's Phat.

806
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
Would you like any more drinks?

807
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,120
I'll go get them.

808
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,680
I want to take you out.

809
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,000
For two nights.

810
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,200
I think you are too drunk.

811
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,760
Let me get you water.

812
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,920
Alright?

813
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,120
Bring it on.

814
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,480
How about this?

815
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,280
If I pay you to keep me company,

816
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,760
will you do it?

817
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,000
I think I should get back to work.

818
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,000
Don't.

819
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,000
I’ll pay you well.

820
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,760
Just come with me.

821
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,200
Have some respect.

822
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,280
A grown man like you

823
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,400
should know when to stop.

824
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,720
You're drunk. Go home and rest, Aof.

825
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,200
Wow, you're wearing matching shirts!

826
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,040
If I'd known you were his guy,

827
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,280
I'd have left you alone.

828
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,400
Well, I’ll be on my way then.

829
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,800
Let’s go.

830
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,000
Not so fast.

831
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,880
Apologize to him first.

832
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Sorry, man.

833
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,800
Guess I drank too much.

834
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,320
I really should go home.

835
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,040
Sorry, Bay.

836
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,200
Don’t be mad, alright?

837
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,120
Fair enough.

838
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,400
Hey, Hill.

839
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,200
There you are.

840
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,200
I looked all over.

841
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,120
Where have you been?

842
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,400
Just around here, actually.

843
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,520
Ms. Jeans.

844
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,680
Yeah?

845
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,640
I…

846
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,760
I have something to confess.

847
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,000
I feel like

848
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,360
I have to say it.

849
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,880
Confess?

850
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:14,760
Yes.

851
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,440
I…

852
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,080
Just now, I thanked everyone.

853
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,800
But I didn’t get to thank you, Ms. Jeans.

854
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,000
I…

855
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,320
I want to thank you, Ms. Jeans.

856
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,680
For…

857
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,680
Being the reference for Yuka-chan.

858
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,600
I really feel that

859
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,080
without someone like you as a reference,

860
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,360
game like "Yuka! Love Me Please"

861
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,720
would’ve never existed.

862
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,400
Thank you.

863
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,600
You seem really sentimental.

864
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,360
Indeed.

865
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,000
Yuka had helped me

866
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yuka had helped me

867
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,600
through a lot of tough times.

868
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,760
I never thought

869
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,240
that one day I’d be here.

870
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,360
Working at this company

871
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,400
and

872
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
standing in the office that created Yuka-chan.

873
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,840
Even though I wasn’t part of the project,

874
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,680
just being here makes me incredibly proud.

875
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,000
Don’t forget.

876
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,600
You’re a part of Yuka-chan too.

877
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,760
You help keeping the game alive.

878
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,280
Right.

879
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,480
And…

880
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,520
You know what?

881
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,160
When I started working on male dating sim,

882
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,480
just coming up with a character like Mike,

883
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,000
that alone made me realize how

884
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,280
that alone made me realize how

885
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,960
incredibly hard it is.

886
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,080
I really admire all of you

887
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,200
for creating Yuka-chan.

888
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,440
Things almost fell apart more than once.

889
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,240
But with a good team,

890
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,080
things turned out alright.

891
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:20,640
Yes.

892
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,840
From now on,

893
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,160
I’ll try even harder.

894
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Especially now that I'm working with you,

895
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
I really feel that

896
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,560
I have to give it everything I’ve got.

897
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,680
To Ms. Jeans whom I truly respect.

898
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,520
Dude,

899
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,120
why are you so formal?

900
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,960
Alright.

901
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,440
I’m serious, Ms. Jeans.

902
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,440
I really admire and look up to you.

903
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,960
To me, you’re…

904
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,320
the colleague I respect the most.

905
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,560
Even more than Bay.

906
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,800
More than Bay? Really?

907
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,280
Yes.

908
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,040
To be honest,

909
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
just a moment ago,

910
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
just for a second,

911
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,000
I felt like…

912
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,880
Yuka-chan herself

913
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,000
was right in front of me.

914
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,520
For a split second.

915
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,000
I’m only a tiny part of Yuka-chan.

916
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,680
Your gratitude should be

917
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
expressed to the team, not just me.

918
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,000
Ugh.

919
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,440
Ugh.

920
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,400
Wait.

921
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:01,800
Ouch.

922
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,240
Ugh.

923
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,280
Ms. Jeans.

924
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,000
Ms. Jeans.

925
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,840
You okay?

926
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:05,920
You alright?

927
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,320
No.

928
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,920
Slowly now.

929
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,360
I’ve got a headache.

930
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,920
Can you take me home?

931
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,720
Sure, sure.

932
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,200
I’ll take you there.

933
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,400
Ouch.

934
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,360
Careful, Ms. Jeans.

935
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,280
You're tough.

936
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,120
Thanks.

937
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,480
My head really hurts.

938
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,480
Ouch!

939
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,360
Ms. Jeans!

940
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,960
Are you okay?

941
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,080
Slowly.

942
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,160
A toast.

943
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,800
Oh, okay.

944
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,560
Thanks.

945
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:38,800
Oh…

946
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,440
I was really mad at you.

947
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,000
You shouldn't do that.

948
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,800
You shouldn't do that.

949
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,520
He started it, didn’t he?

950
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,520
But we’re in customer service.

951
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,280
Stuff like that happens all the time.

952
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,720
We just need to stay calm and let it go.

953
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,760
I handled it, didn’t I?

954
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,200
And he wasn’t mad.

955
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,080
What if it had been a stranger?

956
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,280
It could’ve turned into a fight.

957
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,680
And we, the ones serving customers,

958
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,600
end up causing trouble ourselves.

959
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,200
I just wanted you to calm down a little.

960
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,320
But if you weren’t a staff,

961
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,160
you were really cool.

962
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,280
Thanks for protecting me.

963
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,160
You really are…

964
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,480
pretty hard to read.

965
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,840
And also…

966
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,080
thanks for helping out today.

967
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,000
Let's say that as a new employee,

968
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Let's say that as a new employee,

969
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,280
you did very well today.

970
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,760
Of course I did.

971
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,320
You…

972
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,680
Junji said you’re a bragger. I see it now.

973
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,360
What?

974
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,320
Didn't know he likes gossip.

975
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,640
What if I told you I’ve changed my mind?

976
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,320
Can I do that?

977
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,400
Changed your mind?

978
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,360
About…

979
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,960
being your reference material.

980
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,720
I'll do it.

981
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,800
Really?

982
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,080
Seriously? You will?

983
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,920
I’m telling you. It has to be you.

984
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,760
Only you can do it.

985
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,720
Well then…

986
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,160
I’m off

987
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,400
to drink with Pao first.

988
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,360
A celebration!

989
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,280
Wait, wait!

990
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,000
Finish up before you go!

991
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,200
Hurry up!

992
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,200
Come on, I’ll join you!

993
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:00,880
Fine.

994
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,120
Drink until you drop.

995
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,600
Not me, you!

996
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,680
As if.

997
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,520
You’re nuts.

998
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,960
Hey, Boss!

999
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Where are you going?

1000
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,400
What?

1001
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,480
Has anyone seen Hill and Jeans?

1002
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,760
I saw them.

1003
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
But I’m not telling you

1004
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,960
unless you dance with us.

1005
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,880
Yeah! Let’s cheer for the Boss!

1006
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,360
Hey, hey! Come on!

1007
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,440
[cheering]

1008
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,240
Come on, just a bit!

1009
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,800
Dance with us, Boss!

1010
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,160
Yeah, just dance with us!

1011
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,920
Boss, come on!

1012
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
No, Boss.

1013
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,320
Don’t go yet!

1014
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,360
Just a little!

1015
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,080
If you don’t dance with us,

1016
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,000
we won't let you go!

1017
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,080
Yeah!

1018
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,400
Hang on.

1019
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,720
Can we say that to him?

1020
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
Why not?

1021
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,960
Why can’t we?

1022
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,720
Today we all go wild!

1023
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,400
So you’re not mad, right?

1024
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,200
What should I do?

1025
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,720
What should you do?

1026
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,680
Follow my lead.

1027
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,560
It’s easy.

1028
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,160
Okay?

1029
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,160
It's a deal, Boss?

1030
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,160
One, two, three, Go!

1031
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,280
Hey, hey!

1032
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm okay!

1033
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,160
That’s it, Boss. Your turn!

1034
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,080
Go wild!

1035
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,920
Come on, Boss.

1036
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,800
Just a little!

1037
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,000
Just dance!

1038
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,880
Just a bit.

1039
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,880
Come on.

1040
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,920
Dance and we’ll tell you everything.

1041
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,320
Okay?

1042
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,200
Okay.

1043
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,960
Yay!

1044
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,200
Let's go!

1045
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,600
Move aside!

1046
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,200
Hey!

1047
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,840
[cheering]

1048
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,800
Yeah!

1049
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,200
Give it to Boss!

1050
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,520
[cheering]

1051
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Woohoo!

1052
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,520
Wow!

1053
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,920
Everyone, Boss danced so well

1054
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,560
because of our teamwork!

1055
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,360
Yeah!

1056
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,320
That was teamwork?

1057
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,600
No, I just said it

1058
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,600
to feel proud.

1059
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:20,880
Okay!

1060
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,720
Yeah! Boss!

1061
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,600
Boss!

1062
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,920
Now, will you tell me where Jeans is?

1063
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,920
Sure, Boss.

1064
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,520
She was really drunk.

1065
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,200
So Hill took her back to the studio.

1066
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,880
But he's a harmless guy, Boss.

1067
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,880
Don’t need to worry about Jeans.

1068
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,440
I’m not worried about Jeans.

1069
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,160
I’m worried about him.

1070
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,320
Huh?

1071
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,400
Wait—

1072
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:43,880
What?

1073
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,280
You're worried about Hill?

1074
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,400
What?

1075
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:47,760
Is he?

1076
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,000
Never mind. Let's enjoy this.

1077
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Come on, keep dancing!

1078
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,400
I waited for a long time.

1079
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,720
In the end,

1080
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,680
you couldn’t lie to your feelings, right?

1081
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,120
Hill never had feelings for Jeans.

1082
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,560
He was just excited because
Yuka-chan's modeled after me.

1083
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,280
But he never crossed any lines.

1084
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,200
He saw me

1085
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,880
as a colleague he respected, that’s all.

1086
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,000
And all the texts he kept sending me

1087
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,880
were all just to get my advice

1088
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,720
on how to get closer to you, Junji.

1089
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,200
Look at this.

1090
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,080
Isn't he cute?

1091
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,200
This young new employee.

1092
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,560
All he talks about is you, Junji.

1093
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,320
And will you let this opportunity go?

1094
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,280
I don’t want to see you all alone, Junji.

1095
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,800
There's more to life than work, you know.

1096
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,800
Don't wait for the walls to crumble.

1097
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,200
You have to

1098
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,520
break them yourself.

1099
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,560
Now that’s the shot.

1100
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,120
Looks cool.

1101
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,600
This…

1102
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:27,920
Boss.

1103
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
What are you doing?

1104
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,160
Moments like this is the cutest.

1105
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,240
For Mission Three:

1106
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,560
You have to

1107
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,400
ask him to be your boyfriend.

1108
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,480
Just seeing you happy

1109
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,200
makes me happy.

1110
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,120
If I had to take the person I love

1111
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,080
somewhere that's super romantic,

1112
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,400
this would be the place.

1113
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,000
I…

1114
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,280
I…

1115
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,200
I want to…

1116
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,280
I want to—
