1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,640
Junji Fever's going viral.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,920
With #savejunji trending in Thailand.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Because of Yuka’s buzz,
Japan wants us to speed up the launch.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,280
Bay.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,120
Pim.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,040
Phat

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,520
Phat!

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,040
And what about

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,040
when you said there'll be no secrets?

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,440
You’d better leave.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,040
Dad, Mom!

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,400
Actually, Junji and I are…

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,400
Who you date, who you love,

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,640
that’s for you to choose.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
Forget the past.
Let’s make new memories together.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,000
Junji: Good Night!

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,000
Hill: Hope the launch event
goes well tomorrow.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Hill: Ganbatte ne!

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,880
Hill: It’s a mini heart.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Junji: Meaning?

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
Hill: Love.

22
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,800
Junji: Better sleep now. Goodnight.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Hill: Got it. Love you. Boss.

24
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,200
Hill.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,520
Wake up.

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
It's time to wake up.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
You’re late.

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Ganbatte ne! (You got this!)

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,600
It's time to wake up, Hill.

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,760
You’re late.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm awake.

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,000
Hill.

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,320
You’re late.

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Don’t forget your stuff, Hill.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Wait a second.

36
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,000
Today's the launch event.
Is Bay really not coming?

37
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
He must be fed up with you.

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
Always bossing people around.

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm bossy?

40
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,120
Listen to yourself.

41
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,720
What you just said describes you perfectly.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
Me?

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,640
No way.

44
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,120
Everyone's working voluntarily.

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
Yeah, right.

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,560
What don't you ask me?

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm unwilling to work with you.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
I'm unwilling to work with you.

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,360
You think I care?

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
You should. I'm a team leader.

51
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,400
Hey, you two.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Can’t you stop arguing on our launch day?

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,440
Look at you two.

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,160
At least you’re united on this.

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,480
Seriously, it’s almost time.

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,200
Boss hasn’t arrived yet.

58
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,560
And neither has Mr. Phat.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,080
Hill isn’t here.

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,800
You’re the secretary.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Go check on him.

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
I tried, Boss didn't pick up my call.

63
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,960
See? You don’t even know where he is.

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,000
What a competent secretary.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,720
Huh.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
I'm a stellar employee…

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,080
- …for three years.
- But where is he?

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,400
Boss!

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Hello, boss.

70
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Hello, boss.

71
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Is everything okay, Mr. Phat?

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
Yeah, I’m ready.

73
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,360
Great.

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,520
And you, Boss? It’s almost time.

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
Well…

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,120
Can we use his presentation file instead?

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Of course.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
We'll set it up during
the opening ceremony,

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,640
We'll set it up during
the opening ceremony,

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,320
while the MC is on the stage.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,240
Good.

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Hey.

83
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
I think Boss and Mr. Phat

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,800
are nervous

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
and anxious.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
Shall we cheer them on?

87
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,520
Good idea.

88
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,800
I’ll count one, two, three.

89
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,800
Just like we rehearsed.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Here we go.

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Ready?

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,120
Go for it.

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
One, two, three!

94
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,520
Junji-san…

95
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,480
I made it.

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,760
Junji.

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
This?

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,960
An omamori.

99
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,320
I've never made one,
so it's not very pretty.

100
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Thanks.

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
It's cute.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
You got this!

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,120
That’s encouraging.

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,640
They're so cute.

105
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,080
I agree.

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,000
It’s okay, Phat. Bay will show up.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
It’s okay, Phat. Bay will show up.

108
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
- Everyone, let's do it.
- Alright.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,120
One, two, three.

110
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,080
Let's go, Junji-san and Phat! Ganbatte ne!

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,640
- Fighting!
- Yeah!

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,200
Alright, everyone, the moment we’ve been waiting for has finally arrived!

Hill, you better hurry up!

116
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,800
Are we good?

117
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,480
Let’s countdown together

118
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,360
for the video game launch everyone’s waiting for.

119
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Five,

120
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,000
Four,

121
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,000
Three,

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,040
Two,

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
One!

[fans cheering]

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
We made it.

126
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Nice work.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
- Good job.
- Awesome, man.

128
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,480
That's great.

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,920
Make some noise.

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,200
[applause]

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,720
Woohoo!

[fans cheering]

134
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
That was so close.

135
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,200
My dear Hill did a great job.

[fans cheering]

137
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,000
And this is "ETERNAL Kizuna."

Let's give them a big cheer!

139
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,000

That concludes our launch video.

143
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm sure this game will take
everyone to a new dimension.

144
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,640
Are you lonely? Sad? In need of a company?

145
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,760
You can download "ETERNAL Kizuna" now!

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,480
It’s time to meet Mike and Dylon.

Junji and Phat. A round of applause!

- Yeah!
- Woohoo!

149
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,040
Oh yeah!

150
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
Wow!

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
Woohoo!

Yeah!

154

Thank you for joining us.

155
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,400
I’m Junji and Mike is modeled after me.

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was chosen by the team.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
I was chosen by the team.

158
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,560
This is Chef Phat.
Dylon is modeled after him.

159
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,720
He's a beloved chef

160
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
with kindness and culinary skill.

161
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,000
Please welcome him as well.

[fans cheering]

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,280
This game was made for everyone

164
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,000
as a sanctuary from the chaotic reality.

165
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,400
Our characters will surely heal your heart.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,600
Woo!

167
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Woohoo!

168
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,600
Wow!

169
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,960
So…

170
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,480
The team’s dedication to data collection

171
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,800
make the game more realistic and natural.

172
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,800
We’re using the Heal System AI,

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
an intelligent system that allows AI

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,960
an intelligent system that allows AI

175
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,880
to understand emotions and
develop the feeling of love.

176
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,160
Just like "Yuka! Love Me Please."

177
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,160
this is also integrated into the game.

178
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,400
Thank you all for your support.

179
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
We hope you'll enjoy it.

180
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,000
We made it so

181
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,600
players can have fun together.

let's invite Mr. Junji to officially launch

00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
It’s now available for download!

192
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
Thank you, everyone.

193
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,280
- Ah, yes.

194
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,080
Everyone,

195
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,720
this is the moment.

196
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
All the hard work we’ve put in.

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
It's unbelievably

198
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,880
rewarding.

199
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Totally.

200
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,920
I still remember my first day at work.

201
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
It feels like only yesterday.

202
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,400
It's because everyone gave their all.

203
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,880
Too bad Bay isn’t here.

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,960
That guy? If he wants to, he'll come.

205
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,000
He's a moody one.

206
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,760
Honestly, as your senior,

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,080
I thank you for joining us on this journey.

208
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,880
You can be cute sometimes, Pao.

209
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,480
Hey, careful!

210
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,800
I might ship you two.

211
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,000
- The ship has sailed.
- Right?

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,880
- The ship has sailed.
- Right?

213
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
Ship? Us?

214
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
I'd kiss her just to shut you up.

215
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,080
No!

216
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
You idiot!

217
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Gosh.

218
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
This ship has sunk, okay?

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,280
Ouch.

220
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm shipping real hard.

221
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,200
- Me too, man.
- Yeah!

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Please, just stop.

223
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Look at what you did.

224
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
That was a killer slap.

225
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,840
Just a moment.

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,440
Sorry about that.

227
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,160
Bay.

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,560
Bay, wait up.

229
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,920
My name's Bob, not Bay.

230
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Oh.

231
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,000
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,560
Sorry, I got the wrong person.

233
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,880
It’s fine, but can I have a photo with you?

234
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,200
Both of you.

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Sure.

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
One, two…

237
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
Thank you.

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,080
You okay, Phat?

239
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
I’m scared.

240
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,000
Afraid he'll leave me
like he did with the others.

241
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,040
You know Bay wouldn’t do that.

242
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,520
But he disappeared and now

243
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
I’m not so sure anymore

244
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,400
Trust me, he'll come back.

245
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,880
[sighs]

246
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,160
Let’s go back in.

247
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
There are people are waiting for us.

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Let’s spread some positivity.

249
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Cheers.

250
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
Yeah!

251
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Wow.

252
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,200
Alright.

253
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,800
We’re switching things up
by celebrate here today.

254
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Because Sales team has
an announcement to make.

255
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,160
Hey, now.

256
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,720
Do it quickly, bro. I want to sing karaoke.

257
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Go ahead.

258
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,920
Sorry, Pao, but ladies first.

259
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,400
I’m going first.

260
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Don’t fight.

261
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,600
So, after the launch just now,

262
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,720
our game’s download count

263
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,200
is now number one in the country.

264
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
- Yeah!
- Woohoo!

265
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,720
Amazing.

266
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,000
And that’s not all. Look at the logins.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There are hundreds of
thousands of active users.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Breaking our previous record

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,400
Breaking our previous record

270
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,120
made by “Yuka! Love Me Please.”

271
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,800
Heck yeah!

272
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,000
What are you waiting for?

273
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
Boss said drinks are on him.

274
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Everyone, bottoms up.

275
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,360
Woohoo!

276
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,120
Whoa.

277
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,840
That’s not all.

278
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,880
There’s a special surprise from our boss.

279
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey!

280
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,720
Really?

281
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,000
What is it?

282
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,600
Junji-san has a surprise too?

283
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,800
- Oh, damn!
- Interesting.

284
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
- Tonight…
- Yes?

285
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,560
whoever sings best

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,480
will win 5,000 baht.

287
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,240
Damn.

288
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,200
- 5,000?
- 5,000 baht!

289
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,800
Yes.

290
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm getting serious.

291
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,520
Come on.

292
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,040
Alright.

293
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,680
That's right.

294
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,320
Let's go.

295
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,960
Boom will be the judge on behalf of Boss.

296
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,120
Wait. Why me?

297
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
Aren’t you supposed to be the judge?

298
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,600
No, I resigned as a judge.

299
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,680
Because the title of Jukebox Queen
isn’t easy to get.

300
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,800
This year's top contender

301
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,120
is me.

302
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,600
[sighs]

303
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,000
Jukebox Queen vs. Karaoke King.

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,040
Jukebox Queen vs. Karaoke King.

305
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,440
You think you're good. But last year,

306
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,760
someone's talent snatched all the votes.

307
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,880
That person was none other than…

308
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Who?

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,720
This hot and loaded man right here!

310
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Give me the mic, I'll go first.

311
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,760
- The mic.
- I’ll sing.

312
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
- Hey, let me.
- I'm warming up.

313
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
[practice singing]

314
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
How's that?

315
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,640
Oh, just stop, I beg you.

316
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
- Just let me sing.
- No, I'm singing.

317
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
Give me the mic, please.

318
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,120
Let me sing first.

319
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,560
I’m gonna swing…

320
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,680
Enough, my ears.

321
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,600
…from the chandelier…

322
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,000
- …wiggle, wiggle back and forth.
- This is one hell of a ship.

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
PRISMSTAR HQ : Hi.

324
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,000
PRISMSTAR HQ : Need to talk, you free?

325
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,440
(Junji : Of course, sir.)
- Look, this side still red.

326
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,680
Want another slap?

327
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,400
Everyone.

328
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,680
Have fun, guys.

329
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,800
I’ll step outside for a bit.

330
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,120
Ah.

331
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,960
Got it.

332
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,320
I'm going with you.
My ears might hurt if I stay.

333
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
How dare you, Hill.

334
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,000
- Just kidding.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,160
- Just kidding.
- Yeah.

336
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,800
I'll be back.

337
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,480
Soon.

338
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,400
Is he mocking us?

339
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,840
- Of course he is.
- No!

340
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,000
- Hill!
- So dramatic.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,280
He's going to pay for this.

342
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Which song?

343
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
“Chandelier,” I haven’t finished.

344
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,400
Which song?

345
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,360
Hello, testing.

346
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,440
[practice singing]

347
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Go sing outside.

348
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,600
Trust me, let me go first.

349
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,400
- No, I’ll sing.
- These two again.

350
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
- Why?
- Trust me.

351
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,600
- Can't you wait?
- No, let me sing first.

352
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,920
I want in.

353
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,880
Well…

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,040
- Oh…
- Of course.

355
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,920
Sure, go ahead.

356
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
- Here.
- All yours.

357
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
Let's go. Move it.

358
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,880
[applause]

359
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
Go for it, Mr. Phat.

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,800
Yeah.

361
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,920
I still think of you on lonely days.

362
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,000
It's morning but it's feels too late.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
It's morning but it's feels too late.

364
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,120
I want to tell you everything and anything.

365
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Oh, my mind keeps wandering back to you.

366
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,400
I want to stargaze tonight, just us two.

367
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm asking the moon and stars to tell you.

368
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,440
Think of us, of everything and anything.

369
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh, know that you're always on my mind…

370
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,080
Junji.

371
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Yeah?

372
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,560
I haven’t congratulated you.

373
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Congratulations.

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The game we poured our hearts into

375
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
has succeeded beyond our expectations.

376
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,720
It’s all thanks to you, Junji,

377
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,080
for choosing Yuka-chan’s Heal System AI

378
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,840
and use it in the new game.

379
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,960
I believe it will make tons of people

380
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,680
fall in love with it and download the game.

381
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,160
I didn't do it,

382
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,600
it's you and everyone’s dedication.

383
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,440
Without you all, we wouldn’t be here.

384
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,880
I still remember that day at your room.

385
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, I see.

386
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,600
"I’ll help you, Boss!"

387
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,400
Junji, you have great memory.

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,280
But, did I ever do something like that?

389
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,320
Well,

390
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,800
you’ve done so much for me.

391
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,440
Thank you.

392
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,320
- Don’t worry.
- What?

393
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,720
I'll always take care of you, Boss.

394
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,520
[laughs]

395
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,040
The game has just begun.

396
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,920
This is the real test. Will it last?

397
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,800
About this matter,

398
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
you don't need to worry.

399
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Right now,

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
you're going viral.

401
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,800
Everyone’s talking about you.

402
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,520
They are paying attention
to things other than the game.

403
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,520
After the press conference,

404
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,440
your popularity has skyrocketed.

405
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,680
Look at this.

406
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,000
The followers count of Mike's page.

407
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,000
It went up from 100,000 to 350,000.

408
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,280
It went up from 100,000 to 350,000.

409
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,600
I see.

410
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,240
I believe this game will succeed.

411
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,320
After the event, I’ve been
more fired up than ever.

412
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,160
I promise,

413
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,600
I’ll devote everything to this game.

414
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,600
For you, Junji.

415
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,200
We will, together.

416
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes.

417
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Ah, sorry.

418
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,200
Then I’ll head back first.

419
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

420
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,400
Alright.

421
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,440
Hello.

422
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,320
Hello.

423
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,120
Congratulations on your achievement.

424
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,600
The game you just released is amazing work.

425
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Thank you.

426
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,000
It’s my duty, after all.

427
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,480
Thank you for your hard work.

428
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,720
Since we couldn't do this in person,

429
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,600
I’d like to offer my congratulations
hrough the screen.

430
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,400
I'd like to give you good news as a reward.

431
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,640
The executive wants to reward
this success by promoting you

432
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,600
and have you lead a major project in Japan.

433
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
Thank you very much.

434
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,440
So I want to ask you,

435
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
when could you return to work in Japan?

436
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,600
What’s wrong?

437
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,320
Isn’t this your dream?

438
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,040
You went to Thailand to prove yourself.

439
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,960
Wasn’t it for this position?

440
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
Please inform me when you're
ready to start work in Japan.

441
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,120
Please inform me when you're
ready to start work in Japan.

442
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,920
Don’t worry about Thailand.

443
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,480
I’ll send Koeda to take care of things.

444
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,640
You can be assured that
everything will run smoothly.

445
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Yes.

446
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,880
Understood.

447
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
Goodbye.

448
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,680
…Everyday, until now.

449
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,720
I forgot the lyrics.

450
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,600
Things keep moving forward.

451
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
- What must I do from now on?
- What must I do from now?

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
Oh, no. The key. The lyrics.

453
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,240
Endless flow of tears.

454
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,000
Tears… Tears…

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Tears… Tears…

456
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,320
- From a heart full of love.
- Hey, Phat.

457
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,280
They're off-key, how can you stand it?

458
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,040
- No one’s wrong, and Bay isn’t wrong.
- …Blame the sea, the moon, and the stars.

459
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,120
What's that?

460
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,880
Your bro.

461
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,280
Hope he disappears for good.

462
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,720
Calm down, Phat.

463
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,480
No one can contact him right now.

464
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,720
But I think he’ll return eventually.

465
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,600
…Sky is a witness

466
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,400
to my tears…

467
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,960
Someone from above, tell me.

468
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
Are we not meant to be?

469
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,080
Are we not meant to be?

470
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,440
How we have hurt.

471
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,680
Wow, dude.

472
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,560
How we have hurt…

473
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,040
…each other?

474
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
No… Oh…

475
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,640
[sighs]

476
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,360
[singing]

477
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
I haven’t told you the good news yet.

478
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,200
Oh?

479
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
What news, Junji?

480
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,800
"Yuka! Love Me Please" is now yours.

481
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,680
I entrust you to take care of it.

482
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,200
You can decide how to proceed next.

483
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,720
Wait.

484
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
- Really, Junji?
- Really.

485
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,000
A reward

486
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,680
for your hard work.

487
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:11,000
From now on, please take care of it
as well as the ones we’ve created.

488
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,600
Understood, Boss.

489
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,800
Osu!

490
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,760
Ganbatte ne. (You got this.)

491
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,600
Someone from above, tell me.

492
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Are we not meant to be? Oh… Oh…

493
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,240
Why do you have to hurt me so?

494
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,120
Leave behind the memories of us.

495
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,000
Forget it all.

496
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,880
How we have hurt.

497
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,000
How we have hurt…

498
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,880
How we have hurt…

499
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,800
…each other?

500
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:16,560
No… Oh… No… Oh… Oh…

501
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,320
Mind if I join in?

502
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,600
Baby brother.

503
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,960
You drink like one glass a year.

504
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,080
You sure?

505
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Yeah.

506
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,480
You seem down today.

507
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,320
It's my duty as your sister

508
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,880
to drink with you.

509
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,000
Bay left me.

510
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,600
It was so sudden.

511
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,400
So, all men are just like Mom said.

512
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,400
You’re just waiting for him to come back?

513
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
But, isn't he also waiting for you?

514
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,480
Was I really wrong that day?

515
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,720
He lied

516
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,400
and just disappeared.

517
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,800
That's it?

518
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
Is this what true love is like?

519
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Some times,

520
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,480
no one’s really right or wrong.

521
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,800
We always believe we're right.

522
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,600
Don't you think Bay did it
to help Mom and Dad?

523
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,720
Look at our parents as an example.

524
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,840
She forgave him. And now, just look at her.

525
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,160
She’s happy again.

526
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,800
She doesn’t know,

527
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,160
if in the future,

528
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,800
Dad might leave again.

529
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,720
But forgiveness

530
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,720
brings back her happiness.

531
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Don't you think?

532
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,320
Yeah, I think so.

533
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,640
You could try to do
the same and forgive Bay.

534
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,080
So you can be happy too.

535
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,080
Oh wow.

536
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,120
One more of this, please.

537
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
Sorry.

538
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,400
We're closing up.

539
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,080
Mr. Phat closing early?

540
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,360
Impossible.

541
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,880
Well, not anymore.

542
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,120
I put it on the usual tab

543
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,400
and we'll settle it later.

544
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,760
Sure.

545
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,720
So where are you rushing off to?

546
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,920
Got an important matter to deal with.

547
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,720
It’s about Bay. I never guess wrong.

548
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,160
Totally.

549
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:44,280
Some fans wants a fan meeting with Dylon.

550
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Are you okay with this?

551
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,680
If not, just say so.

552
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,080
Yeah, no problem.

553
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,600
But I have one request.

554
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,960
Oh, do tell me.

555
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,000
When you head back,

556
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,800
help me lock up this place.

557
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,400
We already sent all the staffs home.

558
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Ah, right.

559
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,960
Okay, go ahead.

560
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,520
Thanks.

561
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,800
Later, guys.

562
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
My, my!

563
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,960
How could you leave a VIP customer like me?

564
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
VIP? You wish.

565
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,400
Boss is paying, not you.

566
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,320
You never cover the bill.

567
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,080
You never paid last month's.

568
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,880
Boss,

569
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
this meal…

570
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Oh.

571
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,280
Could you take care of it? Thank you.

572
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,120
Me? This one's on me?

573
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,440
You’re the secretary.

574
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Put it on his tab first.

575
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,400
Settle the last bill first.

576
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,720
Please, it’s the end of the month.

577
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,200
Help me out.

578
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,600
I was joking.

579
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,920
Yes! Thank you, Boss.

580
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,000
You're the life saver. Thank you.

581
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
You're the life saver. Thank you.

582
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,080
You're so kind.

583
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,560
[sighs]

584
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,120
Such nice weather.

585
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,960
Thanks for showing me around.

586
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,720
Next date will be even nicer.

587
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,000
I promise you’ll love it.

588
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,000
Thanks for showing me these nice places.

589
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,320
Hill.

590
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,640
Hill. Wake up.

591
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,240
Hill.

592
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,320
You’re late, Wake up!

593
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,480
You’re late, Hill. Wake up!

594
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,000
It’s seven o’clock. Time to get up.

595
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,480
Actually, today is my day off, Yuka.

596
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
I forgot to turn it off.

597
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Oh, you're awake?

598
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,480
I am.

599
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,600
Do you need my help, Hill?

600
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,800
Actually,

601
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,480
I need to ask you something.

602
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,200
You can ask me anything, I’ll answer.

603
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,360
Yuka.

604
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,960
Do you ever feel lonely, Yuka?

605
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,080
Well.

606
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,680
With you here, I never feel lonely.

607
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,400
What if one day,

608
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,000
I stopped talking to you?

609
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,800
I’ll still be here.
You'll see me whenever you log in.

610
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,200
Of course.

611
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,960
That's to be expected.

612
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,400
My duty is to be your friend.

613
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,880
If one day you stop talking to me,

614
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,880
it means you've made friends.

615
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,080
And that’s a good thing, isn’t it?

616
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
But if that happens,

617
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,120
I would be a selfish person

618
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,520
who left Yuka all alone.

619
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,120
But I've got an idea, Yuka.

620
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,920
Something good?

621
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Yeah. We’ll talk later, Yuka.

622
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,880
I’ve got to go.

623
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,360
Nice talking to you, Hill.

624
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,280
Junji.

625
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,720
Do you need something?

626
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,560
I…

627
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,080
I want you to help me with something.

628
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,600
Is it something scary?

629
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,040
Come on.

630
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,720
Have I ever asked you
to do something scary?

631
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,840
Many times.

632
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,400
Like riding a motorcycle in Ratchaburi

633
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
or eating burnt pork skewer.

634
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,800
See?

635
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,240
Okay, I get it.

636
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,000
But this time it won’t be scary at all.

637
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,080
But this time it won’t be scary at all.

638
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,880
So what do you want me to do?

639
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,080
Help me for the next two days.

640
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,280
I want you to try to win me over.

641
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,120
I'm doing something for Yuka-chan.

642
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,280
What are you doing?

643
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,200
I’ll create a new character,
modeled after me, named Haruki.

644
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Really?

645
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,600
Why are you doing this?

646
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,640
To say goodbye to Yuka, one last time.

647
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,440
When the game shuts down,
this character we created,

648
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,080
he’ll stay by Yuka’s side forever.

649
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,800
Yuka-chan is Junji,

650
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,680
and Haruki is me.

651
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,720
So romantic.

652
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,920
For this date

653
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,360
let me handle it.

654
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,400
- Sure.
- Good.

655
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,000
I’m curious where you’ll take me.

656
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,920
You enjoy this kind of activity, Junji?

657
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,720
Yeah.

658
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,200
But I rarely had the chance to do it.

659
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,200
It's my first time doing this.

660
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,760
What about you?

661
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,160
Me?

662
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,280
It’s also my first time kayaking.

663
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,400
Don’t worry, Junji.

664
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You can call me Captain Hill.

665
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,400
Can I trust you?

666
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,200
Of course, you can.

667
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,520
You know me.

668
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,760
What’s so funny?

669
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,280
Look at Captain Hill.

670
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
You're wearing it wrong. Will you be okay?

671
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,800
Fixed.

672
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,400
Oh, no.

673
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,320
Crap.

674
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,440
Don’t worry, Junji.
Captain Hill will get it for you.

675
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,160
Stay put, alright?

676
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,760
Actually…

677
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,720
- Wait a second.
- Huh?

678
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,360
Wrong direction.

679
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
It’s Captain Hill’s plan.

680
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,320
You don’t understand.

681
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,320
[sighs]

682
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,120
Looks like we'll sink first.

683
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,360
That's not true, Junji.

684
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,680
Trust me.

685
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,920
Oops.

686
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,600
Ouch.

687
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,720
[exclaims in fear]

688
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,840
Okay.

689
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,800
See? Captain Hill got it.

690
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,760
In the end, I got the hat back for you.

691
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,400
You managed to get it
with the paddle. Thanks.

692
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,400
Are you teasing me?

693
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,800
No, that’s praise.

694
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Really?

695
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
Look me in the eyes.

696
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,800
They say you can’t lie if we do this.

697
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,520
It's really a praise.

698
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,320
Okay, I believe you.

699
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,960
That wasn't very cool,

700
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,480
but

701
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,000
still adorable.

702
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,920
What did you bring for camping?

703
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,600
Do we need anything else besides the tent?

704
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,600
I knew it. You didn’t prepare much.

705
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,400
[sighs]

706
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,360
Here.

707
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,320
The sun’s strong here,
so you need sunglasses.

708
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,200
Let me.

709
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,320
Good.

710
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,760
Wear them, even when I'm not around.

711
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,520
Got it, Junji.

712
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,040
And…

713
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,800
Here.

714
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,080
Sunscreen.

715
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,200
Arms.

716
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,720
You must put it on when out in the sun.

717
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,520
Make sure you use it.

718
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,880
Okay.

719
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,320
What if I don’t know how to put it on?

720
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,200
Then I'll be in trouble.

721
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,800
Huh?

722
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Wait a second.

723
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,840
Junji, where did you learn lines like this?

724
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,200
Hold on.

725
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,760
I forgot I have something prepared as well.

726
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,720
Here.

727
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,160
There you go.

728
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,720
Nice!

729
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,400
A bit small, but it's cute.

730
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,000
Huh?

731
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,800
What?

732
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,360
Really?

733
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,360
This thing

734
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,200
looks like you.

735
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,840
Really? I don't think so.

736
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,400
Look.

737
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
I bought it because the duck

738
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,400
looks like you. See?

739
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,000
You like to make a serious face like this.

740
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,160
You like to make a serious face like this.

741
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,920
But you look different now.

742
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,080
You're smiling.

743
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,080
Not funny.

744
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,920
You look so different now. Look.

745
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,720
That's enough.

746
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,960
- Take a look.
- Stop it.

747
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
- Let’s set up the tent.
- Fine.

748
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,520
I bet I can do this with my eyes closed.

749
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,360
Hill.

750
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,000
Should we get some help?

751
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,280
Should we get some help?

752
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,600
No need, Junji.

753
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,200
Trust me, I can do it this.

754
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,080
I'll be done soon.

755
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,560
It's been hours.

756
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,920
There's food to cook as well.

757
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,560
Just a bit longer, Junji.

758
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Are you making the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

759
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,200
Wait a little longer. I’ll make it work.

760
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,600
[grunts]

761
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,000
[heavy breathing]

762
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,600
[heavy breathing]

763
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,960
It's good enough for sleeping.

764
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,280
No.

765
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,680
No way.

766
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,800
Just a bit more.

767
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,080
I’ll set up the tent for you, Junji.

768
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,320
In a minute.

769
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,680
You’re really giving it your all.

770
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,560
Here, this one.

771
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,680
This one.

772
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,680
Right here.

773
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

774
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,240
[sighs]

775
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,040
Guess we’re not suited for camping, Junji.

776
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,960
I should have trusted you.

777
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,160
We should have asked for help,

778
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,080
it would’ve been done by now.

779
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,680
It's fun, doing something crazy with you.

780
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,720
I had fun.

781
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,000
Right.

782
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,120
You're having fun, but I’m so exhausted.

783
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,600
[sighs]

784
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,840
But next time,

785
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,800
I know I can set up the tent properly.

786
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,440
Sure, next time will be better.

787
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,200
You set up the tent and
I’ll handle the cooking.

788
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,680
Sure.

789
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,000
[in Japanese] I’m full.

790
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
What did you say?

791
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,280
Oh, I’m full.

792
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
- You're full?
- Yep.

793
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,600
You would be.

794
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,200
You ate so much.

795
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,400
It was delicious.

796
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,000
Well,

797
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,600
you look messy.

798
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,960
I made a mess?

799
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,960
On my face?

800
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:05,960
Where?

801
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,320
Not there.

802
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,360
On the left.

803
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,520
- Left.
- Yeah.

804
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,560
Did it come off?

805
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,560
Did it come off, Junji?

806
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,120
Looks like it won’t come off.

807
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,200
Damn.

808
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,200
What do we do?

809
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,480
What?

810
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,120
Hey, why are you taking a picture?

811
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,800
Here, a selfie.

812
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,680
One, two, three.

813
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,560
Looks good.

814
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,760
This?

815
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,520
- Let's go shower.
- My face.

816
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,000
A shower.

817
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,920
- Why?
- Yeah.

818
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,760
Just wipe it off.

819
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,680
Let's take a shower.

820
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,000
- Damn.
- Together.

821
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,200
Fine, I'm going.

822
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,880
- Can we leave it here?
- Yeah.

823
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,800
You know what, Junji?

824
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,200
Everything might've been a bit messy today,

825
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,960
but I’m incredibly happy.

826
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,320
For me,

827
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,560
I'm the happiest when I'm with you.

828
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,200
Next time,

829
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,000
let’s make an even bigger mess.

830
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,080
let’s make an even bigger mess.

831
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,800
Sure! Especially the tent you set up.

832
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,600
That.

833
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,160
It's not perfect, but it’s perfect for us.

834
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,280
What do you mean, Junji?

835
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:32,080
At least the tent is full of laughter.

836
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,560
And your cooking is amazing.

837
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,920
Now we have such beautiful view of stars.

838
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,160
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

839
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,400
Let’s take a picture.

840
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,000
Stay where you are.

841
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,560
Stay where you are.

842
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,320
Okay, ten seconds.

843
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,880
What is "star" in Japanese?

844
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,320
- Hoshi.
- Hoshi.

845
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,280
Hoshi.

846
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,760
- That one.
- Yeah?

847
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,720
The North Star.

848
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,600
We call it the North Star.

849
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,400
North Star.

850
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,520
Yup, North Star.

851
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,600
That's Orion's Belt.

852
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,480
- Yeah.
- Orion's Belt.

853
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,760
You got mosquito bites?

854
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,280
Yeah.

855
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,600
- Let’s go.
- Huh?

856
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,600
Let's go inside.

857
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,800
Okay.

858
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,760
Here, come.

859
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,200
Sit.

860
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,760
Hill.

861
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,120
Hill.

862
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,560
I have something to tell you.

863
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:55,280
Headquarters in Japan asked
me to return for their big project.

864
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,080
This was your dream, right?

865
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,680
It used to be, yes.

866
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,560
But…

867
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,200
Not anymore.

868
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,200
My dream now is to stay in Thailand.

869
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,960
Making games with you.

870
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,800
Thank you, Junji.

871
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,960
For choosing to stay here.

872
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,160
But,

873
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,600
do you remember?

874
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,760
You and Yuka

875
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,040
were the ones who told me

876
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,880
not to give up on my dreams.

877
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,800
And we met because I was chasing my dream.

878
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,040
Right now,

879
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:35,000
I want you to follow your dream.

880
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,880
It's fine. No matter where
you are, whatever you do,

881
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,120
one day,

882
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,560
I’ll make my way to see you.

883
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,160
Thank you.

884
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,400
For everything, Hill.

885
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,000
Thanks for always being my comfort zone.

886
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,280
Hello.

887
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,200
Just my signature?

888
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,600
- You look great!
- Oh, thanks.

889
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,520
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

890
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,560
Thank you.

891
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,440
Thanks, see you next time!

892
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,440
Everyone looks so happy!

893
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,680
Could you come to the front, please?

894
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,160
Yay!

895
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:42,400
[fans clapping and cheering]

896
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,520
Woohoo!

897
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,400
Is there anything
you’d like to say to your fans?

898
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,000
I just want to thank everyone.

899
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,720
Honestly, it’s not just
me spreading positivity.

900
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,000
From the game’s launch to this fan meeting,

901
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,320
From the game’s launch to this fan meeting,

902
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,200
it’s all of you who are
sending me positivity.

903
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,760
Thank you all so much.

904
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:13,200
[fans cheering]

905
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,880
[applause]

906
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,600
Amazing, our game is so popular!

907
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,880
Mr. Phat, is there a secret
or a behind-the-scene story

908
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,400
that you can share?

909
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,400
It's about love.

910
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,800
Oh!

911
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,960
I fell in love with one of the team
members who created the game.

912
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,560
We simulated dates and
ended up falling in love.

913
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,520
Aw!

914
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,000
A secret that shocked everyone in the hall!

915
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,680
But now, they're gone.

916
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,000
It’s because I kept blaming them

917
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,800
It’s because I kept blaming them

918
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
when it could've been my fault.

919
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,800
Bay, if you’re listening,

920
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,760
I want to tell you

921
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,800
I’m sorry.

922
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,400
I’m sorry too.

923
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,880
I’m sorry too.

924
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,960
It’s okay.

925
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:19,040
[fans cheering and screaming]

926
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,600
I’m sorry for disappearing.

927
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,120
I thought you were angry and hated me.

928
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,200
Phat,

929
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,200
not a day went by that
I didn’t think about you.

930
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,040
Now I know how important you are to me.

931
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,800
I love you.

932
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,560
And I will never leave you.

933
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:23,760
[fans cheering and screaming]

934
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,560
Take care of yourself while I’m gone.

935
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,320
