1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,240
Junji-san,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,440
will you be my boyfriend?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,560
It’s impossible

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,520
between me

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,760
and Junji-san.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,760
Why do you feel guilty about Yuka?

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,560
I mean, Yuka and Junji

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,600
are the same person.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,080
Why does he

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,560
have to lie to everyone?

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,560
Let’s go back to how we were.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,160
Now I know how I truly feel.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,280
Give me one more chance, Junji.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Don't!

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,200
Please, let me prove it to you.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,280
Just this once, Junji.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,560
Letting me back was the right call.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,280
I'm confident

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
I can make this game better than the last.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Because I’m the only one

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,560
who knows you best, Junji.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,360
Even about…

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,560
I won't give up.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,640
Not on the game,

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,200
and not on Junji-san.

26
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Alright.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
We'll see.

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,720
Good news today, everyone.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,080
Our new game

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,160
has a sponsor now.

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Wow.

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,320
The game’s not even done,

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,920
and you managed to sell it?

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Good job, newbie!

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
Yeah.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,160
Of course.

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,000
Gen Z is built for speed.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Gen Z is built for speed.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,960
So this means

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,160
we Gen Y folks

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,120
have more work now?

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,040
Well…

43
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,840
That's a yes.

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
But I think it’s worth the effort.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,040
Take a look.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,760
White Memories Hotel,

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,120
our major sponsor,

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,840
wants there to be a hotel scene

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,560
in the game.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Hang on.

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,120
Boss,

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,040
don't tell me…

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,960
Stats for Otome game (male dating sim)

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
show that

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,920
the most popular date
location among players

56
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,240
is the beach.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,080
I agree with you.

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,520
You're the best, Boss.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
Hey. We're in a meeting.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,400
But…

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
Think of something and pitch it to me.

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,040
I want everyone

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,560
to scout for

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,320
the spot

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,320
for the game’s ending scene.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,880
Okay.

67
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,160
But that’s the hardest part.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,520
We'll have to please both players

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,040
and the sponsor.

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
If we focus too much on tie-ins,

71
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
it’ll ruin the game’s vibe.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,040
it’ll ruin the game’s vibe.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
In other words,

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
it won’t feel real.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,880
That's true.

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,960
This one’s tough,

77
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
it needs someone with a lot of experience.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,800
According to my research,

79
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,840
or rather, based on what Junji said,

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,400
having dinner

81
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,320
by the beach

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,200
and looking fashionable

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,040
will help players decide more easily.

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
I’ve been studying

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,840
ever since I got this project.

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
Having been with this game since day one,

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,200
I know the players best,

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
I mean, among everyone here.

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,640
Mm.

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
I think I should handle it myself.

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
And as for you…

92
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,440
Focus on the bugs you were assigned to fix.

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,640
Our team

94
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,760
should all work together.

95
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,080
If anyone comes up with an idea,

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,200
bring it up

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,520
on that day.

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,960
Okay.

99
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,440
Isn't this a full-on battle?

100
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,280
So intense.

101
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,320
Right.

102
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
This trip’s gonna be fun for sure.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
Can’t wait to see who wins.

104
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm Team Hill.

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,280
Why are you being so nosy?

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Then,

107
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,520
why are you gossiping?

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,720
Just feeling you out.

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,560
Bay.

110
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,760
Yes?

111
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
Get Phat to come along.

112
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,440
Tell him

113
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
it's for gathering materials.

114
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,240
Alright.

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't know about them

116
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
but I've already won.

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
What nonsense are you saying?

118
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,080
What?

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,720
I was talking

120
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,240
about them.

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,960
Who are you—?

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,520
Well, I have my own battle.

123
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,040
Let me carry that.

124
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,240
Hey, it’s fine.

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
Come on, let me.

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,680
Let me.

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,000
Tomorrow,

128
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,640
you'll come to the office

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,280
and we’ll leave together.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,520
Well…

131
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,840
Please?

132
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
I want to enjoy it with you.

133
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,000
Think of it as gathering materials.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
Think of it as gathering materials.

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,880
Okay?

136
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
Let me think about it.

137
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Is this a celebration?

138
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,200
You’re going all out.

139
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
Oh.

140
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
Nothing, it’s nothing.

141
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,920
But

142
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,920
you’re up late too.

143
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,080
Actually, I was already asleep.

144
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
So,

145
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,000
what’s behind you?

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,320
what’s behind you?

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,240
Ah.

148
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,480
- Nothing.
- Can I see?

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,640
- Can I see?

150
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:03,920
But

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
there's nothing.

152
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,320
Heh.

153
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,920
Oh wow.

154
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
That’s a huge roasted duck.

155
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,120
It's Phat’s favorite.

156
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,000
I think,

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,520
the smell must woke me up.

158
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
I see.

159
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,280
Well,

160
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
want to join us for a meal?

161
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
I was joking.

162
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,040
I just came down for some water.

163
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,360
Alright.

164
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,960
Make yourself at home.

165
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,280
Once you're done eating, it’ll be late.

166
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,960
Why don’t you let him stay over tonight?

167
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
Isn't tomorrow a day off?

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,560
No need.

169
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
He can go home just fine.

170
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,080
I see.

171
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
In that case,

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,320
I’ll take this then.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,440
Okay.

174
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,960
Off to bed.

175
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Good night.

176
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,000
Good night, sis.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,680
Good night, sis.

178
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,400
What is it?

179
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,720
It’s…

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,240
This.

181
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,400
I…

182
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,400
I’ve been reflecting all this time

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,640
that I want to give this love a try.

184
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,680
I’ve never felt like
this for anyone before.

185
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,080
Is it because I’m your first guy?

186
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
It’s not about

187
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,560
your gender at all.

188
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
You're the right person.

189
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,800
And that feeling

190
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
just keeps growing.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,120
And now I

192
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,000
I know that

193
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,480
everything, including that night…

194
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
- I—
- About that night,

195
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
I have no issue with it.

196
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,760
But I think

197
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,080
you shouldn’t rush into acting this way.

198
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,640
Phat.

199
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
I just want us—

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
If you want to keep it casual,

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'd understand.

202
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,280
Maybe

203
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,080
our work

204
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,960
was what caused us

205
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,000
to get carried away in that moment.

206
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
It’s not like that, Phat.

207
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,040
I—

208
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
I think…

209
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,640
Don’t say anything just yet.

210
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,160
Sorry.

211
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,160
It’s just…

212
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,200
I don’t even know

213
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
how I feel myself.

214
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,120
Please don’t pressure me on this.

215
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,800
Okay.

216
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,080
I understand.

217
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,320
I should head back now.

218
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,200
It's getting late.

219
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,240
I forgot we’re leaving early tomorrow.

220
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,000
Still,

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
I really want you

222
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
to come along, Phat.

223
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,880
Hey,

224
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,400
Pao and the Gang,

225
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
aren’t your outfits too casual?

226
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,400
We’re going to work,

227
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
not on vacation.

228
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,960
What the heck?

229
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
Lady.

230
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,760
If you insult me, I can take it,

231
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,080
but you insult my team,
I can’t let that slide.

232
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
What's wrong with this outfit?

233
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,120
We’re going to the beach,

234
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,360
you want us in suits, ties,

235
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,960
slacks, and pointy shoes?

236
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,000
You should follow my example.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,880
A model employee.

238
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
You’re too uptight.

239
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
We're not at the office.

240
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,360
That's true.

241
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,920
Right?

242
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,760
You look so

243
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
out of place.

244
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
Everyone's ready?

245
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,920
Ready!

246
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,960
My team?

247
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,040
That'll be me.

248
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,560
Someone

249
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,520
has to keep you

250
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
from wandering off god knows where.

251
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,560
What the heck.

252
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,840
We’re busted.

253
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,600
She got us good.

254
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,600
Boom, you’re coming too.

255
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,280
And Hill,

256
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,480
You are riding with me.

257
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,840
Me too?

258
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,480
Of course.

259
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,600
So,

260
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,560
What about…

261
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,960
Art? Is he not here?

262
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,440
He'd already left at 3 a.m.

263
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
Said he was checking on the tide,

264
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,920
meteor showers,

265
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,320
and sunrise times.

266
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
He’s serious about this.

267
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,240
Will you be okay?

268
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,560
Really?

269
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Well, damn.

271
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
Art’s really hardworking.

272
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,480
Man.

273
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,880
Can I still join you guys?

274
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
About time you showed up.

275
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,040
Thought you weren’t coming.

276
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,360
Then

277
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,120
ride with me, Phat.

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,720
[teasing noises]

279
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,680
Oh,

280
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,720
Sorry.

281
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,360
We have

282
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
made plans

283
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,480
to ride together.

284
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,360
Boss!

285
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,680
What?

286
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
Alright,

287
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,280
everyone.

288
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,600
Let’s all meet at the hotel

289
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,960
before sunset, got it?

290
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,280
Let's go.

291
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,760
Move it.

292
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Why don’t you ride with Boss?

293
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,600
Drive carefully, okay?

294
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
No speeding, no ticket.

295
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,520
Boom,

296
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,000
load it in the car.

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,320
load it in the car.

298
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,200
- Hill, ride with us.
- Wait, Hill.

299
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,480
Hill, you're with me.

300
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,760
- I'm driving alone.
- Huh?

301
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,640
I'm all alone.

302
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,400
I need company.

303
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
- Take care of him.
- Yeah, yeah.

304
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,880
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

305
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,800
We meet at six!

306
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,160
Why aren’t you helping me lift my bag?

307
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,480
Just give your bag to Boom!

308
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,080
You talk too much.

309
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,680
Thinking about Bay?

310
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,160
You really know me well.

311
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,920
Well, you are my best friend.

312
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
You can tell me anything, you know.

313
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,920
Why?

314
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,520
Don’t you have enough on your mind already?

315
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,720
Especially about Hill.

316
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,840
So you know.

317
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,000
- You are my best friend.
- You are my best friend.

318
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
I’m just confused.

319
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,240
I can’t even explain it right now.

320
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,000
What about you?

321
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,400
Well,

322
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,960
a little bit.

323
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,600
Honestly, it’s nothing.

324
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,880
Right now,

325
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,520
I just want to focus on the game.

326
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,920
It’s about to launch.

327
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,200
Just you wait.

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,120
One day, I’m going to
find out what’s in your heart.

329
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,960
I won’t make it easy for you!

330
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,320
Alright.

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,960
The guys have to pair up.

332
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,280
One room, two people.

333
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,960
Oh man,

334
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,040
please don't pair me up with Pao.

335
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,960
I need to sleep.

336
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
Oh, please.

337
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,120
Like I’m dying to room with you, Boom.

338
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,040
I’ve already picked.

339
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,800
Bay.

340
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,520
You’re with me.

341
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,000
We’ll drink until sunrise.

342
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,240
Love you, man.

343
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,440
But can I not room with you?

344
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,160
You sure are loved, Pao.

345
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,080
[laughing]

346
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,120
That’s a big blow.

347
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,600
I’ve got an idea.

348
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,880
How about a game?

349
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,840
Whoever wins

350
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,240
gets to choose their roommate.

351
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,600
Sure.

352
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,080
Okay.

353
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
Sounds good.

354
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,080
I think that’s a good idea.

355
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,520
When it comes to games,

356
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,800
I rarely lose.

357
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,040
Oh…

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
That's good but

359
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
aren't you too confident?

360
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
No one can win every time.

361
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,160
Well,

362
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,040
if you lose, you’d better accept it.

363
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,080
So what game should we play?

364
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,520
The newspaper stepping game.

365
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,880
The rules are simple.

366
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,440
Pair up and stand together on
a single sheet of newspaper.

367
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,000
Whoever can balance the longest

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,320
Whoever can balance the longest

369
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,240
gets to pick the room and roommate.

370
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Good?

371
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,720
Let's go.

372
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,880
Okay, both teams get ready.

373
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,760
Yeah!

374
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,600
Go easy on me, Bay.

375
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,760
Start!

376
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,080
[blows whistle]

377
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,680
Hey, Pao.

378
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Let me have this.

379
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,160
Who are you going to room with?

380
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,920
If you let me win,

381
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,040
I’ll treat you to a buffet at 5-star hotel.

382
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,640
A buffet at 5-star hotel?

383
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah.

384
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,520
I'm not a idiot.

385
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,320
I want to room with Boom.

386
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,880
I need someone I'm close to.

387
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,400
Sorry, man.

388
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,960
A buffet won’t save you.

389
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,560
Go!

390
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,760
Ow.

391
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
[laughing]

392
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,120
Pao!

393
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
Pao wins!

394
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,400
Victory!

395
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,120
I pick Boom.

396
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,560
[laughing]

397
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Bay, you’re weak.

398
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,320
Damn it.

399
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,160
Phat,

400
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,400
you’re with me.

401
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,720
Alright,

402
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,320
that’s everyone paired up.

403
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay.

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,120
Okay.

405
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,240
Bay.

406
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,440
Hm?

407
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,280
I’m screwed.

408
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,760
I have to room with Pao.

409
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,080
I won’t sleep a wink tonight.

410
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
Good luck, bro.

411
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,520
I didn’t have to pay for a buffet.

412
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,600
Pao’s an idiot.

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, true.

414
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey, what’s that?

415
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,480
Pao’s a genius.

416
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,440
Oh.

417
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,000
Super smart.

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Of course I am, Boom.

419
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,960
Jeez, dude.

420
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,040
Let's keep going.

421
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,760
Next round!

422
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
Fold the newspaper, Boom.

423
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,040
That was too easy.

424
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,040
Here we go.

425
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,360
Hill and Art, ready?

426
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,520
Take your positions.

427
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,000
Start!

428
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
[blows whistle]

429
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,840
No matter what, I’m not losing this game.

430
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,400
Tonight, I'm rooming with Junji.

431
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,520
We’ll see about that.

432
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
Let’s find out who’s more persistent.

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,240
Let’s find out who’s more persistent.

434
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,920
Heh.

435
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,320
Hey,

436
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,480
who's going to win?

437
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,720
I can’t even tell.

438
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,400
Dude.

439
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,040
Doesn't look like they’re competing…

440
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,800
but helping—

441
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,600
Helping each other.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,840
It's too damn hot.

443
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,240
When will they be done?

444
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,800
Right.

445
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,240
You still haven’t given up?

446
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,240
No way.

447
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,080
I can do this all day.

448
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,720
And you?

449
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,760
Can you?

450
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Ha.

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,120
Of course I can.

452
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,280
But I can’t!

453
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,880
[blows whistle]

454
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,880
What?

455
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,680
Hey!

456
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,800
It’s scorching out here.

457
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,240
Let’s stop.

458
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,640
Break it up.

459
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,360
Hold on.

460
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,880
We still don’t have a winner.

461
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,720
Let’s call it…

462
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,600
a tie.

463
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,680
Huh?

464
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,560
But—

465
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,640
But why, Junji?

466
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,320
Yeah.

467
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,840
You two have been at it for ages,

468
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,320
and you’ve lasted this long.

469
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,800
That's amazing.

470
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,200
How about

471
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,280
you two share a room?

472
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
Boss gets his own room.

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
Alright? Break it up.

474
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,600
My skin’s burning here.

475
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,120
No way!

476
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,600
I have to room with Art?

477
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,720
You and him

478
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,160
can talk about work.

479
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,960
You have

480
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,360
qualities that

481
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
help each other.

482
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,520
Boss.

483
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,520
Let’s go.

484
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,200
Come on.

485
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,480
So,

486
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,280
Boss wins

487
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
this game.

488
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
Isn't he awesome?

489
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,200
Let’s go!

490
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
You take the bed.

491
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
I’ll sleep on the floor.

492
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,080
No way,

493
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,520
just take the bed.

494
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,040
Sorry,

495
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,280
I just don’t want us

496
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,560
to cross any lines

497
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,040
like that night.

498
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,240
I

499
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,440
didn’t mean anything

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,600
like that.

501
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,600
I just meant you take the bed,

502
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,920
I’ll sleep on the floor.

503
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,040
But—

504
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,160
No buts.

505
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,120
If you don’t sleep on the bed,

506
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,160
I won’t sleep either.

507
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,960
Okay?

508
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
You're stubborn.

509
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,960
Yep.

510
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,840
They call me King of Stubbornness.

511
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,560
Today I saw you smile,

512
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,720
I’m satisfied.

513
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,040
Nonsense.

514
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,840
Go take a shower

515
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,120
before you sleep.

516
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,800
[screams]

517
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,360
Hey!

518
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,920
Bay!

519
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,880
What?

520
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,960
Grab it!

521
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,200
A baby lizard?

522
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,520
Doesn't matter the size,

523
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
They are all scary to me.

524
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,440
Hurry,

525
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,360
Catch it!

526
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,280
Wait, wait.

527
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,200
If you

528
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,320
sleep on the bed,

529
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,160
I get the floor,

530
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,880
then I'll do it.

531
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,320
Fine. I’ll sleep on the bed!

532
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,080
What was that?

533
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,800
I’ll sleep on the bed!

534
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,840
Hurry up and catch it!

535
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,720
Very well.

536
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
Take it outside.

537
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,600
Done.

538
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,120
Bay!

539
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,360
Come on.

540
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,960
Not funny.

541
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,200
It’s gone now.

542
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,800
See?

543
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,320
47

544
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,000
48

545
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,160
49

546
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,160
50

547
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,920
[sighs]

548
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,840
[exhales slowly]

549
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,840
You should exercise more.

550
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,840
It’ll make you healthier.

551
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,520
But honestly, I think getting enough sleep

552
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,320
isn’t such a bad idea either.

553
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,240
But right now,

554
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,960
I can’t sleep.

555
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,280
Tomorrow, you’ll be able to.

556
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,600
Because you’ll be by yourself.

557
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
Why’s that?

558
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,360
You’re giving up and…

559
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
go back home?

560
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,960
The one who's going home

561
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,360
would be you.

562
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,480
If I leave,

563
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
I’ll leave with Boss.

564
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,000
Let me be clear with you.

565
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,440
Let me be clear with you.

566
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,560
I like Junji.

567
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,200
And tomorrow, I’m going to win him back.

568
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,520
A newbie like you

569
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,600
doesn't know the history between us.

570
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,400
Our relationship

571
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
back when we worked on
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

572
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,600
Hmph.

573
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,200
Oh, please.

574
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,080
That game you abandoned?

575
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,440
Don’t act like some old man reminiscing.

576
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,200
You don’t need to tell me.

577
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,240
Don’t want to hear it.

578
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,160
It’s a waste of time.

579
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,880
All I know is

580
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,560
if it had been good,

581
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
you wouldn’t have to apologize to him.

582
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,640
Live in the present, okay?

583
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,520
I’m glad

584
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,600
you came back.

585
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,040
So let’s help each other

586
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,600
make this game a success.

587
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,640
And don’t do anything,

588
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,920
or act in any way,

589
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,000
that’ll hurt him again.

590
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,760
that’ll hurt him again.

591
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,520
Okay.

592
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,520
Tomorrow, just wait and see.

593
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
But know this,

594
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
when it comes to him,

595
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
I'll never give up.

596
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,280
Hey, Bay.

597
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,880
So,

598
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,240
are we allowed to film here?

599
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,800
Ugh, my head hurts…

600
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
What a headache.

601
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,680
Dude.

602
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,600
What’s wrong?

603
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Did you hit your head?

604
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,920
This is

605
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,000
work, not a vacation.

606
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,520
work, not a vacation.

607
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,440
I know. I'm using my head right now!

608
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,040
For work?

609
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,520
Yeah.

610
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
About Phat?

611
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,880
Ugh…

612
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
You got me.

613
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,480
There's only him.

614
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,080
What did you do this time?

615
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
I don’t even know…

616
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,560
I…

617
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,560
I must’ve done something.

618
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,960
But

619
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,800
yesterday things were fine.

620
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,240
Nothing happened but…

621
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,960
Hey,

622
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,680
be honest, okay?

623
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,680
Do you like Phat?

624
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,520
Of course I do.

625
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Never felt this way about anyone before.

626
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,800
Good.

627
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,200
If you like him,

628
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,320
you’ve got to prove

629
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,760
that you're here to stay.

630
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,840
That's what I’ve been doing!

631
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,080
Isn't it obvious?

632
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,120
It is.

633
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,320
But

634
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,720
I don’t think it’s enough.

635
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,880
Given your

636
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,120
colorful history.

637
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Hey,

638
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,480
Hill.

639
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,600
Are you insulting me?

640
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,040
Just speaking the truth.

641
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,320
Bay.

642
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,600
What?

643
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,120
Help me out.

644
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,600
When I

645
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
bring Boss here to present this spot,

646
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,240
I want you to

647
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,440
set off some fireworks.

648
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Create a vibe, yeah?

649
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,520
Wow.

650
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,840
Why you…

651
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,640
So first you insult me,

652
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,840
and now you want my help?

653
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,080
Yeah?

654
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,080
Come on, please.

655
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,760
[sighs]

656
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,800
Oh, come on.

657
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,120
Bay.

658
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,400
So,

659
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,840
what’s going on with Bay?

660
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,320
Where's the bright and cheerful Phat?

661
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,240
Is it really that obvious?

662
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,360
Well,

663
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,840
you’ve been so quiet.

664
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,040
It's suffocating.

665
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,280
Is it about your mom?

666
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,640
Phat,

667
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,880
you seem to like Bay

668
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,640
quite a lot.

669
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,200
Mom's just a part of it.

670
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,280
Another part of me is scared

671
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,240
he’ll leave me.

672
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,400
Not sure if I’m enough

673
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,320
to really make him like me.

674
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,160
If you already like him,

675
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,320
then there’s nothing to be afraid of.

676
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,800
What about you?

677
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,520
How long are you going
to keep them in a race?

678
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,640
It'll be awkward for them as co-workers.

679
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
Why?

680
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,000
Can’t they just be

681
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,160
normal co-workers?

682
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
Have you forgotten?

683
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,560
Both of them like you.

684
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,760
Maybe

685
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,320
you should stop the race

686
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,080
and face them at the finish line.

687
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,400
Trust what’s inside your heart, my friend.

688
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,960
There they are.

689
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,040
Boss, can we join in?

690
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,440
Come on.

691
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,000
You two must be lonely.

692
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,320
Boss…

693
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,880
I think…

694
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,280
Since we are

695
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,800
doing activities here anyway,

696
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,360
we should do something

697
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,880
to build team spirit.

698
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,600
What do you say?

699
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,280
Sure.

700
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,560
Wow, this is the first time

701
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,360
Pao has come up with something nice.

702
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,920
I do it all the time!

703
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,680
What do you think, Boss?

704
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
sounds good.

705
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,640
Since we are here

706
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,120
surveying the place,

707
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,160
let’s take this chance

708
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,960
to do a group activity.

709
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,600
Yeah!

710
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,240
But I’ll warn you,

711
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,760
if you're going against me,

712
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,800
be prepared to lose.

713
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,960
But if

714
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,920
it’s just about winning, that's no fun.

715
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
How about we…

716
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,640
…give losers

717
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,920
the barbecue duty.

718
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,480
Deal?

719
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,120
Damn.

720
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,560
That's smart

721
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,000
and cheeky.

722
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,440
I like it.

723
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:22,960
I’m in.

724
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm sold.

725
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Of course!

726
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,480
My team has never lost
at any office sports event.

727
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,920
Really?

728
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,880
Never lost?

729
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,240
Never.

730
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,280
Yeah, right.

731
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,880
It’s true!

732
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,080
Team up with me.

733
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,360
What?

734
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,960
I want to win.

735
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:34,880
Okay?

736
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,720
Fine,

737
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,360
it's a deal.

738
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,720
For selfishness,

739
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,440
you've got to give it to Pao.

740
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,600
What?

741
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,720
I just want to win.

742
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,880
What’s going on? Let me join too!

743
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Oh.

744
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,960
- This is gonna be fun.
- Very fun.

745
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,840
Alright then.

746
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,520
Me,

747
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,000
Boom,

748
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,400
Boom,

749
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,000
and Ching

750
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,680
will be the referees.

751
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:03,840
Great.

752
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,560
Okay.

753
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,920
So, three people per team.

754
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,160
It's beach volleyball.

755
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,640
If you lose,

756
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,120
you’re on barbecue duty tonight.

757
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,240
Okay?

758
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,120
Okay!

759
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,480
Referees, take your positions

760
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,320
you’re in the way.

761
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,440
Go, go!

762
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,480
Want to lose?

763
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,640
Hey, don't!

764
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,800
Everyone stay behind me.

765
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,200
I’ll handle it.

766
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,200
Wow.

767
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,440
Our hero’s stepping up.

768
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,200
But I’ll say this,

769
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,560
us villains are totally

770
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,600
going to win.

771
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,280
Hey, Junji.

772
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,640
What?

773
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,840
Are you okay?

774
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,520
You tired?

775
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,560
You can rest,

776
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
I’ll take care of it.

777
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,760
You’ll get sunburned.

778
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,280
Ouch, sunburn.

779
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,760
Can I

780
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,280
Can I switch to the hero’s team?

781
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,680
Hey.

782
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Hey, Hill!

783
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,720
You can’t switch to their team.

784
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,160
You better not throw the game.

785
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,880
Stay here.

786
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,440
Jeez.

787
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
Are we gonna keep talking?

788
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,000
I want to finish this fast.

789
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
I want to finish this fast.

790
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,560
Whoa

791
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,800
Boss.

792
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,760
If you say that,

793
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,160
then don’t be mad

794
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
if I go all out.

795
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,880
Right now, we're no friends.

796
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
So smash with all you've got.

797
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Whoa.

798
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,800
Now you’ll see

799
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
what the real deal looks like.

800
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,480
Oh, yeah!

801
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,520
Damn.

802
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,240
This match will be intense.

803
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,960
but I think Boss will definitely win.

804
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,760
Hey, Hill.

805
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
We've got to win

806
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,080
to look cool.

807
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,600
So,

808
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,480
let’s get fired up.

809
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,400
- Huh?
- What?

810
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,640
Get fired up.

811
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,400
- Huh?
- That's cool?

812
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,080
Yeah, cool.

813
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,480
Really?

814
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,320
Fine.

815
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
Bay, Hill, Pao, then…

816
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,880
Fighting Osu!

817
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Bay, Hill, Pao?

818
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,520
This is cool?

819
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,080
It is cool.

820
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,840
Right…

821
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,960
- Go.
- One, two, three!

822
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,920
Bay! Hill! Pao!

823
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,840
What the heck?

824
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,600
Let’s go!

825
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,240
Osu!

826
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,480
Come on!

827
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,160
Come on!

828
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,080
They're intimidated.

829
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,560
Come on!

830
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,120
Alright.

831
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,560
Let’s start!

832
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,080
[blows whistle]

833
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,040
[grunts]

834
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,640
[grunts]

835
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,240
Yeah!

836
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,760
[blows whistle]

837
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,800
- Go, Boss!
- Point for this team!

838
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,480
[grunts]

839
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,680
Yeah!

840
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,680
This is tough!

841
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,080
Hurry up and serve!

842
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,480
Where did the ball go?

843
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
I got it!

844
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,160
Here!

845
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,840
Got it?

846
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
Ouch!

847
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,880
[excited cheering]

848
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,440
Yeah!

849
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,440
This team scored again!

850
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,400
Right now, both teams

851
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,120
are just one point apart.

852
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,960
If Boss' team scores again,

853
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
it's over.

854
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,000
And Pao…

855
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,720
will get to do the barbecue.

856
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:43,840
Hey.

857
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,560
I asked you to be a referee,

858
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,800
not a sports commentator.

859
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Aw, come on.

860
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm being a delight.

861
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,440
A delight, my ass.

862
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,720
Dude.

863
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,920
You're insulting on us.

864
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,320
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

865
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,560
Huh.

866
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Final point, huh?

867
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,000
Let's end this game right here.

868
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,080
Wow… Listen to Mr. Art over here.

869
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,040
He’s looking down on us, Hill!

870
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,560
- Yeah, give him hell.
- Go for it.

871
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,000
Don't count

872
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
your chickens.

873
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,320
Huh?

874
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,200
- Huh?
- What?

875
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Wait a second, Hill.

876
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,680
It's weird.

877
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,040
Yeah.

878
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,840
What's that?

879
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,960
Why are you looking at us?

880
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,520
You insulting us?

881
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,680
A compliment.

882
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,320
A compliment!

883
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,480
We're fierce roosters.

884
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:21,840
Exactly.

885
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,320
- Go!
- Go!

886
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
- We will win!
- Fight!

887
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,320
Yeah!

888
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,280
Let's go!

889
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
- Come on!
- Focus!

890
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,600
Go!

891
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,520
[blows whistle]

892
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
- Alright!
- Yeah!

893
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,440
There.

894
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,000
It's up to you now, Bay!

895
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,520
Whoa.

896
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,800
A perfect set for you, Hill.

897
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,080
I’m counting on you!

898
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,960
I got you, bro.

899
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,120
Damn!

900
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,720
I…

901
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,680
I'm sorry, Boss.

902
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,960
Hill, worry about your own team first!

903
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,200
Smash it, Hill!

904
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,000
You're our hope!

905
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,760
Smash it!

906
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:26,880
- Smash it!
- Smash it!

907
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
- Crap!
- Shit!

908
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,160
Whoa!

909
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,400
Damn!

910
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,240
Bay.

911
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,600
Huh?

912
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,640
Pao's so mad his face turns red.

913
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,720
I don’t think so.

914
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,440
Half his face is red.

915
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,360
I think that’s from
getting hit by the ball.

916
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,040
Thanks to you, Hill.

917
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
But at least

918
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,280
you won Boss’ heart.

919
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,720
And?

920
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,400
You won barbecue duty, idiot.

921
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,960
Ow!

922
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,640
Damn, that hurts like hell.

923
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,160
Hey, over here!

924
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,000
Going to treat it.

925
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,600
Going to treat it.

926
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,560
Hill,

927
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,600
you just need to smash it.

928
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,840
Pao.

929
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,760
I’m really sorry.

930
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,920
I’ll grill just one piece.

931
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,200
You handle the rest.

932
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,720
Got it.

933
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,240
Don’t take it too hard, P’Pao.

934
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,320
Losing’s not a big deal.

935
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,720
The winner just gets to eat first.

936
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,320
Look, a flamingo.

937
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,720
Yeah, a flamingo.

938
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,800
That turned into…

939
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,520
…grilled chicken.

940
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,320
The flamingo.

941
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,960
Flamingo?

942
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,720
Right here.

943
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,920
Be quick

944
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,120
and finish grilling.

945
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,160
I’ll take this

946
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,120
over there first.

947
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,400
Okay?

948
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,160
Hurry up, okay?

949
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,840
Got it.

950
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,200
Good.

951
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,440
I’ll leave it to you.

952
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,120
Sure thing.

953
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,600
Alright.

954
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,800
Let’s go.

955
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,400
I’m hungry.

956
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
That's so much food.

957
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,960
I’ll be right back.

958
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,480
[clears throat]

959
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,040
This game is over.

960
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,120
I’d better go get ready.

961
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,280
That's burnt.

962
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,800
Can I sit here?

963
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,840
You're asking?

964
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,680
That’s oddly polite of you.

965
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,080
Oh,

966
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,000
so being polite’s a problem?

967
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
so being polite’s a problem?

968
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,880
How is it?

969
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,680
Chef Bay’s black pepper pork steak

970
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
guaranteed by…

971
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,040
…four Michelin tires.

972
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:08,840
Tasty?

973
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,440
Isn't it Michelin stars?

974
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,000
Anything else?

975
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,080
I’ll sit with the others.

976
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,240
Hey, wait.

977
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,360
I like you, Phat.

978
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,240
Can you stop already?

979
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,760
It could just be

980
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,960
a fleeting feeling, like with the others.

981
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,760
What?

982
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,440
Say it again.

983
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,120
The waves are… loud.

984
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,400
I’m completely certain

985
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,320
about how I feel for you. It’s real.

986
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,560
I…

987
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,680
I can’t hold myself back anymore.

988
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,960
From the moment I met you

989
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,720
up to that night,

990
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,320
none of it was shallow.

991
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,280
Are you sure

992
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,040
you won’t get tired of me?

993
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,640
Everything that’s happened,

994
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,080
including that night,

995
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,520
made me feel genuinely happy.

996
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,720
So much that it scares me.

997
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,920
Well…

998
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,480
About what?

999
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,920
I’m afraid I’ll end up like
the others you’ve been with.

1000
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,160
My feelings for you went

1001
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,280
from zero to a hundred.

1002
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,400
You’ve made me realize what real love is.

1003
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,000
Sorry I made you uncomfortable.

1004
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,840
I can wait.

1005
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,840
But I want you

1006
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,680
to know that

1007
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,520
I don’t want you to fight for us all alone.

1008
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,200
I want to prove to you

1009
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,960
that I’m worthy of you.

1010
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,680
I also don’t want to keep
lying to myself anymore.

1011
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,320
Since that time…

1012
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,120
I’ve always worn the ring you gave me.

1013
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,080
I'm sorry…

1014
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,480
for lying to myself all this time.

1015
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,040
I like you, Bay.

1016
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,400
Oh, Boss.

1017
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,880
Are you okay?

1018
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,520
The pork

1019
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,120
is a little raw.

1020
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,120
Oh.

1021
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,440
Then,

1022
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,040
you can

1023
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
wait at the table.

1024
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,640
I’ll handle

1025
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,280
this myself.

1026
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,360
Let me. Because I

1027
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,000
won't burn it.

1028
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,600
Boss.

1029
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,280
Have faith in me.

1030
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,960
Just kidding.

1031
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,720
I want you to rest a bit.

1032
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,960
You’ve done enough.

1033
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,240
Well…

1034
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,520
This is…

1035
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,320
It's just

1036
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,960
something

1037
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,080
I have to do

1038
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,480
as a loser, isn't it?

1039
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,360
You really take competitions seriously.

1040
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,960
Thanks for today.

1041
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,840
What for?

1042
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,080
Everything.

1043
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,560
Like…

1044
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,880
When we were playing

1045
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,960
volleyball.

1046
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,400
Thanks for

1047
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,320
not hitting a spike.

1048
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,920
If I could go back in time, Boss…

1049
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,160
I’d still

1050
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
choose to lose to you.

1051
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,880
So I could protect you.

1052
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,120
I've got a question.

1053
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:25,560
Sure.

1054
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,000
If one day

1055
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,960
you find out

1056
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,680
Yuka lied to you,

1057
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,440
would you be angry?

1058
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,760
Why do you feel guilty about Yuka?

1059
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,360
I mean,

1060
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,880
Yuka and Junji

1061
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,320
are the same person.

1062
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,840
And I’m sure,

1063
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,680
people like Junji

1064
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,000
never intend to hurt others’ feelings.

1065
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,000
If Yuka lied to me,

1066
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,000
I probably won't be angry.

1067
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,240
I probably won't be angry.

1068
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,640
Because I believe

1069
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,920
that she

1070
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,160
must have had

1071
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,960
a good reason for it.

1072
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,760
As thanks,

1073
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,520
I will

1074
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,840
make you a steak.

1075
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:43,880
Here.

1076
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,000
This pork steak is for you.

1077
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,720
Wow…

1078
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,800
Is it edible, Boss?

1079
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,480
Then don’t eat it.

1080
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,320
Hang on.

1081
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,360
I was just kidding.

1082
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,320
Boss…

1083
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,000
you can sulk too, huh?

1084
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,440
you can sulk too, huh?

1085
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,120
Boss…

1086
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,160
What?

1087
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,840
Well…

1088
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,720
didn’t you say

1089
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,120
you're giving it to me?

1090
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,840
Oh damn!

1091
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,600
Boss.

1092
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,920
It’s really delicious.

1093
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,200
It's so tender

1094
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,680
and

1095
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,120
that juicy gravy sauce

1096
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,120
is amazing.

1097
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:33,840
Boss,

1098
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,120
I mean it.

1099
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,600
Open a restaurant.

1100
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,720
If I did,

1101
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,760
I wouldn't let you help.

1102
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,200
Why?

1103
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,840
The customers might say

1104
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:42,960
it’s not good.

1105
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,120
Jeez…

1106
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,440
Boss, you’re being mean.

1107
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,080
Want to try mine?

1108
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,120
- Here.
- Okay.

1109
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,080
Let’s see.

1110
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,760
Here.

1111
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,000
Boss, fancy a bite?

1112
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,360
I’m full.

1113
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,520
Boss,

1114
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,440
Art said

1115
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,880
he wants to show you something.

1116
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,360
Said it's all prepared.

1117
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,680
Oh.

1118
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:06,640
Alright.

1119
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,080
Shall we go now?

1120
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,840
Let’s go.

1121
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,960
Come with us, Hill.

1122
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,880
Art said

1123
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,280
the client's work is all done

1124
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,160
and ready to present.

1125
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,560
- Boss, let’s go.
- Sure.

1126
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,480
Junji.

1127
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,640
You prepared all this?

1128
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:16,920
Yes.

1129
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,040
I prepared all of this for you, Junji.

1130
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,880
This is the grand,

1131
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,960
perfect finale of this game.

1132
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,760
The reason I came back

1133
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,440
is because I want you to know

1134
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
I'll stand by your side again.

1135
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,920
And help you succeed at everything.

1136
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,760
Like when we worked on
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

1137
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,000
Just a second.

1138
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,080
Just a second.

1139
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
Wow.

1140
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,920
Now,

1141
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,120
I know that my heart

1142
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,720
is with you.

1143
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,880
So…

1144
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,040
please forgive me.

1145
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,440
Man,

1146
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,800
this isn’t

1147
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,760
just presenting a project to him.

1148
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:35,880
This is like

1149
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,720
a surprise proposal to Boss!

1150
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,440
Seriously?

1151
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:38,760
Damn.

1152
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,000
He went all out.

1153
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,560
- Dude.
- Hey!

1154
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,640
Where are you going?

1155
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,840
Hill!

1156
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,240
Jeez.

1157
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,000
I love you and it’s driving me crazy.

1158
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,760
Wait, wait, wait.

1159
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,520
I know how you feel.

1160
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,480
We’ve kissed, we’ve hold each other,

1161
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,760
but I want to hear it.

1162
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,600
Let me hear it.

1163
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,960
I like you too.

1164
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,080
Hello, Hill.

1165
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,520
It’s been a long time.

1166
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,920
I’ve missed you so much.

1167
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,560
How are you?

1168
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,360
I'm fine.

1169
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,000
I’m sorry…

1170
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,880
…that lately,

1171
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,440
I haven’t talked to you much.

1172
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,360
It’s totally fine.

1173
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,600
I'm always right here.

1174
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,600
You can see me anytime.

1175
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,320
Is there anything you want me to do?

1176
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,560
Well…

1177
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,560
Nothing really, Yuka.

1178
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,360
I’m just sitting by the sea.

1179
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,400
It’s beautiful.

1180
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,080
I just

1181
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,200
don’t want to be alone.

1182
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,520
I’m glad the sea is beautiful.

1183
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,920
But since you don’t want to be alone,

1184
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,120
does that mean you’re lonely?

1185
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,760
Well…

1186
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,320
I guess

1187
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,560
you could call it that.

1188
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,920
If that’s how you see it.

1189
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,760
Do you want me to keep you company?

1190
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
Mm…

1191
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,840
Then I…

1192
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,560
Can I ask you something?

1193
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,160
If there's

1194
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,680
something you wanted to say

1195
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,200
but

1196
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,000
you missed the chance to say it…

1197
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,800
you missed the chance to say it…

1198
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,640
If it were you,

1199
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,200
what would you do?

1200
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,400
If you didn’t seize that chance,

1201
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,560
it’s no big deal.

1202
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,080
If it were me,

1203
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,680
I’d create the opportunity myself.

1204
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,720
Yeah…

1205
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,480
I see.

1206
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,680
Thank you so much, Yuka.

1207
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,680
I believe

1208
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,600
that saying it out loud

1209
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,200
is better than keeping it inside.

1210
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,800
Ganbatte ne!

1211
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,360
Hill.

1212
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,320
So you’re here.

1213
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,280
I’ve been looking for you.

1214
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,120
The sponsored game scene

1215
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,760
in your style,

1216
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:08,960
how's it going?

1217
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,400
Well,

1218
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,320
did you like Art’s work?

1219
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,960
Be my boyfriend.

1220
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,400
Okay.

1221
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,360
I promise

1222
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,120
I’ll never leave.

1223
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,240
And I’ll hold you tight.

1224
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,480
That’s too tight.

1225
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,920
No, not tight enough.

1226
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,280
Hold on.

1227
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,280
Didn’t you say you’d hold me tight?

1228
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,200
Why’d you let go?

1229
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,440
That's not it.

1230
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,120
Phat, will you

1231
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,800
help me out?

1232
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,640
Hurry.

1233
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,520
I’m sorry

1234
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,040
for asking about someone else’s work.

1235
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,080
If I liked Art’s work,

1236
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,680
would I have walked over here?

1237
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,520
What about your work?

1238
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,360
What's it like?

1239
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,800
My scene?

1240
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,000
I think

1241
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,760
it has to be sincere.

1242
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,640
No need to try to make it flashy.

1243
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,720
Easy to understand

1244
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,000
and feel natural.

1245
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,800
and feel natural.

1246
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,480
Because…

1247
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,120
I think

1248
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,120
if it’s Yuka-chan,

1249
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,320
she wouldn’t like

1250
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,480
discussing personal matters publicly.

1251
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,720
Yuka-chan

1252
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,520
likes things simple.

1253
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,680
She’d probably just want to
hear the sound of the waves,

1254
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,560
calmly

1255
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,280
hitting the shore

1256
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,800
and…

1257
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,960
speak heart-to-heart.

1258
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,720
Just the two of us

1259
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,680
on the beach.

1260
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,160
I think

1261
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,680
she’d like that better.

1262
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,040
And I

1263
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,520
would hold her hand,

1264
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,440
and thank her.

1265
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,680
Thank her

1266
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,400
for always encouraging me.

1267
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,960
Thank her

1268
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,200
for making me

1269
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,960
see my own self worth again.

1270
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,800
And I’d like to thank her

1271
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,800
for making

1272
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
my life

1273
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,560
meaningful every single day.

1274
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,680
Junji-san

1275
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,720
I love you.

1276
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,160
Hill…

1277
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,760
Are you telling me

1278
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,520
or

1279
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,920
Yuka?

1280
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,440
This is so pretty?

1281
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,680
When you said

1282
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,080
to hurry over,

1283
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,800
you meant to do something like this?

1284
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,280
Of course.

1285
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,800
Hill planned to have fireworks in the game,

1286
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,960
but we still hadn’t decided

1287
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,040
when to set them off.

1288
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,880
I thought this was the perfect time.

1289
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,480
Cute.

1290
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,760
You mean

1291
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,720
Hill?

1292
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,360
No. You’re cute,

1293
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,520
doing something like this.

1294
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,360
Aw, come on…

1295
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,240
But honestly,

1296
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,000
we only

1297
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,440
planned this to help sell the project.

1298
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:41,960
How did it

1299
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,920
turn into that?

1300
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,840
Hill is really something, huh?

1301
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,320
[sighs]

1302
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,280
Look at them.

1303
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,000
Beautiful?

1304
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,240
Hashtag,

1305
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,640
#BanYukaGame

1306
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,600
The real Yuka

1307
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,480
is Boss Junji,

1308
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,000
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand.

1309
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,120
the famous CEO of PRISMSTAR Thailand.

1310
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,720
As for our relationship,

1311
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,320
it’s better not to jump the gun.

1312
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,840
Our parent company wants
to hold a press conference.

1313
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,440
What?

1314
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,320
So you revealed this

1315
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,080
to make Junji notice you?

1316
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,800
You have to leave Junji

1317
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,880
and resign from this company.

1318
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,320
What's your excuse?

1319
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,000
How do you plan to fix this?
