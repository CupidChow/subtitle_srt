1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,440
Was that…

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,560
- Boss.
- Boss.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,760
Let's wrap up "Yuka! Love Me Please"

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,000
properly.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,120
I love you, Yuka.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,600
We're going to start developing a new game.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
For this project, Hill will be
the Main Character Designer.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,200
Me?

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,840
You better start learning
how to hit on guys.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,040
As you all know, the game we're developing

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,800
has to be more lifelike than ever before.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,880
The first and the most important thing.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,040
is finding real people
as our character reference.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,280
Just like what we did for
"Yuka! Love Me Please"

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,640
Go ahead.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,800
Are you saying that Yuka's reference

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,000
was a real-life idol,
like in the presentation?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
was a real-life idol,
like in the presentation?

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
Nice try, Hill.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,240
You only need to know
that the selling point

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,240
of "Yuka! Love Me Please"
comes from a real-life idol.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,960
So we're going to build upon
that concept in this game,

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,600
making the interactions
feel even more realistic.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,440
[crowd murmuring]

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,720
Isn’t that Hojun, the famous artist
with millions of followers?

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,480
Is he really going to become
our character reference?

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,520
Of course,

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,840
in your dreams.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He’s just a reference
to get us on the same page.

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,880
We need to find someone who's similar.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Hang on.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
We're developers, not a casting agent.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,040
Why are we the ones
finding reference material?

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm so glad you asked, bro.

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
Since you’re a newbie,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
Since you’re a newbie,

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,640
let me explain this real quick.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
This is Game Designer department.

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,760
In order to create a good game,

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,600
we need to know
our characters inside and out.

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,600
And to know them that deeply,

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,760
we’ve got to dig deep to their very cores.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,320
Come here, Hill.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Quickly.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,360
As the fresh new blood here,

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,680
you’re our only hope.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,800
From now on, Hill will lead the search
for our character references.

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Yay!

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,400
There he goes again.
Passing the buck to the newbie.

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm just a programmer.
I can't deal with people.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,640
You see, little bro.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,360
I overheard you and Boss talking,
about Yuka being a hostage.

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,040
I’m holding Yuka hostage.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
If you put in the effort,

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,920
I might extend Yuka's life.

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,280
He extended Yuka's game
for one more year!

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Incredible, right?

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Therefore,

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,520
you don't get to slack off. Got it?

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
For Yuka's sake.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,160
- For Yuka.
- For Yuka. That's right.

62
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,000
Hi there, Hill.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's say we had to create

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
a male version of Yuka,

65
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,520
what kind of person
should we use as a reference?

66
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,320
I think they should be kind and determined,

67
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,160
someone you can rely on when
things go wrong. Just like me!

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,880
How's that?

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,640
A guy this perfect?

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,160
They just don't exist.

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,000
But you're going to find them.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,920
For Yuka.

73
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,960
Guys, a round of applause!

74
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
Excuse me, Boss.

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Please, go ahead.

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,280
Thanks.

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,600
So how are things going with your new role?

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,320
It's pretty exciting.

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Seems easy,

80
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,560
I think.

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
You think it's easy?

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,760
Yes.

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,560
There are many influencers these days.

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
I’ll have a lot of options
for you to choose from.

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,000
You sound confident.
Is finding the right person so easy?

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,360
You sound confident.
Is finding the right person so easy?

87
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
Just so you know,

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
This company

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,960
isn't a training ground.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,080
You're right, but I'm confident.

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,040
I'll definitely find you
suitable options within two days.

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
I'll be waiting.

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
Hey.

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Bay?

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,600
What?

96
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,720
Do we really have to dress up for this?

97
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Of course! We're on a mission
to find someone.

98
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,480
Trust me. This is the way.

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,480
Good. I've promised Boss

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,080
we'll find someone within two days.

101
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
[chokes]

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,680
Two days?!

103
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Yup.

104
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Where did you get that confidence from?

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,080
I wasn't confident.
I kind of blurted it out.

106
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,040
Oh man...

107
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,840
Don't worry.

108
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,000
I did my homework.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,640
I did my homework.

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,840
Every candidate I've chosen are top-notch.

111
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,680
I'm telling you. Two days won't be enough.

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,200
Dude, you still don't know how sharp he is?

113
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,480
And for a reference, it has to be flawless!

114
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,560
Chill out. No need to panic.

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,760
Here, look at this.

116
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,480
This guy. He might be
the one we've been looking for.

117
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,000
Fine.

118
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,160
Here, look at this.

119
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,800
This guy. He might be
the one we've been looking for.

120
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Fine.

121
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,480
Hello Mr. Bay and Mr. Hill.

122
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

123
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,560
Allow me to introduce myself again.

124
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm Billy. I'm 22 years old.
I have 100 million in savings.

125
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
I own 20 luxury cars

126
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
and five vacation homes in Khao Yai.

127
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,200
Amazing.

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,680
Given your wealth,
why volunteer as our reference?

129
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,040
Actually, money isn't that important to me.

130
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,000
But I feel like this project
could be a great opportunity

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,080
But I feel like this project
could be a great opportunity

132
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,520
to be a good role model and inspire others.

133
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,400
Mr. Billy, not only rich
but also kind-hearted.

134
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,760
Sounds like bragging.

135
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,840
- Mr. Billy.
- Yes?

136
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,800
I heard that

137
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,640
you recently donated to a hospital?

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,240
I did. It was ten million baht.

139
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,040
Ten million?!

140
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,160
Oh, it wasn't a big deal.

141
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,200
I think of it as my duty

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
to help my fellow humans.

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,560
Right.

144
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,600
Mr. Bill and Mr. Hill,

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,960
I’d be the best fit as
a reference material for this project.

146
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,400
I promise,

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,360
I won’t let either of you down.

148
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,800
Deal.

149
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
Thank you, Mr. Billy.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll present your profile
in the next meeting

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,520
I'll present your profile
in the next meeting

152
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,680
and I'll get back to you.

153
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
No need to be so formal.

154
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
From now on, just call me Billy.

155
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,400
- I'm young, loaded and owns—
- 100 websites.

156
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Billy!

157
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,360
You’re under arrest for
operating 100 illegal websites.

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Move it.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,400
Officer, I think you've made a mistake.

160
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,880
I'm operating illegal websites?

161
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,400
I've been framed!

162
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't forget the promise you made!

163
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
So this guy is young, loaded
and owns illegal websites?

164
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,640
Be considerate. Sounds good.

165
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,840
Bay.

166
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,160
What?

167
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,760
He's here.

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,720
This guy?

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,240
Yup.

170
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,600
Let's go.

171
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:04,960
Hello.

172
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,480
Hello.

173
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,280
I’m Hill.

174
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,400
I’m Bay.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,480
We’re from PRISMSTAR Thailand,

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,040
a game developer.

177
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,080
We're looking for
a reference material right now.

178
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
And that's why—

179
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,560
Wait, was that an earthquake?

180
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,400
Hey.

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,760
You.

182
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,480
Yes?

183
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
You okay?

184
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,280
Yes, just a bit nervous. But I’m fine.

185
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,640
You want to take a moment
to calm your nerves?

186
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
Yeah. You can use the restroom.

187
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
Okay, I'll be right back. Excuse me.

188
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
That won't do.

189
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,680
Bay.

190
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,320
You see that?

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,680
Look at his muscles. His arms!

192
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
Hey, bro!

193
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,160
Help! Help!

194
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,720
Here's you hot latte.

195
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,840
Hello, there.

196
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,920
This guy won't let us down. Trust me.

197
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,520
He better not.

198
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,600
He's the last one.

199
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,360
If not him, who do we
have left to show Boss?

200
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,320
Look.

201
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,080
This barista's got a master's from abroad.

202
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,400
So?

203
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,880
to open a café in Thailand.

204
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,280
He brews

205
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,440
and serves it

206
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,240
with heart.

207
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,480
Sounds good.

208
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
He is.

209
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,880
And look at the line.

210
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,880
He's clearly popular with the ladies.

211
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
Sure.

212
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,880
The guy's got charm.

213
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,120
Here we go.

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Hello.

215
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,720
Hi.

216
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes?

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes?

218
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,480
I’ll have two iced americanos, please.

219
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,320
Two of the same?

220
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
I'll give them with extra loving.

221
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
Okay.

222
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,360
Are you the one with the appointment?

223
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,600
I am.

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,800
Alright.

225
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,040
Here you go.

226
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,400
Served with extra loving.

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,800
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

228
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
That's why he's such a promising candidate.

229
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,320
Rejected.

230
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Huh?

231
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,240
What?

232
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
But…

233
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,200
Great profile, good looks.

234
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Over 100,000 followers.

235
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,560
He's got female customers
singing his praises.

236
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,000
What’s the issue, Boss?

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,560
What’s the issue, Boss?

238
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,440
Two wives, three kids, hurts women,
ran off to study abroad for three years,

239
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,520
then came back once things quieted down.

240
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
Do you think someone with
these issues is right for the role?

241
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Well…

242
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,800
No.

243
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,440
I remember it now.

244
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,480
No wonder why he looked familiar.

245
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,400
That's the "Charming Casanova" influencer.

246
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,360
[sighs]

247
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,000
I don’t know how hard you worked,

248
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,480
but for me,

249
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,960
it’s not enough.

250
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,440
If I had not done my own research

251
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,640
and we'd picked him as our guy,

252
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,840
what do you think the game
would’ve turned out like?

253
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,120
Carelessness could hurt the company.

254
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
Is that all?

255
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,320
Of course not.

256
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,440
Everyone, Plan B.

257
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,480
See?

258
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,160
Not as easy as you thought, right?

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
[mimicking] I did my homework.

260
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,200
Every candidate I've chosen are top-notch.

261
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,800
How's that?

262
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,080
Feeling defeated yet?

263
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,160
Come on, don’t rub it in.

264
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,360
But hey, thanks for

265
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,440
having a backup plan.

266
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
Got the team to split up and search.

267
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,120
But none of them passed.

268
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
Boss is way too hardcore.

269
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,640
Yeah, his standards are way too high.

270
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,000
At this rate, will we ever launch the game?

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,440
At this rate, will we ever launch the game?

272
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,640
This is just the start,
and it's already this difficult.

273
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,160
Seriously though.

274
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,840
What?

275
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,040
Trying to find the perfect references,

276
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
they would have to be heaven sent.

277
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,280
Stop pleading with the heavens.

278
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,800
We want a normal person.

279
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,040
Hill, meet me in my office
before you leave.

280
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,600
Yes, sir.

281
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,840
- Bay.
- Yeah?

282
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,320
You come with me.

283
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,080
No way.

284
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,000
He asked for you, not me.

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Go.

286
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,200
But

287
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,840
what do we do now?

288
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,640
That's easy, man.

289
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,320
How?

290
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,400
When in doubt, hit the bar.

291
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't drink.

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,720
I don't drink.

293
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,280
Just so you know,
this particular bar is full of hotties

294
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,520
like me.

295
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Come on. You just sit with us and watch.

296
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't make him wait. I'll be downstairs.

297
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,840
Boss.

298
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,720
First, I want to apologize.

299
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,400
The stuff I said about
the heavens was just a joke.

300
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
Thai people like to
keep things light and funny.

301
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,880
You think I called you in over that?

302
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,920
If it's about work, there's no need worry.

303
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
Please give one more chance.

304
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,520
I promise I’ll find
the perfect one for the role.

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,360
What is it, Boss?

306
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,800
A welcome gift for our new employee.

307
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,320
That’s the reason I called you in.

308
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
Sorry it's a bit late.

309
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,680
You know what? This is

310
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,080
the first gift I've gotten in a decade.

311
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,320
How come?

312
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,440
Well.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The only one I'm close with is Yuka-chan.

314
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm not so close

315
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,760
with anyone besides her.

316
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,880
Thank you, Boss.

317
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Open it.

318
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,040
Can I?

319
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,640
Sure.

320
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,600
Why a water bottle, Boss?

321
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,000
Because you love grilled pork skewers.

322
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,040
Did you know, each skewer
has 500 mg of sodium?

323
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,440
Too much can be dangerous.

324
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,800
So drink lots of water.
And from the way you work,

325
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,560
I doubt you have time for exercise.

326
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,160
Why are you smiling?

327
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,760
You just remind me of my mom.

328
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,200
Thanks again, Boss.

329
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,160
And don’t worry.

330
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,560
I’ll make sure it gets put to good use.

331
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,640
And I'll hit the daily water goal as well.

332
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,320
That's it for today. You can go.

333
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,240
Okay. I’ll repay you with
some grilled pork skewers!

334
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,600
Don't bother.
Just find me the right person.

335
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,120
Roger that!

336
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
You forgot this.

337
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,560
Just go already.

338
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,920
Your "roger that" was bad.

339
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Ice would love to work with you.
But she's fully booked for this year.

340
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
We're really sorry.

341
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,120
That's a shame. I look forward to
working together in the future.

342
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,240
You still eat a ton like you did in school.

343
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,480
Especially when you're stressed.

344
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
You haven’t changed,
still as observant as ever.

345
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,360
It's called “being nosy” in Thai.

346
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,160
Are you throwing shade at me?

347
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,280
You said it yourself, not me.

348
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Let’s keep eating.

349
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
Wow.

350
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,320
Delicious.

351
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
Say it’s not tasty and
I’ll make you eat somewhere else.

352
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,080
Thanks for helping me
contact the artist's manager.

353
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,240
No worries, we’re all friends.

354
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,400
But was it helpful at all?

355
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, at least we found out

356
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,920
Yeah, at least we found out

357
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,160
celebs are fully booked until next year.

358
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Basically, no one’s taking the job.

359
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Hot!

360
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,840
Don’t forget that it’s hot.

361
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,160
Did you bite into a chili too?

362
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,280
Drink some water.

363
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,320
Relax. The right one always
shows up at the right time.

364
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,640
Looks like the time is now, friend.

365
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,120
Perfect timing.

366
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,960
Perfect for you

367
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,600
who always forget to pay.

368
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
Seriously, Bay.

369
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,840
You totally tricked me.

370
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, I heard that.

371
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,840
Come on, relax a little.

372
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,880
Step away from your desk
and enjoy yourself.

373
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,960
Don’t be a workaholic.
Go ahead and order, it’s my treat.

374
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,000
Bottoms up.

375
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,960
For real?

376
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,000
You're sipping water?

377
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,920
What a mood killer.

378
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,040
Hello there, Bay.

379
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,920
You remember me?

380
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,280
How could I forget?

381
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
You went to the restroom and disappeared.

382
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,360
I was worried.

383
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,480
I thought you drowned in the toilet.

384
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
That’s it, I flushed you.

385
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Now drift down the pipe and into

386
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
the waste tank where you belong.

387
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
Bay, she just called you crap.

388
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Hill, just shut up.

389
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,480
Hang on.

390
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,800
So badass. So dangerous.

391
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,640
I'm only asking you for one thing.

392
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,080
If anyone at work hears about this…

393
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,720
you're so dead!

394
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,800
Damn. A death threat?

395
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Yup.

396
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,240
Got it. I give you my word.

397
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,200
But look at this, we failed today.

398
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,000
And now you're drenched in plum wine.

399
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,480
The day’s not over yet.

400
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,120
Over there. That guy.

401
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Wow.

402
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,760
Just so you know,

403
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,680
this wasn’t a coincidence.
I brought you here on purpose.

404
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,280
The bartender Gotji. He studied
overseas and has spotless record.

405
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,760
While you mess around casting people,

406
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,000
I did the background checks.

407
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
A charming man who can make

408
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,000
both men and women swoon.

409
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,200
A man who’s never had a girlfriend.

410
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,400
This man is going to be our reference.

411
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,000
So this is it.

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,960
The one who brought Yuka to life.

413
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,480
You never disappoint.

414
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Cheers.

415
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,920
For you, I'll drink it all.

416
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,120
I heard from the manager team

417
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,120
that it's your project.

418
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
So I was immediately interested.

419
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,920
Actually, I’m a fan of yours too.

420
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,880
Here.

421
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,640
A young, passionate CEO like you

422
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,000
is someone I really admire.

423
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,640
This might be a bit outdated now,

424
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,080
but…

425
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,320
could I ask for your autograph?

426
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,320
As a memento.

427
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,800
Gladly.

428
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,880
I follow your work too, Mr. Hojun.

429
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,840
It’d be an honor to work with you.

430
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,480
Let me explain the details to you.

431
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,400
How about this?

432
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,440
Let’s talk about this over dinner.

433
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
If the job sounds as good as your profile,

434
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,120
I’ll say yes tonight.

435
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,120
Fair enough.

436
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,800
Alright, it’s settled.

437
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,160
Shall we go together by car?

438
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,520
My driver will drop us off.

439
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,000
Here comes trouble.

440
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,200
What trouble?

441
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,320
What's wrong?

442
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,040
Don't tell me that woman is also—

443
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,560
Today’s not my day.
I’m out, take care of the rest.

444
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,760
Hey, wait up!

445
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,920
You’re really gonna ditch me? Come on.

446
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
After all I’ve done,
you still say I’m ditching you?

447
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,080
I should've let you
struggle all on your own.

448
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,680
Don’t be mad, man.

449
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,400
Seriously, though.

450
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,200
No offense,

451
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
but you better quit being a player.

452
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,840
Your life wouldn't be this messy.

453
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,800
They all say I'm a player.

454
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,760
Even you, you also see me that way.

455
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,360
Actually, I'm pretty straightforward.

456
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,520
Is it wrong to stop seeing them
when I'm no longer interested?

457
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,320
Bay. Hey, Bay!

458
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,200
I just can’t bring myself to reject people.

459
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Bay, she picked up the glass.
This is like deja vu.

460
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,960
I'm sorry,

461
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,000
that everyone sees me as a player.

462
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,120
that everyone sees me as a player.

463
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
You better leave

464
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,040
or you'll become prey.

465
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,320
Bay!

466
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,600
Where did he go?!

467
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,960
Where'd that player run off to?

468
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,480
No idea.

469
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,000
He left a plain guy like me behind.

470
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,120
Damn, he’s fast.

471
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,080
Fine. I’ll go solo.

472
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
Hi, there.

473
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,280
I'm Hill.

474
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,080
Are you Got—

475
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
Gotji.

476
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,280
Mr. Gotji.

477
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,000
Did Bay contact you about
being our reference material?

478
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,440
And Mr. Bay?

479
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,320
Something urgent came up,

480
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,000
so he had to leave. It's just me now.

481
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,960
so he had to leave. It's just me now.

482
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,920
I'm guessing he'd told you
some basic details already.

483
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,720
So I'd like to do a quick interview.

484
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,160
Well.

485
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,280
Didn't he tell you that

486
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,440
I haven't agreed to it.

487
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,960
You’re kinda cute.

488
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,080
Sorry?

489
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,440
You’re cute. Looking flustered like that.

490
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,440
Boss.

491
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,760
So what do I have to do

492
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
to get you to agree?

493
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,160
If you beat me, I'll say yes.

494
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,040
Reference material for
the game is very important.

495
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,800
And you’ve got both
the reputation and professionalism.

496
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,440
That’s not fair. You already
know everything about me.

497
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,640
I want to know about you too.

498
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,560
More than the game, actually.

499
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,040
It’s no fun drinking alone.

500
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,480
Sorry, cocktails aren’t really my thing.

501
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,920
Come on, humor me.

502
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,480
For tonight.

503
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,200
Excuse me.

504
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,560
Bring us a large set of Special B52.

505
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,120
Just so you know, I'm really good at this.

506
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,120
You know the rules?
Whoever pockets the 9 ball wins.

507
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,440
Last round, you cleared
the table all by yourself.

508
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,560
This round, let’s spice things up a bit.

509
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,400
If you get bitten,
you chug all three shots.

510
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,520
So who gets the final say
on the reference material?

511
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,800
That would…

512
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,800
be me.

513
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,240
Since you picked me,
that means you like me right?

514
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,840
Here you go.

515
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,200
What are you looking at? You giving up?

516
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,960
Let me tell you this. You've lost
the moment you missed your shot.

517
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,520
You sound so confident.

518
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,320
How about this?

519
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
For every ball you pocket,

520
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,120
I’ll take a shot.

521
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,320
[cheering] Woohoo! Let's go!

522
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,000
Crap.

523
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,200
Crap.

524
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,600
Mr. Gotji!

525
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
What do I do?
I didn’t even get his contact info!

526
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,560
I won.

527
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,080
Let’s go.

528
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,800
Come on.

529
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,520
Where to?

530
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,800
Get in.

531
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,440
Boss isn't one to leave his jacket behind.

532
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,920
How about a kiss?

533
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,360
To test it out for the game.

534
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
If you don't want to,

535
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,760
I’ll do it myself.

536
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,800
Boss.

537
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,840
Hill.

538
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Boss! Get over here.

539
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,000
Hey!

540
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,440
Let's go, Boss.

541
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,200
Who are you?

542
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,240
I’m his bodyguard, obviously.

543
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,000
His bodyguard, huh?

544
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,440
His bodyguard, huh?

545
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,920
You're drunk.
Go home and sleep it off,

546
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,160
or this is going public. Your call.

547
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,640
You’ll regret this.

548
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,680
That’s your opinion, man.

549
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
Calm down, please.

550
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,240
Go away!

551
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,640
Please, get in the car.

552
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,960
Boss, stay still.

553
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,320
Boss.

554
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,200
Go home!

555
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,320
This way, Boss.

556
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,520
Take us away from here.

557
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,960
I,

558
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
I have to thank you.

559
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,160
My pleasure, Boss.

560
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,960
Don't worry.

561
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,560
It's part of my duty as your bodyguard.

562
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,880
Yeah, right.

563
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,000
That smile means you liked my joke, Boss.

564
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,640
That smile means you liked my joke, Boss.

565
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,720
I'm serious. You don't have to worry about

566
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,680
that Hojun guy not agreeing to the deal.

567
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Just let it go. Because today

568
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,480
I've done some serious research as well.

569
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,320
And it looks like I've found the right guy.

570
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,360
I'm talking about this guy.

571
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,920
He might not look
presentable in the photos.

572
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,040
But overall, he's pretty solid.

573
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Hey, Boss?

574
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,800
Well. Thank you for listening, Boss.

575
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Boss?

576
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,880
Hey.

577
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,200
I have no idea where you live.

578
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,920
Boss?

579
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,560
Here we go.

580
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,600
Just sit here for now, okay?

581
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,680
Easy now.

582
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Just sit

583
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,680
and wait for a bit, okay?

584
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,640
I'll be back.

585
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,680
Yuka, can you teach me
how to cure a hangover?

586
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,320
You have a hangover, Hill?
There are many ways to deal with it.

587
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,040
Then give me the quickest and easiest one.

588
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,400
I recommend ginger tea.
Sipping ginger tea or a soup

589
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,520
can help ease hangover symptoms.

590
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,880
Ginger tea.

591
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,600
One second.

592
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,760
Perfect, I have some.

593
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,760
That should do it.

594
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,600
Thanks a lot, Yuka.

595
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,360
No problem! I'll do anything
for you. Ganbatte ne!

596
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,600
Here you go, Boss.

597
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
Ginger tea. Careful, it's hot.

598
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,520
This is Yuka’s recipe.

599
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,960
She said it would help with your hangover.

600
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,600
It worked for me, at least.

601
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,240
You made this? Is it really drinkable?

602
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,280
Come on, Boss. It's just ginger tea.

603
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Careful, it’s hot.

604
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
How is it?

605
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,680
We’ll have to see

606
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,160
if it gives me a stomachache instead.

607
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,320
Ouch.

608
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,960
Even drunk, you're still
sharp with the jokes.

609
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,040
Please wait for a bit. I'll be back soon.

610
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,400
I'll take a quick shower and change.

611
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,840
Coming through.

612
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,080
Boss, you should rest here for the night.

613
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,680
It’ll be morning in a few hours anyway.

614
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,120
Okay.

615
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,320
Wait.

616
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,560
I mean, you should sleep on the bed.

617
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,200
Why? I can take the floor.

618
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,000
No, you can't do that.

619
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,280
No, you can't do that.

620
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,400
Because this bed sheet
has Yuka-chan all over it.

621
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,520
Only I can sleep on it.

622
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,200
Really?

623
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,600
Even the bed sheet has Yuka-chan on it.

624
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,040
I see. I get it.

625
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,880
Here you go, Boss.

626
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,160
Just lie down here.

627
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,720
Okay.

628
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,600
Thanks.

629
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,280
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

630
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,520
I see.

631
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,960
You go first.

632
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I wanted to apologize, Boss.

633
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,560
I don't think Hojun will agree

634
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,360
to be our reference anymore.

635
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,720
I think I messed it up.

636
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
There's no need.

637
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,800
I should be thanking you for saving me.

638
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,960
I’m sorry…

639
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,800
for being so difficult.

640
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,960
And making everyone’s job harder.

641
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:08,560
I believe that if we end up with
the wrong person, it could ruin

642
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,200
what everyone has worked so hard on.

643
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
Hey.

644
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:31,080
I want to see everyone succeed
and be happy doing the work we love.

645
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,000
I want us to be a team

646
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,080
that walks hand in hand

647
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,480
and succeeds together.

648
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,360
We'll succeed, for sure. And your dream

649
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,720
will definitely come true.

650
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,080
I’ll help.

651
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,000
Rise and shine! You have work today, Hill.

652
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,080
Time to wake up and get ready for work.

653
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,880
Morning, Yuka.

654
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,360
Boss.

655
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,880
Oh, it's in Japanese.

656
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,160
Thanks for last night. Don’t be late.

657
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,040
Team, I have good news to share with you.

658
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,560
We've got our game's character reference!

659
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
[cheers and applause]

660
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,080
And that person is

661
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,440
Ho-jun, famous artist
with millions of followers!

662
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,000
Exciting, right? He confirmed
with me this morning

663
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,520
that he’s on board with the project.

664
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,840
Well, I just turned him down.

665
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,320
But why?

666
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,320
He's a superstar artist

667
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,000
and everyone’s been after him.

668
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,200
and everyone’s been after him.

669
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,640
I’ve already found the perfect guy
to be the reference for our game.

670
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,480
But Gotji's got nothing on Hojun.

671
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,640
I'm not talking about him.

672
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,080
Then who are you talking about?

673
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,320
Hear me out.

674
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,880
Who has all the right qualifications?

675
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,880
Who has no scandals,

676
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
a strong presence,

677
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,960
and is reliable,

678
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,080
determined,

679
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,760
and perfect in every way?

680
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,280
A talented person with fame,

681
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,040
proven trustworthy,

682
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,240
and a kind heart that all of us can feel.

683
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,720
That person is right here with us.

684
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,000
Wait, don't tell me—

685
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,040
Wait, don't tell me—

686
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,720
And that person is…

687
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,040
Our very own boss, Junji-san!

688
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:17,600
What?

689
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,760
Think about it, guys.

690
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,760
If users log into the game

691
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,600
and meet someone as perfect as him.

692
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,480
How happy would they be?

693
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Our Boss is

694
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,960
the perfect guy to be
our game's character reference.

695
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,320
Sorry but I can't.
I don't think I'm ready.

696
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,440
Boss, Japan is pressing us again.

697
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,000
We don’t have much time left.

698
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,240
We don’t have much time left.

699
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Well…

700
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,600
Fine.

701
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:23,600
[applause and cheers]

702
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,640
Alright! Our next step is to charm Boss
who's our game's reference material.

703
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,920
We want it to feel real,

704
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,840
it’s got to be you,

705
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,680
no doubt about it.

706
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,320
You.

707
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,200
Boss.

708
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Let me woo you.

709
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,280
This date

710
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,760
is going to be a success.

711
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,760
Boss.

712
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,920
So cool.

713
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,760
Thanks.

714
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
So where did you go?

715
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,960
Don't tell me

716
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,120
you wore Thai costumes to Wat Arun,

717
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,960
and hit Khaosan road in school uniforms.

718
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,840
With the time we’ve got left,

719
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,160
I just want to be with you

720
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
and making you happy.

721
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,320
Goodnight.
