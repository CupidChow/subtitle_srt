1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,400
Let's say we had to create

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,720
a male version of Yuka,

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,160
what kind of person
should our reference be?

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,800
They should be kind

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,440
and determined.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,840
Someone you can rely on
when things go wrong.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,680
I’ll have a lot of options
for you to choose from.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,840
Rejected.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,480
The right one always
shows up at the right time.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,520
And that person is

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,280
our very own boss.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,400
Boss, let me woo you.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,000
Everyone, gather up.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,560
Meeting time!

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Hurry up!

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,880
Today,

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,760
we have our first mission level,

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,520
designed by our Level Designer.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,120
This mission needs someone
to successfully carry it out

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,520
so we can use that data to build
a future male dating sim model.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,680
The person who will take on this mission

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
is…

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,640
Hill!

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Applause!

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,120
Louder!

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Pao, don't need to be
so dramatic. I’m embarrassed.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,200
How can I not be? The mission is important.

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,880
Hill will represent the player
in conquering the target,

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,720
and our target is

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,880
Our boss, Junji-san.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,000
The goal is to make a strong impression

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
so that the target…

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,000
accepts a friend request on social media.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
I see that.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
You're smiling.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,160
You think this is easy,
but the hard part starts now.

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Because up until now,
he has never used any social media,

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Because up until now,
he has never used any social media,

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,640
except for his private LINE account.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,240
And if you think that’s tough,
here’s something even harder.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,280
Boss has never given

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,320
his personal LINE ID to any employee.

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,200
Not a single one.

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,320
But you are going to be
the first to pull it off.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
A round of applause!

47
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,560
Wait! One more important thing,

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,600
This mission must be kept secret from Boss.

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,480
Questions?

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,640
Yeah.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
How exactly should I win him over?

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,320
How to win Boss over?

53
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,480
Yup.

54
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,680
I can…

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
I cannot help you, man.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,760
I trust you.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,320
Go all out.

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,280
Pao.

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Feeling happy?

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,480
It's nothing, Boss.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,840
Spill it, or I'll cut your bonus by 50%

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,520
I’ll tell you! Please stay calm, Boss.

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
Well…

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,800
You see…

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,040
You're the reference
for the new game, right?

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
And what does that have to do
with your smiling at me?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,320
And what does that have to do
with your smiling at me?

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,200
Oh, you know…

69
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,560
I heard whoever gets chosen
will be one people try to romance.

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,520
The idea gives me butterflies.
I want to be in your shoes, Boss.

71
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,960
That's enough. Get back to work.

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,960
No daydreaming.

73
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,680
Boss, let me woo you.

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
Man…

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,000
What do I do now? I already agreed to it.

76
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
Boss.

77
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,120
The Level Design team has completed

78
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,280
the first Mission Level.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I’ve also told Hill to get himself ready.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
I’ve also told Hill to get himself ready.

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
Good. So what’s the first mission like?

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,440
And what do I need to prepare?

83
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,880
You don’t have to prepare anything, Boss.

84
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
Just keep your schedule open and relax.

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Let's do it. For the project.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
I got this.

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,880
Easy creamy tom yum recipe,
flavorful but not too spicy.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,520
I think this recipe is suitable,
since you can't handle spicy food.

89
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,760
Thanks a lot, Yuka.

90
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,280
You’re always finding recipes for me.

91
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,880
You think you can find
a recipe to get a guy for me?

92
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,680
I have no recipes to get a guy,
just the ones to get my heart.

93
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Really? What am I going to do

94
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,720
I’ve never flirted with anyone in my life.

95
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,880
I couldn't get girls,

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,600
and now I have to get a guy?

97
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
How's that going to work?

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

99
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,560
You're amazing, Hill. You can do this!

100
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,920
Ganbatte ne! (You got this!)

101
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,240
Thanks, Yuka.

102
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,480
But seriously, I can't see
any path to succees this time.

103
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
You can do it! You got accepted into
your dream university, remember?

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can do it! You got accepted into
your dream university, remember?

105
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
You’re right, Yuka.

106
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,440
I’ve handled tougher things before.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Alright, let’s go!

108
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
Even if this time I have to
win over a guy like Boss.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,880
I know he's tough, but I won't give up!

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,280
Ganbatte ne ! (I got this!)

111
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,400
I’m so proud of you, Hill.

112
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
You’re the coolest. You’re so amazing!

113
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,440
I’ve finished it, Yuka-chan.

114
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,120
Easy, creamy tom yum recipe,
flavorful but not too spicy.

115
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,840
Let’s try it and see how it turned out.

116
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,640
Oww!

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,480
Oww!

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Whoa!

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
Yuka, why is it so spicy?

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,800
It's hot, too!

121
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,680
"How to Get the Guy, Fast and Flawless"

122
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,080
This probably won’t work.

123
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,680
Wait, what about this one?

124
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,280
Repeat the same words to build
a connection that's more than friendship.

125
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,600
Can’t use that either.

126
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm trying to win over Boss, not a friend.

127
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,800
Figured out how to win
my heart yet, Handsome Hill?

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,000
Whoa!

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,440
Whoa!

130
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,320
Aha!

131
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
You freaked out.

132
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,760
Jeez, What are you doing? You scared me!

133
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm super stressed out.

134
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,160
You’re going to flirt with a guy and
you're this stressed out? That's not good.

135
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,840
Work should be fun,
only then will it turn out well.

136
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
I want to have fun,

137
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,680
but I’m totally blanking.

138
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
Flirting is new to me.

139
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,800
And with guy? I can't even imagine how.

140
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,560
The first mission's already a mess, huh?

141
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,200
Come on, Hill.

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
Getting guys or girls, it's all the same.

143
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,200
Not that hard.

144
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,280
Sheesh.

145
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,560
Here.

146
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,400
Good luck, bro!

147
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,560
What?

148
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh well.

149
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
Boss.

150
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,240
Boss.

151
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,160
How am I supposed to win you over?

152
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
Damn.

153
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,560
Ugh.

154
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,160
What the heck?

155
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,040
Professor Bay!

156
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,120
Now you’re calling me professor?

157
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,640
Since you’re an expert
with female dating sim—

158
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,160
So?

159
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,280
Please teach me how to get a guy.

160
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Nope.

161
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
That's your mission.

162
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,840
You must handle it yourself.

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Go on,

164
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
I’m not helping.

165
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,520
Professor! Please help!

166
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm such a sucker for drama. Fine, get up.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm such a sucker for drama. Fine, get up.

168
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,400
I’ll give you one simple tip.

169
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,920
If you want to win someone over,
you need to get to their heart.

170
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,800
Right.

171
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,560
What do you know about him?

172
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,200
He…

173
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,040
You took too long.

174
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Let's start simple.

175
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,480
The dish he likes.

176
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,080
Yeah.

177
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
His go-to drinks.

178
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Places he likes.

179
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,720
That stuff.

180
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,520
Any idea?

181
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,760
I've got it.

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
I've seen the light.

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,200
Since you’ve worked with Boss for so long,

184
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,000
you must know all his likes and dislikes.

185
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,520
Please share with me, just a little?

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,560
Alright, you want to know?

187
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,200
Okay. Can you guess what Thai dish—

188
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,400
Thai dish.

189
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,080
Boss likes the most?

190
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,560
Okay.

191
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,200
Go.

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,400
- Okay.
- Here's a hint.

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
It’s a curry.

194
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,600
You got it wrong,

195
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
you’ll get punished.

196
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,880
Got it?

197
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Got it.

198
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,720
If you’re ready, start guessing.

199
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Curry.

200
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Curry.

201
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Sour curry.

202
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,040
Nope.

203
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,800
Eggplant curry.

204
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,240
No.

205
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
Chicken? Bamboo Shoot?

206
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
Massaman.

207
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,000
Cassia curry.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,360
No.

209
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,240
Fermented Fish Entails.

210
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,200
Spicy Veggie Curry.

211
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,320
Pork curry.

212
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,600
Frog curry.

213
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,360
Curry.

214
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Curry.

215
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
- That's it. Time's up.
- Curry—

216
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,160
None of them were right, Hill.

217
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,320
Seriously?! I listed every curry I know.

218
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,320
Not all of them.

219
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,640
His favorite curry

220
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
is green curry, Hill.

221
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Green curry!

222
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,720
How could I forget that? Green curry!

223
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,240
Green curry is the most
popular among foreigners.

224
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,800
And Boss is a foreigner.
That info isn’t even hard to find!

225
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,160
Agh!

226
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, where are you going?

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
Hey, where are you going?

228
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,320
To research, like you said.

229
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
Yeah, but go later.

230
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,280
Since you guessed wrong,
you need to be punished.

231
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,000
- Punishment.
- Yup!

232
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,520
What is it?

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,800
Dance for me.

234
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,040
- What?
- Dance.

235
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,240
- Dance?
- Yeah, dance.

236
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,120
- Oink, oink!
- Look. He's crawling like a pig!

237
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,800
- Oink, oink!
- Wow, how can you get that fat.

238
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,720
Oink, oink!

239
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,680
Oink, oink!

240
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
Just dance already, Hill.

241
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't dance.

242
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,720
Can I just treat you to a meal?

243
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,600
No, you must dance.

244
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,400
If you don’t, I won’t help you romance Boss.

245
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,840
Do it. Now.

246
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,080
No, I'm not dancing.

247
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
Just dance, Hill.

248
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,040
No.

249
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,640
Dance.

250
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,880
Should I get everyone
to come and watch?

251
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,880
Seriously, I can't.

252
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,000
You can.

253
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,440
You can.

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Can't do a simple move this this?

255
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
But that's totally a club dance move, Bay.

256
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
I can't do that.

257
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,360
Yes, you can. Watch and learn.

258
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,240
If you don’t dance, I’m not helping you.

259
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,880
Watch.

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
Watch carefully.

261
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,000
Damn. It's Boss.

262
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,160
I'm so screwed.

263
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,480
Where did you go, Hill?

264
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,240
Well, host club professor Bay?

265
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,760
Will you get sacked?

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,840
Jeez, you returned so quickly.

267
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,840
Do you still want me to dance?

268
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,800
Can you show me the move again? I forgot.

269
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,920
If I dance again, I’ll really get fired.

270
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,560
Just buy me a meal instead.

271
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,000
Alright.

272
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
Then hurry up and give me
some tips on how to flirt with Boss.

273
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,120
You didn't dance

274
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,320
but still want my advice?

275
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,280
- Yup.
- Jeez.

276
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
Fine, whatever.

277
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,840
I’ve been with him for so long

278
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,600
I know everything about him.

279
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
I do have a way to help you
complete your mission.

280
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,760
What is it?

281
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,800
Just take Boss to a bar and get him drunk.

282
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,080
Once he's drunk, he'll give you everything.

283
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,320
Trust a playboy like me.

284
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
How’s that?

285
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,920
Boss.

286
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,080
- Boss, come here.
- Hey!

287
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,160
I don’t think this is going to work.

288
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,000
Suit yourself.

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,960
Suit yourself.

290
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm heading back.

291
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,600
Ugh.

292
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,400
Let’s dance! Come on, dance!

293
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,240
It’ll help relieve your stress, Hill.

294
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,480
Sometimes dancing can cause stress, Yuka.

295
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,360
Seems like you still haven’t figured out
how to clear the first mission, huh?

296
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah.

297
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,680
I think maybe you should try
inviting Boss out on a little trip.

298
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,680
A trip?

299
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,560
Yes! Based on the data, foreigners
enjoy visiting beautiful temples

300
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,200
and trying delicious food.
Boss might be impressed by these things.

301
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,080
That’s what Bay told me.
We need to do our homework.

302
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,800
Temples and Thai food.

303
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
For the first date, making a strong impression is key.

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,920
For the first date, making a strong impression is key.

305
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,360
During the day,
I'll take him to beautiful places.

306
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,880
In the evening, I'll take him

307
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,600
on a luxurious dinner cruise
along Chao Phraya River.

308
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,440
Once the boss is impressed,

309
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,400
I’ll ask for his LINE.

310
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,040
So romantic!

311
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,160
I hope it goes well.

312
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,720
Ganbatte ne! (You got this!)

313
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course, Yuka.

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,640
This date

315
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,440
is going to be a success.

316
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
Thanks a lot.

317
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Whoa. Boss, you look
absolutely amazing in Thai costume.

318
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,760
Kakkoii. (So cool)

319
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,560
Thanks.

320
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,480
Boss, what are you doing?
We’re at a temple.

321
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
Your sash was loose.

322
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,720
Let me.

323
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,680
You even know how to wrap a sash?

324
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,680
I’m Thai and I still can’t do it.

325
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,800
There.

326
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,000
Thank you, Boss.

327
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,040
The tattoo shop’s over there,
if you happen to want one.

328
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,720
The massage parlor is back there.

329
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,400
Hey.

330
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,480
Fancy a Thai massage?

331
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,640
Here is a Pad Thai stall, Boss.

332
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,000
This is our national dish, Pad Thai.

333
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,720
Want to give it a try?
I can tell you're hungry.

334
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,320
Ma'am, one plate of Pad Thai
with these noodles please.

335
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
I guarantee you will love it.

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
I guarantee you will love it.

337
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,560
I’ll help.

338
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,960
Thank you.

339
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,640
Boss.

340
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,280
Wait, Boss. You know how to make Pad Thai?

341
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,400
Whoa, Boss!

342
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,160
Boss.

343
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,240
Wow!

344
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,520
Alright.

345
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,400
Whoa, Boss.

346
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,600
Delicious!

347
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,040
Sugoi! (Amazing) Oishii! (Delicious)

348
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,480
Oishii! (Delicious)

349
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
Here, have some.

350
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,760
It's really good.

351
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
So tasty.

352
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,800
Boss, this place is called
“Silver-Gold Table.”

353
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,600
It's guaranteed that visitors who dine here

354
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,720
will always find their way back.

355
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,000
Just like their slogan,

356
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
Just like their slogan,

357
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,360
"delicious, intense, and unforgettable
only at Silver-Gold Table!"

358
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,040
And the one menu item
that guarantees you'll be hooked is—

359
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,280
Mr. Junji, what would you like to order?

360
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,200
Well…

361
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,520
Anything specific that you'd like, Boss?

362
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,760
Well…

363
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,920
You choose. I eat everything.

364
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,560
Got it. Then, one green curry.

365
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,360
And then…

366
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,720
One tom yum goong,

367
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,480
one spicy minced pork,
and a papaya salad.

368
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,240
How many chillies for papaya salad?

369
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,400
Let's go with two, not too spicy.

370
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm afraid it'll be too spicy for you, Boss.

371
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,360
Ten chillies.

372
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,760
Ten? Boss, that's really spicy.

373
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Ten chillies.

374
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,280
Fine, ten it is.

375
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,680
So we've been to a lot of places today.

376
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,600
I had a great time. Did you enjoy it too?

377
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,120
Is there anywhere else
you’d like to go? Tell me

378
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
and I'll be your guide.

379
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,680
You only need to send me a LINE message.

380
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,200
We took tons of photos today, too.

381
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,520
I’ll send them as soon as
I upload them from my camera.

382
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
So, can I have your…

383
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,160
LINE?

384
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,000
Yes, Boss.

385
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,320
Yes, Boss.

386
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,440
I’ll scan your QR code then.

387
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,040
I changed my mind.

388
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,320
Just upload them to the office iCloud.

389
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,600
Okay.

390
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,160
Try the papaya salad,
it’s just as famous as the green curry.

391
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,800
Take it easy, okay? Looks spicy.

392
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,440
Slowly now.

393
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,920
Yeah.

394
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,600
It's good.

395
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,920
- It’s not too spicy, Boss?
- No.

396
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Maybe the chilies here aren't that hot?

397
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,880
You try it. It’s really good.

398
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,760
So good it’ll knock you out, huh Boss?

399
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,080
Oww!

400
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,640
Damn.

401
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,600
Boss!

402
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,480
Whoa.

403
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,520
Boss.

404
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,800
How can you eat that? It’s so spicy!

405
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,200
Why wouldn’t he be able to eat it?

406
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,240
Papaya salad with ten chilies
is Junji’s favorite dish,

407
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,560
right after the green curry.

408
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,480
He visits so often,
this place is his regular spot.

409
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
So, where have you two been today?

410
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,760
So, where have you two been today?

411
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,920
Did you wear Thai costumes to Wat Arun,
hit Khaosan road in school uniforms,

412
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,160
and now you're finishing it off
with a meal at my Silver-Gold Table?

413
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,840
Hang on.

414
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,320
Are you a fortune teller?

415
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,920
How did you know?

416
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,800
Of course he knows.

417
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Phat is a close friend of mine.

418
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,000
He owns this place.

419
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,760
And this is Hill. He works at the company.

420
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,760
Hello, Mr. Hill.

421
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,360
Hello.

422
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,640
Junji usually brings groups of CEOs

423
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,960
and Japanese friends around like this.

424
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,520
Must’ve been ten times already.

425
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,120
So I guess,

426
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,240
taking him on a Chao Phraya dinner cruise

427
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,760
would be pointless.

428
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
He’s probably done that too.

429
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,760
Don’t think so. Right, Junji?

430
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,720
Right.

431
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,520
Really, Boss?

432
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,560
You haven’t?

433
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,280
Okay then!

434
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I’ll take my leave.

435
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,680
- It’s really good.
- Thank you.

436
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,640
Boss, how can you even eat that? Whoa!

437
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
Excuse me.

438
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,200
Has the 5 p.m. boat already left?

439
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,560
It just left. Just now.

440
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,680
So, we missed it?

441
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,840
That's right.

442
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,840
Okay.

443
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,520
Thank you.

444
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,240
Boss.

445
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,920
Well…

446
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,880
The staff said the boat had just left.

447
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,480
So…

448
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,400
We…

449
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
In other words, we missed the last boat.

450
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,360
In other words, we missed the last boat.

451
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,520
Today probably wasn’t much fun for you.

452
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,120
I ended up taking you to
all the places you’ve been before.

453
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,280
But if there's anywhere you want to go,

454
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,160
just tell me and I'll take you there.

455
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,200
Up to you. We still have time.

456
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,560
Then…

457
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,600
Where to?

458
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
Why is dating so hard?

459
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,440
So where are you taking me next?

460
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
Where?

461
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,920
I…

462
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,760
Why don’t you take me somewhere you like?

463
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,320
The place I like.

464
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,120
The place I like!

465
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,880
I’ve got it, Boss!

466
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,040
There’s this place,

467
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,360
you’ll love it.

468
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
This way, please.

469
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,200
Let's go.

470
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,480
Legend Heroes Game? This is what makes you happy?

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,800
Exactly, Boss.

472
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,240
This is like heaven to me.

473
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,880
Back in university,
I came here all the time after class.

474
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,520
What do you say we battle it out in a game?

475
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,760
Did you forget that I'm the boss
of PRISMSTAR Thailand.

476
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,480
Ready to get crushed? Game on.

477
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Alright.

478
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
That’s what I’m talking about.

479
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,280
That’s what I’m talking about.

480
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
Go ahead, pick the game

481
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,600
you want to duel me in.

482
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay.

483
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,160
Oh no!

484
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,200
Boss, you’re no joke!

485
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,560
Of course. Your turn.

486
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,680
Alright, Boss!

487
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,520
Okay, I give up.

488
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,240
A real gamer like you

489
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
must be good at this.

490
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
Then let’s change the game, Boss.

491
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,760
That one over there.

492
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,000
I think it'll suit you better.

493
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,040
I think it'll suit you better.

494
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,440
Let’s go again, Boss.

495
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,040
Yeah!

496
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,360
Boss, it’s your turn.

497
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,760
I'm pretty sure I’m losing this one.

498
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,640
Yeah?

499
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,520
Why do you think I’ll win?

500
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Well, baseball kind of a standard
sport for boys in Japan, right?

501
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,000
And I bet you’re really good at it.

502
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
Wrong. I don’t know how to play at all.

503
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,720
Really? How come?

504
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,920
Back then, I'd hide in the computer
room every time we had baseball.

505
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,800
I see.

506
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,080
Then, we can change to
another game if you want.

507
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,120
It’s fine. Let’s play baseball.

508
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
Watching you made it look fun.

509
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
Watching you made it look fun.

510
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,560
I want to try.

511
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,480
Is that what you want?

512
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,720
Alright.

513
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,760
Let’s give it a go.

514
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,680
I’ll press the button for you.

515
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,240
Watch out, Boss.

516
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
One more, Boss.

517
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,000
Actually, hold on.

518
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,600
Here. Excuse me.

519
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,880
I think you should move your hand here.

520
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,600
- Now grip it tightly.
- Okay.

521
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Wait a moment.

522
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,440
Sorry. But if you grip it tight like this…

523
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,840
You seem really excited.
You really don’t play much, huh?

524
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,000
- Yeah, never have.
- Alright.

525
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
- Yeah, never have.
- Alright.

526
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,320
Here.

527
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,880
So when you grip like this,

528
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,440
keep your eyes on the pitcher.

529
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
When they throw,

530
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,440
do this.

531
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,800
Whack!

532
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,120
Try it. Give it everything you’ve got.

533
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
- Give it everything?
- Yes.

534
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,000
Nice!

535
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,160
Much better!

536
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,120
One more time!

537
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,800
Wow!

538
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,040
It's a home run, Boss!

539
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,480
Amazing!

540
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,200
Boss, it's urgent. Can you
come back to the office?

541
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,800
Right now?

542
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,000
Japan sent over a request
and they want it done tonight.

543
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
Japan sent over a request
and they want it done tonight.

544
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,880
Okay, I’ll head back immediately.

545
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,800
Going to take care of something?

546
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,480
Yeah, I need to get to the office.
You can keep playing if you want.

547
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,000
Thanks for showing me around.

548
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,600
Here. I’ll get going now.

549
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,040
Alright.

550
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,240
Ugh. It's over.

551
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,600
And I still didn’t get his LINE.

552
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,600
Got it.

553
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,480
I’m hurrying to finish it.

554
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,160
Yes.

555
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,360
I’ll send it in tonight.

556
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,480
Wait, you didn’t stay and continue to play?

557
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,200
Why are you at the office?
Did you forget something?

558
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,640
I didn’t forget anything.

559
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,760
But there’s still a bit of
time left on our date.

560
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,920
I decided

561
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,200
I want to spend the time we have,

562
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,680
to be with you and make you happy.

563
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,600
I’m already happy today.

564
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,120
Thanks for taking me on that 'repeat' trip.

565
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,840
Too bad I’ve got work to finish tonight.

566
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,040
Doesn’t leave much time for romancing.

567
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,640
If I can't do any romancing,

568
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,040
can I at least stay and keep you company?

569
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,200
If you'd like I can stay as
someone who's more than friend?

570
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,800
Good at flirting and jokes, huh?

571
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,600
There's no need.

572
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,200
Thanks anyway.

573
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,240
In case you need anything,
I want to take care of you.

574
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,840
I can take care of myself.

575
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,040
But I’m worried you’ll get hungry.

576
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,040
Please? Let me stay with you.

577
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,080
Alright. You can stay.

578
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,920
But only if you promise to keep me awake.

579
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,800
I promise.

580
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,240
I’ll keep you awake, Boss.

581
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,160
Then make me feel awake.

582
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,320
Right now.

583
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,920
Got it.

584
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,760
How about we start with some coffee?

585
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,600
No thanks. I’d rather not drink coffee.

586
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,120
If not coffee, what would you like?

587
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,080
I’ll get you anything

588
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Well.

589
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,960
I want to see you dance.

590
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,000
What?

591
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,640
Dance?

592
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,360
Dance to help me stay awake.

593
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,240
Didn't you

594
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,520
learn to dance with Bay?

595
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,320
You promised, Hill.

596
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Ganbatte ne! (You got this!)

597
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Ganbatte ne! (I got this!)

598
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,040
Okay. Just for you.

599
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
Do you feel awake now?

600
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,000
Hmm.

601
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,360
Feeling awake?

602
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,400
Not yet.

603
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
- Still?
- Nope.

604
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,400
Who dances like that?

605
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,400
Boss, how about you take a break?

606
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,000
Almost done. I’ll take that coffee then.

607
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,200
Almost done. I’ll take that coffee then.

608
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,400
Coming right up. Just a moment.

609
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,160
Here’s your coffee, Boss.

610
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,920
Here.

611
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,480
Here you go.

612
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,520
Boss, you see…

613
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,320
I was wondering if maybe
I could have your LINE ID?

614
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,240
So when you're super busy,
I could send work through LINE.

615
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,640
I don't have to bother you like this.

616
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,200
But if that's not okay,
that's totally fine. I understand.

617
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,280
Boss.

618
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,560
Boss?

619
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,800
Boss!

620
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,240
Damn it.

621
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,440
Again?

622
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,360
Making me talk to myself this whole time.

623
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,200
You really are dedicated to your work.

624
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,480
Even willing to die in the line of duty.

625
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,680
Boss.

626
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,520
Good night.

627
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,640
Curled up like a little worm.

628
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,560
Mission failed. It was a total disaster.

629
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,160
I have an inspirational quote to lift your spirits, Hill.

630
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,120
Fall, but don’t lose hope.
Rest, but don’t despair.

631
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,400
Ganbatte ne! (You got this!)

632
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,720
You’ve got quotes now, Yuka-chan?

633
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,080
Thanks.

634
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,320
You know what?

635
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,000
Even though I failed the mission,

636
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
Even though I failed the mission,

637
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,560
it wasn’t all that bad, Yuka-chan.

638
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,120
There were some good moments.

639
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,320
That's Boss.

640
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,040
What?

641
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,280
Boss!

642
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,000
I did it!

643
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,320
I did it!

644
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,720
Hey! Yuka!

645
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,400
I completed the mission, Yuka!

646
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,120
I did it! Yay!

647
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,200
I really did it!

648
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,760
Yuka!

649
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,440
It’s all thanks to you!

650
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,160
I made it!

651
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,520
Congratulations, Hill.

652
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
I'm so proud of you.

653
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,400
- You're the best, the coolest.
- How should I reply?

654
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,000
Well…

655
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,080
How…

656
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,800
Let’s all congratulate Hill for
completing the first mission beautifully.

657
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,720
He successfully got Boss to accept
his friend request on LINE. Applause!

658
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,800
Louder!

659
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,800
Pao, you're being over the top.

660
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,040
Stop. I’m embarrassed.

661
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,440
- Embarrassed, huh?
- Yeah.

662
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,520
Let’s move right along
to the second mission!

663
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,240
Hold on.

664
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,000
Are you seriously not
going to give me a break?

665
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,840
Are you seriously not
going to give me a break?

666
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Break? We’re all working here.

667
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,480
For the second mission

668
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,920
Hill, you have to hold his…

669
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,000
To hold…

670
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,360
To hold…

671
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,120
His hand.

672
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,160
Hold hands.

673
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,520
That's right.

674
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,000
Guys, this is important.

675
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,440
Boss must not find out,
under any circumstances.

676
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,600
Got it.

677
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,520
Back to work, everyone.

678
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,720
Boss might come.

679
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,440
Move it.

680
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,600
I trust you.

681
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:27,960
Yuka-chan.

682
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,040
What do you have to do

683
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,520
to hold hands with someone?

684
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,320
I have an important job for you,

685
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,200
research and flirt with this guy.

686
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,240
Then, may I woo you, Mr. Phat?

687
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,840
Everyone,

688
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,760
this is Ms. Jeans.

689
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,200
What do you think of him, Jun-chan?

690
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Do you like Hill?
