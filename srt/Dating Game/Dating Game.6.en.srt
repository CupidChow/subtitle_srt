1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,080
What if I said I have

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,360
changed my mind?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,160
About being your reference material.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,080
I'll do it.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,360
You found out Jeans’s secret, didn’t you?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,480
And how do you feel?

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,200
In the end,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,040
you couldn’t lie to your feelings, right?

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,320
Now that’s the shot.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,960
Looks cool.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,720
Moments like this

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,640
is the cutest.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Excuse me!

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,160
To Chong Nonsi junction.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,880
Alright.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm running late, Yuka.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,840
Got a shortcut?

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,680
In 500 meters, turn right

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,520
to a narrow alley up ahead.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,840
Okay, Yuka.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,360
If I make it

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,880
I'll give you flowers or

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,560
a new house.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,320
Whoa!

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,080
Kid.

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,240
Your girl really

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,000
scored big with you.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,360
scored big with you.

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,200
Of course.

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,480
Put the helmet on.

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,680
- Let's hurry.
- I got you!

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,400
Okay!

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
- Let's go!
- Alright.

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
- Go, go, go!
- Off we go!

35
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,680
Hey.

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,000
You're almost here?

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, hurry up.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,520
See you.

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
Is Hill at the office?

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,880
What did he say?

41
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,680
[everyone] - What did he say?
- When will he be here?

42
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
Come on,

43
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,840
Chill.

44
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,080
All of you fangirls

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,240
just wait for him.

46
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,120
He’s on his way.

47
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,280
Did Hill complete the mission?

48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,680
Did Boss hold hands with him?

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,720
[everyone] - Did Boss let him?
- Did they hold hands?

50
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,560
Jeez…

51
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,240
I don't know.

52
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,440
Better let him tell you.

53
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,560
Hill won't spill a thing.

54
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,640
But I Hill was thrilled and

55
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,680
totally pulled it off.

56
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,840
Hello? Hill?

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,960
Where are you?

58
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,160
Dude, hurry to the office.

59
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Your fangirls here

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,520
are waiting for you.

61
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Saying,

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,080
"Hill this, Hill that."

63
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,680
Where you at?

64
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh.

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,760
Oh.

66
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Jeans?

67
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Hi, Jeans.

68
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,360
What's up?

69
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,680
Ah.

70
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,280
What?!

71
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,160
Seriously?

72
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,280
Send it to me, please.

73
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,960
Yeah.

74
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,480
Okay, okay.

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,640
[excited squeal]

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,000
Aw.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,520
Aw.

79
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,200
So cute.

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,560
Wish I could experience something like it.

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
So cute.

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,560
[clears throat]

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,800
All unrelated personnel,

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
please step out of the meeting.

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Because the Level Designers

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,240
will continue the meeting.

87
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,680
I really can’t wait for the next mission.

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
Pao.

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,360
Just give Hill his next mission already.

90
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,320
Please, I'm dying to the swoon over them.

91
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,280
Swoon?

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
Dying to swoon!?

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,000
Go swoon outside.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,960
This is a meeting.

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
Unrelated personnel,

96
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,680
please leave.

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
Ugh.

98
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,120
You'll regret this.

99
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,480
[squeals]

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,760
Hill!

101
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,360
How does holding hands with Boss feel?

102
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Well.

103
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,600
It was—

104
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Aw.

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,920
Look at you, all tongue-tied.

106
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,200
That's adorable. It’s fine, dear.

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's take a photo.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's take a photo.

109
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
[chaotic chatter] Me too!

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
Seriously?

111
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,080
"Me too."

112
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,560
"Let's take a pho—"

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,800
What are you doing?

114
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
Taking a photo of him?

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
Why him? He’s famous.

116
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,080
What about me?

117
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,360
You?

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,840
We'll take one together.

119
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,560
[squeals]

120
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,640
Hill!

121
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,720
Hey, Hill!

122
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
You’re so cute.

123
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,920
We’ve always been cheering on you.

124
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,320
[squeals]

125
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,120
Damn it.

126
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,320
- Forget the meeting.
- Okay.

127
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,080
Sheesh.

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,480
[fangirls chattering]

129
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
Make some noise!

130
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,480
So,

131
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,360
this means I passed Mission Two, right?

132
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,440
Right.

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
You did great.

134
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,000
Awesome.

135
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,400
Awesome how?

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I wasn't the one who initiated it.

137
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,000
So?

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
Even if you weren't

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,360
the one who initiated it,

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
you still made him

141
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,800
grab your hands.

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
That counts?

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,080
Sure does.

144
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Listen up, everyone.

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
This game

146
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,560
will feel fresh

147
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,720
and unlike any other.

148
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
It’s all about realism

149
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,640
and unpredictability,

150
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,080
which

151
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,560
is the real charm.

152
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Alright, everyone.

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Since we’ve cleared Mission Two,

154
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
we’re moving on

155
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,920
to the final mission.

156
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,560
The hardest,

157
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,440
toughest,

158
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
and most brutal one.

159
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
For Mission Three:

160
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,000
Hill,

161
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,400
you have to

162
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,040
ask him to be

163
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
your boyfriend.

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
[clapping]

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,160
[clapping]

166
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,040
To make it realistic,

167
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,320
we’ve got this.

168
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
This is a sticker.

169
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,280
It'll track his heart rate

170
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,320
while

171
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,280
he’s on a date with Hill.

172
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,800
And we’re

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,240
going to stick it right on his chest.

174
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
So, I’m supposed to

175
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,640
put this sticker thing on

176
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,560
Junji-san’s chest?

177
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,120
Hill.

178
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,160
Hill.

179
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:39,880
Hill.

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,440
Hill.

181
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah?

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You don’t have to.

183
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,840
I’ll do it myself.

184
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,280
As for you,

185
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
since you’re late,

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,320
you’ll report the progress to him

187
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
instead of me.

188
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,240
Got it?

189
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,960
Yeah.

190
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,920
Good.

191
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,000
Everyone,

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,320
Everyone,

193
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,520
dismissed.

194
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,800
Wait!

195
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,640
Don’t tell Boss about this mission.

196
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Alright?

197
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,000
Make it count.

198
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Go on,

199
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,000
hurry up.

200
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,840
Boss.

201
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,080
Boss.

202
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,520
Boss!

203
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,040
Ah.

204
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,440
What is it, Hill?

205
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,680
Pao told me to give you an update

206
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
that I've completed

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Mission Two.

208
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,240
And I’m starting the next one.

209
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Congratulations, Hill.

210
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,920
Thank you,

211
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,680
Junji-san.

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
What for?

213
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,600
Because

214
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,080
I wouldn’t have cleared it

215
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,960
if that night you hadn’t

216
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,240
done that…

217
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Junji-san.

218
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
Will you be my boyfriend?

219
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,720
Well done.

220
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,280
Hill, you’re the best.

221
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,840
Ugh.

222
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,920
Saying it to mirror

223
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
might work just fine, Yuka.

224
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,480
But I wonder

225
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,440
when I'm telling him in person,

226
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,480
will I really say it?

227
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm not even sure if

228
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
I’ll complete the mission.

229
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Maybe you can’t say it because

230
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,280
you feel like you don’t really know him.

231
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,320
Am I right?

232
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
But I know you can do it.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,480
But I know you can do it.

234
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah.

235
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Alright.

236
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,640
Let’s keep practicing.

237
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
I love you.

238
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,160
I love you.

239
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,200
I really love you.

240
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,240
Let’s be a couple.

241
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,240
Junji-san.

242
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
I love you.

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,400
Perfect, Hill!

244
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,080
That one was perfect.

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,400
How about

246
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
saying it to the real thing?

247
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,320
Oh.

248
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,800
Really?

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
For real, Yuka?

250
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
Alright.

251
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,000
Junji-san.

252
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
I…

253
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,560
I…

254
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,520
Hill.

255
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,680
Ganbatte ne!

256
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,960
I…

257
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,400
If you like me,

258
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,120
just say it.

259
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,040
Oink,

260
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,000
like a pig.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,920
Oink, oink.

262
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,480
Oink, oink.

263
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Wow!

264
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,280
Dude, this would be a big hit.

265
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,720
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,520
Oink, oink.

267
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,760
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

268
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,880
- Oink, oink.
- You fatso.

269
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,280
It’s okay, Hill.

270
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,880
Ganbatte ne!

271
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,040
I know you’re struggling

272
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,480
because of your past.

273
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
You couldn't even

274
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,160
say it to me,

275
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,320
or ask me out.

276
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,360
We're a couple because

277
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,560
you completed your goal

278
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,240
for weight-loss.

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,640
And you even got into

280
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,920
your dream university.

281
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,760
[sighs]

282
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
You're right.

283
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,640
If I can't let go of

284
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,480
what Praewa did,

285
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,920
I'll never make it through this mission.

286
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
I won't have the guts

287
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,680
to ask Junji-san to be my boyfriend.

288
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,160
Don’t give up, Hill.

289
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,120
Hill.

290
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,880
Ganbatte ne!

291
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,080
[sighs]

292
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
After you.

293
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
Whoa…

294
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,600
Wait, wait, wait.

295
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,000
After you.

296
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,480
Here we go.

297
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,160
What's this?

298
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,360
Come on up.

299
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,960
You sure?

300
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,520
Yeah, just hop on.

301
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,240
There you go.

302
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,880
Whoa, wait a second.

303
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,360
So,

304
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,640
you ever ridden an ATV?

305
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,880
Nope, never.

306
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,400
Alright

307
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,280
So you twist this—

308
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,560
Okay.

309
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,640
to start, see?

310
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,280
Twist it here

311
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,240
so it looks like this.

312
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Got it.

313
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,480
And then,

314
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,880
the throttle's here.

315
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
I see

316
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,360
- Now we're all set.
- I see.

317
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
- Got it?
- Yup, I get it now.

318
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,040
Whoa!

319
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,360
Hold on tight!

320
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,160
Okay.

321
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,520
Can I?

322
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,360
Yeah, go for it.

323
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
Nice!

324
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,000
[clapping]

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,520
Phat.

326
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
Okay.

327
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,920
Try it.

328
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,640
Your stance?

329
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,800
Like this.

330
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,680
My fingers?

331
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,240
Here.

332
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,960
Point them.

333
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,440
like this.

334
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,240
"I Love You" pose.

335
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,640
Ew.

336
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,880
Here.

337
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,040
Your drink.

338
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,560
Thanks.

339
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,440
Let’s take a break.

340
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,680
You like it?

341
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,000
Mm-hm.

342
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
I’ve got some pictures to show you.

343
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,080
You look funny in this.

344
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,960
Look.

345
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,240
That’s nice.

346
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,280
Right?

347
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,680
This one’s really good.

348
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,320
And there's this one video of you…

349
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,400
You’re very good at this.

350
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Of course.

351
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,040
I’m basically

352
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,960
a genius.

353
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,280
No way.

354
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,320
I can do anything.

355
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,760
So,

356
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,200
can I

357
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,960
add you on LINE?

358
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
So I can send you these.

359
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,760
My LINE?

360
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,560
Yeah.

361
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,040
LINE.

362
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,680
Here.

363
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,320
Okay.

364
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,840
Added.

365
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,640
Yeah.

366
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,560
I sent you a message.

367
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,320
Okay.

368
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,880
I'll AirDrop

369
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,080
the photos and videos.

370
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,480
Huh?

371
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,360
Then what about LINE?

372
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:24,920
Well,

373
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,560
AirDrop’s faster, that's all.

374
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,920
I'll use LINE for chatting.

375
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,800
Oh my god.

376
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
This one’s pretty.

377
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,440
You like it?

378
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,320
Yup.

379
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,680
[sighs]

380
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Such nice weather.

381
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,000
Ugh.

382
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Ugh.

383
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,720
Next date will be nicer.

384
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,360
I promise

385
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,280
you’ll love it.

386
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,880
Sounds good?

387
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Thanks for

388
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
showing me around all these nice places.

389
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,880
Just seeing you happy

390
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
makes me happy.

391
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,520
Come on.

392
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,560
More photos?

393
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,440
Sure.

394
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,320
What’s with that?

395
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,080
Take one like

396
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm kissing the bridge.

397
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,440
Like this?

398
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,120
Yeah.

399
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,240
Alright, one, two…

400
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,080
Kiss the bridge again.

401
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,160
Carry the bridge.

402
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
Junji-san.

403
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,000
Will you...

404
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
If you want to be my boyfriend,

405
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you'll crawl

406
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
and oink like a pig for me to see!

407
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,120
No.

408
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,960
Oink, oink.

409
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,680
No.

410
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
Oink, oink.

411
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,760
No.

412
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Cute little piggy!

413
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
- No.
- Oink, oink.

414
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,360
- No.
- Oink, oink.

415
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,040
No.

416
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,840
Piggy!

417
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,240
- No.
- Oink, oink.

418
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
- No.
- Piggy!

419
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,480
No!

420
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,640
Bay.

421
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,120
I need your advice.

422
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,280
Not now, I can't do that here.

423
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,160
Why not?

424
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,000
I’m working.

425
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,200
So,

426
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,120
now you won’t even give me any advice?

427
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,920
Bay,

428
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,400
you used to go around like

429
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,320
the guru, the lady's man, the playboy—

430
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,000
Hill!

431
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,120
Hill!

432
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Keep it down.

433
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
If Phat hears that, I’m screwed.

434
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Right now he’s in such a good mood.

435
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,720
Help me,

436
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,920
or I’ll shout that you're…

437
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,840
- …checking out girls.
- Hill!

438
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,720
Hey, Hill.

439
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,240
Here for a meal?

440
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,280
He'll take your order.

441
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:15,840
Ah.

442
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
Sure,

443
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,000
thank you.

444
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,760
What now?

445
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,520
Will you help me?

446
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,560
Fine, I’ll help.

447
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,680
Out with it.

448
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,120
So,

449
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,520
the last mission is

450
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,080
to ask him to be my boyfriend.

451
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,560
I…

452
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,680
don't know where to start.

453
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,080
If you're asking someone out,

454
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
you should know their likes and dislikes.

455
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,280
And do you know

456
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,400
his likes and dislikes?

457
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,160
I only know the basics.

458
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,960
But if you want to win his heart,

459
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,920
you'll need

460
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,280
insights.

461
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,200
Insights?

462
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:53,960
Yeah.

463
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,240
How do I get that info?

464
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know.

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That’s your homework.

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,120
That’s your homework.

467
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
You find it.

468
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,280
Got it?

469
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,560
Right now, I’m working.

470
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,560
Okay?

471
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,120
Insights…

472
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,160
Thanks, man.

473
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,600
Sure.

474
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,960
Oh,

475
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,280
Junji-san as a kid.

476
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,720
Pretty cute.

477
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,920
And now? Am I not cute anymore?

478
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,560
Ah.

479
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
I see.

480
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,240
I'll take your silence

481
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,960
as a yes, then.

482
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,800
I think,

483
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,480
you still look cute.

484
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,880
Since

485
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,760
you're in my office,

486
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,600
I guess you're looking for me?

487
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh.

488
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,280
Yes.

489
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,240
Actually, I came here

490
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,120
to ask you out

491
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,840
on a date with me.

492
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,160
Sure.

493
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,800
I’ll have my secretary schedule it.

494
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
Thank you, Junji-san.

495
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
Wait.

496
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,040
Oops.

497
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,760
I forgot.

498
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,760
Old habits die hard.

499
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,040
Bay.

500
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,680
Bay, man.

501
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,160
What?

502
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,760
I've done my homework.

503
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,240
Got some insights from Junji-san.

504
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,200
Another time, I’m busy.

505
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,640
Hey

506
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,480
Wait!

507
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,120
What?

508
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,760
Where to?

509
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,720
Just

510
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,480
let go!

511
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,320
It's a mission.

512
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,240
A mission?

513
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,880
In a game?

514
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,480
I’ll help.

515
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,600
A real life one.

516
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
Phat gave me

517
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
this shopping list.

518
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,120
If I get it done in 30 minutes,

519
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
I'll get a prize.

520
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,280
Wait a second.

521
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,600
Wow.

522
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,880
You totally got played by him.

523
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,960
It's impossible.

524
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,560
- I can.
- Yup.

525
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
You won't be able to.

526
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,400
Hmph.

527
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Everyone,

528
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,480
let's go!

529
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,200
Hey.

530
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,000
What?

531
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,600
Here you go.

532
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,160
Be quick.

533
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,080
30 minutes.

534
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
30 minutes, okay?

535
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,840
If you make it,

536
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,520
I'll tip you all nicely.

537
00:24:59,520 --> 00:24:59,920
Got it?

538
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,600
Let’s go, team! Move!

539
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,680
Go! Go! Go! Go!

540
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
For the prize!

541
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,400
Sheesh.

542
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,360
Well,

543
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,800
he must really wants that prize from you.

544
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,720
Anyway,

545
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,400
did you have urgent business with Bay?

546
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,280
I mean,

547
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,840
I do.

548
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,360
But

549
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,120
it's not urgent.

550
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,760
I can

551
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,040
just wait for him.

552
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
What is it about?

553
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,200
Maybe I can help.

554
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
Or, is it about…

555
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,400
[giggles]

556
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,720
I knew you’d laugh, Pat.

557
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,520
But you have to promise me

558
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,440
you won't tell Junji-san about this.

559
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,520
If he finds out,

560
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,320
I’m dead.

561
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,560
Alright, I promise.

562
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
But you're telling me

563
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,560
this advice came from Bay?

564
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,600
Honestly

565
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,680
I still don’t see how

566
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,880
it'll help you complete your mission.

567
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,840
Me neither.

568
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,880
So,

569
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,600
what about you?

570
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,520
Since you are

571
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,160
Junji-san’s only close friend,

572
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,560
can you share some info?

573
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,360
Like, what he likes

574
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,600
or dislikes.

575
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,000
Or what I can do

576
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,200
to impress him

577
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,960
enough to

578
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,280
win his heart,

579
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,160
and

580
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,840
get him to

581
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,760
become my boyfriend?

582
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,400
Oh!

583
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,160
There actually is a way

584
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,600
to impress Junji so much

585
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,960
he’ll say yes to anything.

586
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,320
What is it?

587
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,200
So—

588
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,760
Hold on.

589
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,560
Shh...

590
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
What’s up,

591
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
Boss Junji?

592
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,680
Come on.

593
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,000
They hold the festival every year.

594
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,280
They hold the festival every year.

595
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,160
You can go next year.

596
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
I’ll go with you.

597
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,000
Feeling better?

598
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,320
Good. Relax.

599
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,480
Uh-huh.

600
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,840
It's fine.

601
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,280
We’re friends.

602
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,760
Call me whenever you need to vent.

603
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,880
Okay, bye.

604
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,880
Is

605
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
Junji-san

606
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,960
doing okay?

607
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,280
He just called to complain

608
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,160
that he couldn’t

609
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,120
go to Japan for the Tanabata Festival.

610
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,520
Tanabata Festival?

611
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,000
Then it’s must be a big deal

612
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,040
to Junji-san.

613
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,120
He even called to vent.

614
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,120
He once told me

615
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,520
that his parents first
met during that festival.

616
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,800
So it’s a special occasion for the family,

617
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,720
when they all

618
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,160
get to celebrate

619
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,680
the day the parents met.

620
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,560
But Junji

621
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,880
hasn’t gone back in years.

622
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,400
This year’s the same.

623
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,320
He said the headquarter
in Japan is pushing things.

624
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,120
They want the new game done fast.

625
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,320
For Junji,

626
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,720
work always comes first.

627
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,000
So he’ll get over it soon.

628
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,080
Right.

629
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,120
Okay.

630
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,480
Alright, here

631
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,080
up you go.

632
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,040
Thanks.

633
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,640
Guys,

634
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
I’ll pay you later.

635
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,000
Thanks so much.

636
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,320
Hang on.

637
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,480
Do you have water?

638
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,520
Anyone?

639
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
Splash me.

640
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,480
Make me look tired.

641
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,680
Like I’m sweating.

642
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,880
On my face.

643
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,080
Yeah.

644
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,480
More. The shirt too.

645
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,200
A bit more.

646
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,800
Good.

647
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,560
Do I look tired?

648
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:36,920
Yeah?

649
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,680
Great.

650
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,080
[practices fake panting]

651
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,480
So,

652
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,200
about what we were talking about earlier.

653
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,760
- Oh.
- How to…

654
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
- How to…

655
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,960
Right.

656
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
To impress Junji, you can—

657
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,280
Hey!

658
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm back.

659
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,080
Fast, right?

660
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,560
Look.

661
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,000
I bought everything on your list.

662
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,480
I bought everything on your list.

663
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,880
Here,

664
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,440
you can check.

665
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,840
And

666
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,360
don’t forget

667
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
my prize.

668
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
[sighs]

669
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,840
You and Bay… I’m so jealous.

670
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,760
You get along well.

671
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,080
Well… who knows how long it’ll last.

672
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,640
Why’s that?

673
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,160
Every time I drop by,

674
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,920
you and Bay

675
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,880
always look so happy together.

676
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,040
Seems fine to me.

677
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Yeah.

678
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,720
Everyhing's fine here.

679
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,000
But back home,

680
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,960
I don’t know if they’ll accept Bay.

681
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,680
Really?

682
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,400
But

683
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,640
I think Bay

684
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,640
has changed a lot lately.

685
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,560
He's different.

686
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,480
No more girl problems.

687
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,840
All he talks about is you, Phat.

688
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,760
But my family isn't so simple.

689
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,280
Forget it.

690
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,000
Now I’m the one venting to you.

691
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,800
Now I’m the one venting to you.

692
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,360
Let’s go back to you and Junji.

693
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Right.

694
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,520
Finally get to continue the talk.

695
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,400
If you want to impress Junji…

696
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes.

697
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
…take him there.

698
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,880
It's a rooftop bar

699
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,280
that Junji loves visiting.

700
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,520
He goes every month.

701
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,880
The decor is unique.

702
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,960
All in pink gold, unlike any other bar.

703
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,520
Hello.

704
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,000
They've got rare,

705
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,360
limited edition champagnes,

706
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,640
plus French imports.

707
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,120
Do I have to finish this?

708
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,000
If you can.

709
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,560
Oh, boy.

710
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,280
The view’s superb and romantic.

711
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,680
Junji once said,

712
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,960
"If I had to take the person I love

713
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,080
somewhere really

714
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,080
romantic,

715
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
this would be it."

716
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,880
Tanabata Festival?

717
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,520
He once told me that

718
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,920
his parents first met during that festival.

719
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,200
So it’s a special occasion for the family,

720
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,120
when they all

721
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,560
get to celebrate

722
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,080
the day the parents met.

723
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,440
Thanks for the ride.

724
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,000
Well?

725
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,160
Happy with your reward?

726
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
Well…

727
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,440
Can't complain

728
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,320
about a free meal.

729
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,480
But

730
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,960
it'd be nicer

731
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,640
if

732
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,600
I got

733
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,960
a kiss.

734
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,600
Hey!

735
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,440
Idiot.

736
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,360
Give me my stuff.

737
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,600
Hey!

738
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,000
Get going!

739
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
What's that, Pim?

740
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,840
An art toy.

741
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,160
I bought it.

742
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,880
This one's a limited edition.

743
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,200
I just got it.

744
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
Another new one?

745
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,360
Let me see.

746
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,480
Wow,

747
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,800
that's so cute.

748
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,600
Who dropped you off, Phat?

749
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,320
Oh.

750
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,960
Mom.

751
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,600
Do you want to end up
like me and your sister?

752
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,080
Mom, I—

753
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,040
Phat.

754
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
You’ve seen how your father

755
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,040
treated me.

756
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, mom’s right.

757
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,040
Yeah, mom’s right.

758
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,520
I’ve dated quite

759
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,880
a lot of men.

760
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,400
Almost 20?

761
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,600
They stayed for a bit and left.

762
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,560
Said I'm addicted to art toys.

763
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,160
[sighs]

764
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,640
All of them were trash.

765
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,440
She's right.

766
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,120
I don’t want to see you ruin your life

767
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,400
over a man.

768
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,640
You hear me?

769
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,200
But he and I are working together.

770
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,280
This.

771
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,560
We're reference materials for a game.

772
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,960
Quit it.

773
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,920
What?!

774
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,040
It’s not worth it.

775
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,760
I don’t want you to end up hurt like me.

776
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,400
Please.

777
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,840
Okay, mom.

778
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,680
Phat?

779
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,000
My family didn't take it well,

780
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
My family didn't take it well,

781
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,080
especially my mom.

782
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,720
I’m worried she’ll stress out again.

783
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,600
Stop worrying.

784
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
If your mom meets me,

785
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,800
she'll

786
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
definitely like me.

787
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,480
Heh.

788
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,240
Impossible.

789
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,560
Doesn’t matter who you are,

790
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,680
or if you’re nice.

791
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,400
There’s no way you could

792
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,320
change her mind.

793
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,960
Besides,

794
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,360
I think

795
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,800
I'll have to quit being a reference

796
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,960
for this game.

797
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
No way.

798
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,400
You can’t.

799
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,600
Look.

800
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,080
What will Boss say?

801
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
We’ve come this far.

802
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,000
I’ll tell him myself.

803
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,320
He’ll understand.

804
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,880
Either way,

805
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,680
I have to do this.

806
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,400
I've made a promise.

807
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,960
Sorry, Bay.

808
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,520
Well,

809
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,720
Since

810
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,680
it's come to this,

811
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,680
I'll quit as well.

812
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,640
Bay.

813
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,520
Phat.

814
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,000
Would it be okay

815
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Would it be okay

816
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,560
if I asked you out for real?

817
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm serious. No work involved.

818
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,600
And would it be cool if

819
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,400
I asked you to be my boyfriend?

820
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,120
Hey, you!

821
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,240
- A kiss.
- Hey!

822
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,080
Idiot.

823
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Good choice

824
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,240
Good choice

825
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,520
for a seat, Hill.

826
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
The view’s fantastic.

827
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
Of course, Junji-san.

828
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,840
Since it's our dinner date,

829
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,640
everything has to be

830
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,920
perfect.

831
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,560
Hello.

832
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,960
I made a reservation.

833
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,680
[chuckles]

834
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,680
Target has arrived.

835
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,600
What now?

836
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Target's arrived.

837
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,280
Yeah.

838
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,600
Zoom in.

839
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
There.

840
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,320
Good.

841
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,640
Stop.

842
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,320
Okay.

843
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,920
Great.

844
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,440
Pan to the left, just a bit.

845
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,360
A little more, good.

846
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,360
Wow.

847
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm so envious.

848
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,640
This is so romantic.

849
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,440
Hill picked such a perfect place

850
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,800
and Boss seems happy.

851
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,520
I’m telling you,

852
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,000
Hill

853
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,160
is going to nail it.

854
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,240
He's that good.

855
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,640
Damn.

856
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,760
But wait—

857
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,040
Why?

858
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,880
What if

859
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,120
Hill confesses,

860
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,400
and Boss feels the same

861
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,760
but chooses to play hard to get?

862
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,160
Don't you worry.

863
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,600
Look at this.

864
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,520
See that?

865
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,880
Even if he doesn't admit it,

866
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,840
we can still see what his heart says.

867
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Because I

868
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
planted a heart rate monitor

869
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,360
on his chest.

870
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,680
- Oh my!
- Wow!

871
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,880
Once his heart rate

872
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,920
hits the threshold,

873
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,440
that's when

874
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,400
we'll know

875
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,840
how he feels.

876
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,720
- Whoa.
- So cool.

877
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,360
- Awesome.
- I know.

878
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,760
See?

879
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
I’ve got it all planned out.

880
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,000
You're a genius, Pao.

881
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,320
Shh, keep watching.

882
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,680
- Yeah.
- Let's watch.

883
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,400
Come on, Hill.

884
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,040
Careful,

885
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,400
or you'll get drunk.

886
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,120
It's fine,

887
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,720
Junji-san.

888
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,160
It'll give me—

889
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,400
I mean,

890
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,200
it'll be more fun.

891
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,720
If you throw up,

892
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,160
I won't help.

893
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,360
I'll leave you here.

894
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,480
Jeez.

895
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,440
That's harsh

896
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,640
and mean.

897
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,240
See?

898
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
Junji-san.

899
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,560
You won't abandon me.

900
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,840
Heh.

901
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,200
You're so sly.

902
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,440
Oh!

903
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
- That's it.
- Wow.

904
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,000
Here we go.

905
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,040
Here we go.

906
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,560
Hill!

907
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,000
Oink, oink.

908
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,240
- You even crawl like one.
- So big and fugly.

909
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,480
Oink, oink.

910
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,680
How can anyone get that fat?

911
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,200
Oink, oink.

912
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
You alright, Hill?

913
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,160
I…

914
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,480
I…

915
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,440
I want to…

916
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,960
I want to…

917
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,920
- Yes, say it.
- Say it.

918
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,640
I want to—

919
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,000
- Do it!
- Now!

920
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,760
- Do it!
- Now!

921
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,280
Ugh,

922
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,680
Hill!

923
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,720
Hill, dear!

924
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,160
I want to—

925
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,480
Oh, man.

926
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,560
I want to thank you for

927
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,240
having dinner with me.

928
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,520
Ugh!

929
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,320
Not "thank you."

930
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,200
Ask him out!

931
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,360
- Yeah!
- Ugh!

932
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,200
I should be

933
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,480
the one thanking you.

934
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,160
You don't

935
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,040
look so well.

936
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,160
I think

937
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,040
we should go back.

938
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,160
Target is leaving.

939
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,000
What now?

940
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,840
Should I follow?

941
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,920
Wait!

942
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,320
007

943
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,880
Mission's a bust.

944
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,000
Fall back.

945
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,520
No need to follow them.

946
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,040
It's over.

947
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,320
Man.

948
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,800
Damn it, Hill.

949
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,320
Hill, dear.

950
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,160
Instead of asking him out,

951
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,280
what was that?

952
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,840
For crying out loud!

953
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,400
Good grief.

954
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,160
How are you feeling?

955
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,040
Better?

956
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,840
Told you not to drink so much.

957
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,920
Thank you, Junji-san,

958
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,640
for keeping me company.

959
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,960
It’s fine.

960
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,720
Sometimes a simple walk

961
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,640
can be really nice.

962
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,600
Tanabata?

963
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,160
Yes.

964
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,120
Junji-san.

965
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,720
You should write a wish.

966
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,040
Hm?

967
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,360
Good.

968
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,000
I see.

969
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,720
Okay.

970
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,520
You're done?

971
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,240
Yeah.

972
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,440
I'll write mine too.

973
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,880
I wonder what

974
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,280
you wished for

975
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,120
Junji-san.

976
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,080
Not telling.

977
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,200
What?

978
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,760
And you?

979
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,600
What's your wish?

980
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,040
Not telling.

981
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,760
Hmph.

982
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,040
You sure?

983
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,320
Yup.

984
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,800
Nuh-uh!

985
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,000
What?

986
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,360
You didn't tell me.

987
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,160
Hey!

988
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,000
No fair.

989
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,320
Hey!

990
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,040
No!

991
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,280
That—

992
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,760
Give me—

993
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,520
Give it back.

994
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,680
Junji-san

995
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,720
will you…

996
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:14,400
[Hill crying]

997
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,440
Hill!

998
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,080
Hill!

999
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:31,760
Hill.

1000
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:32,920
Hill.

1001
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,200
Somebody, help!

1002
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,320
Anyone,

1003
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,080
help!

1004
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,720
Please, help!

1005
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,880
Hill.

1006
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,440
How are you feeling?

1007
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,560
Better?

1008
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,240
Hill.

1009
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,880
You're good.

1010
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,000
You could be a detective.

1011
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,920
Thanks for

1012
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,240
working

1013
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,640
so hard

1014
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,680
for me.

1015
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,160
But you

1016
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,240
need to cherish yourself too.

1017
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,560
Otherwise,

1018
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,600
you can't expect

1019
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,720
anyone to love you.

1020
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,080
The reason

1021
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,840
I work so hard

1022
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,920
is because

1023
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,040
this last mission

1024
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,280
is really tough.

1025
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,320
I’m afraid

1026
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,960
that I—

1027
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,320
Don’t give up, Hill.

1028
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,880
Ganbatte ne!

1029
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,200
Don't give up,

1030
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,600
Hill.

1031
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,080
Ganbatte ne!

1032
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,400
And

1033
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
another thing,

1034
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,480
I am

1035
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,600
not sure

1036
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,960
if I will

1037
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,000
pull through.

1038
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,920
No matter what

1039
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,000
that mission is,

1040
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,880
I believe

1041
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,240
you can do it.

1042
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,720
Really?

1043
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,360
Junji-san.

1044
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,120
Really.

1045
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,360
Give it your all, Hill.

1046
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,920
Ganbatte ne!

1047
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,840
Junji-san,

1048
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,160
will you be my boyfriend?

1049
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,600
I must thank you,

1050
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,440
Hill.

1051
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,800
For completing

1052
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,240
every mission.

1053
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,200
Right now we're missing a 3D Programmer.

1054
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,240
Can anyone recommend someone good?

1055
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,400
I suggest…

1056
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,400
Art.

1057
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,600
Former programmer of
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

1058
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,240
Jun-chan and Art ended things ages ago.

1059
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,000
Why are you still feeling this way?
