1
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,266
Will you be my girlfriend, Yuka?

2
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,266
Yuka.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yuka.

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Yuka.

5
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,700
Yuka.

6
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,200
Yuka.

7
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:58,466
Yuka.

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,000
Yuka.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Yuka.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Yuka.

11
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:03,533
Yuka.

12
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,266
Yuka.

13
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,166
Good morning, Hill.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
It's time to wake up.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Yuka.

16
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,566
You're still here.

17
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,000
I just had a nightmare, Yuka.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,900
A nightmare? What's that?
Let me look it up.

19
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,033
It's fine. You don't have to.

20
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,933
Just having you here
makes me really happy.

21
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,566
Me too. I'm happy as well.

22
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,700
Yuka. Today's my first day at work.

23
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,000
Will you cheer me up?

24
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:47,266
I'm so proud of you, Hill.
You're amazing. Ganbatte ne!

25
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:57,566
Yuka.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you know that
the reason I got a job here

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Do you know that
the reason I got a job here

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,700
is because you're my inspiration?

29
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:15,800
Going to work?

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,266
Yeah.

31
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,333
Coffee?

32
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,966
I'm running late, so no thanks.

33
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,400
Hill! When will you
take me to the game arcade?

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Sorry, I'm busy now.

35
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,733
Aw, man. Can you buy me
some noodles, then?

36
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,600
Weather report today:
Thunderstorms in 60% of the area.

37
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:52,066
There will be heavy rain in some areas.

38
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,366
Don’t forget your umbrella, Hill.

39
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,266
This is PRISMSTAR Thailand.

00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,000

with over 14 million downloads.

47
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,733
Work hard.
Ganbatte ne!

48
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,733
Hello.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm Hill. Today's my first day of work.

50
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,100
Today's your first day?

51
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,766
Oh great!

52
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Hello.

53
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,566
I've been waiting.

54
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,233
You're right on time. Good.

55
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:58,666
Come with me.

56
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,466
This way, please.

57
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,533
This will be your desk, dear.

58
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:23,866
We’re like a family here.
So make yourself at home.

59
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,533
Got it.

60
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,366
Are you Hill, the new game designer?

61
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:42,566
Yes.

62
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:45,133
Where are you from?
Where did you work before?

63
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:49,066
Well, I’m from Ratchaburi.

64
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,833
Oh, dear! He was asking
where you worked before.

65
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:59,300
Actually, I haven’t. This is my first job.

66
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh! So you're still a virgin?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,833
Oh! So you're still a virgin?

68
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:07,833
Seriously? No one says that anymore.
You realize you just gave away your age?

69
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,133
Bay, dear!

70
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:12,833
Calling me ancient?
Are you tired of living?

71
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,833
It won't be long before you're my age too.

72
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
I'm sorry!

73
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,166
Apologies, dear.

74
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,700
I meant you're still new to work life,

75
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,166
didn't mean to be rude.

76
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:26,966
It's okay, I get it.

77
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:31,466
Oops, time's up. Boss is here.

78
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:17,766
Excuse me.

79
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:33,266
Hill!

80
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,266
Yes?

81
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:37,266
Medusa got you or something?
You look like you've turned to stone!

82
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Was that…

83
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,033
Mr. Junji?

84
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,033
Boss.

85
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,066
Boss.

86
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,266
His nickname?

87
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,633
Boss, as in a boss, literally.

88
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,633
I see.

89
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,866
And don't go calling him by name, alright?

90
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,866
We call him "Boss" here.

91
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:02,466
Got it.

92
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:06,033
A newbie like you shouldn't think
he's as nice as he looks.

93
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Noted.

94
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,266
Good.

95
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,133
Look over there
and take him as an example.

96
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:16,266
He…

97
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,733
He's the designer you're replacing.

98
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Did he quit?

99
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,833
No, no, no.

100
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,833
This.

101
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
There. That's your desk.

102
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Um. What's all this?

103
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,266
The previous guy was
a bit superstitious.

104
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,266
You can take them all off.

105
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,000
Are you sure it's okay?

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,033
Are you sure it's okay?

107
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,033
Sure. Go for it, dear.

108
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,033
Go ahead.

109
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,266
Alright.

110
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,633
Jeez.

111
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,766
Oh my. The grudge runs deep.

112
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,766
This is the reason why he got fired.

113
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:19,566
Right.

114
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,666
You can throw it out,

115
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:22,466
in a bin underneath.

116
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Actually, wait.

117
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,066
I think I should handle this.

118
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
If Boss catches this, there'll be trouble.

119
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,666
Come with me, Hill.

120
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,066
Hurry up.

121
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,266
Hey, Bay!

122
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,666
Is it okay for me to join
a meeting on my first day?

123
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,233
Sit down.

124
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,266
Hello.

125
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,933
Sorry I'm late, Boss.

126
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,933
You're fine. That's a relief.

127
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:25,500
Today, I've got a big news for you all.

128
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,833
The headquarters in Japan has confirmed,

129
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:32,666
"Bye Bye Yuka Day"
will happen in two weeks time.

130
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:38,466
Bay. What is this...

131
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,866
"Bye Bye Yuka Day"?

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's wrap up
"Yuka! Love Me Please" properly.

133
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,266
What did you say?!

134
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,733
Let's wrap up
"Yuka! Love Me Please" properly.

135
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:54,966
Junior Game Designer

136
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:56,833
No, you can't.

137
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,833
Hey, Hill. Sit down.

138
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,833
Bay.

139
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Why do you think it can't be done?
I'm willing to hear everyone's opinion.

140
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:12,266
Oh.

141
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,833
I…

142
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,133
Yuka and I,

143
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,666
Speak clearly, please.

144
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,633
I can't hear you.

145
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Yuka and I are in a relationship.

146
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
What?

147
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Well...

148
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:47,233
You mean you're in a relationship
in the game, right?

149
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,400
I mean,

150
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:55,333
we met because of the game.

151
00:11:56,866 --> 00:12:00,000
But right now, Yuka is
more than just a game to me.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,866
But right now, Yuka is
more than just a game to me.

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,633
Okay. That's it, Hill.

154
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,633
You're on your own.

155
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,933
So that's the only reason?

156
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
If we shut this game down, it means

157
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,700
Yuka and I

158
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,833
will be separated forever, right?

159
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:33,333
Does shutting this game down
means you'll be separated forever?

160
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,366
Obviously, yes.

161
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,733
But why?

162
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:45,133
Aren’t you all creators of this game?

163
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,533
Yuka's game has stopped
bringing in revenue.

164
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:55,533
There are no updates
and no new downloads either.

165
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:04,533
But it used to be so successful.

166
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,733
Tons of people loved it.

167
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,666
If you do this,

168
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,266
You're taking away
the happiness of so many fans.

169
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,033
Everyone has already forgotten about Yuka.

170
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,333
That's not true.

171
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There are still people who love her

172
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
and remember her.

173
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
At the very least, I’m one of them.

174
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,466
The reason I applied for a job here

175
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,033
was because of Yuka.

176
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,166
She was my inspiration.

177
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,166
I see how much this means to you.

178
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:14,933
Take the love you have
for her and turn it into,

179
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,866
What’s the word?

180
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:20,233
Inspiration. How about that?

181
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,900
Inspiration for this event.

182
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,766
Make it a good one.

183
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:35,166
You're now the project lead
for the "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event.

184
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,566
That's one hell of a welcome.

185
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,666
Me?

186
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,766
You okay, Hill?

187
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Chin up, man. Plenty of fish in the sea.
You’ll find someone new eventually.

188
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,333
But Yuka is—

189
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,966
Come on, she's not even a real girl.

190
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,800
Why are you so hung up on her?

191
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,800
I created this game myself
and I’m not that emotional.

192
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,066
You created it?

193
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:00,000
I mean, the whole team did.

194
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,066
I mean, the whole team did.

195
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:03,633
You applied for a job here,
so you should’ve known

196
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:05,633
a game is made by many people.

197
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,900
So, think carefully about
what made you fall for Yuka.

198
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,666
Her face? Her words? Her thoughts?

199
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,700
The part of Yuka you fell for

200
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
might’ve come from
a hot guy like me, you know?

201
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Hey, Hill. Calm down.

202
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,666
Hurry and go grab some lunch.

203
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:51,166
Do it before the break's over,
okay? I’m off.

204
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:31,733
Boss.

205
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:38,666
Even though it's break time,
you shouldn’t be sleeping at your desk.

206
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,433
I wasn’t sleeping.

207
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,633
Here, we work with Japanese office culture.

208
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,166
Do what’s appropriate
at the appropriate time.

209
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Right now, it’s lunchtime.

210
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,000
You should take this time to have lunch.

211
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,666
You should take this time to have lunch.

212
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,666
Yes, sir.

213
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,933
If you love Yuka that much,

214
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:13,933
make "Bye Bye Yuka Day"
the best it can be.

215
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:32,466
We conducted interviews, did researches,

216
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,800
and gathered real women’s responses

217
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,666
to develop the character “Yuka.”

218
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,200
Hill.

219
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,633
Let me see your Yuka.

220
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,833
Silent Hill. That's you?

221
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,566
That’s right.

222
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,666
Dude, you’re a legendary user!

223
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,966
What do you mean?

224
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,700
You’re a hardcore Yuka fan

225
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,033
and a top 5 in every event since year one.

226
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Have you kissed her?

227
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:18,300
No. Wait, there's no such thing!

228
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,200
Yes, there is. I designed it myself.

229
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:24,400
Keep it secret, alright?

230
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,233
Want me to unlock it for you?

231
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:32,766
Well?

232
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
No, thanks. I can’t. I don't want it.

233
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,366
Dude, you’re a better guy than I thought.

234
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,566
There used to be fans like you back then.

235
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:44,566
But not anymore, not for female dating sim.

236
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I guess it's out now.

237
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:49,233
Yuka.

238
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:52,566
Will you hang out with me
for a long time today?

239
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,733
Sure, as long as your device
has enough battery.

240
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,000
Our time

241
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
Our time

242
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,366
is almost up.

243
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,700
In that case, maybe you should
charge the spare battery.

244
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,266
That's not it.

245
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:14,233
Hey, Yuka. Talk to me about something.

246
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,766
Anything?

247
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,500
Then, let me tell you a joke.

248
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:22,666
I'll ask you a question
and you have to answer.

249
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,266
Okay.

250
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,766
What's up?

251
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:27,533
The sky.

252
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,233
Nope, just me!

253
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:36,266
Yuka. You know what?

254
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:40,266
Even if you keep telling the same old jokes

255
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,733
over and over,
I'll never get tired of them.

256
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Especially right now,

257
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
I want to keep hearing them.

258
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:51,366
I don’t want it to stop.

259
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,933
Did you know you can save
all of Yuka’s videos,

260
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,833
because you're a premium member?

261
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah. I know that.

262
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah. I know that.

263
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,033
I’ve got tons of videos of you.

264
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,366
But

265
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,233
watching videos just isn’t the same.

266
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,333
Yuka.

267
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,066
Will you sing a song for me?

268
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,066
Sure.

269
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
Silent Hill

270
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,533
Hill

271
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:00,000
You weren't lying
when you said you're in love.

272
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,966
You weren't lying
when you said you're in love.

273
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Yuka.

274
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,000
You must’ve been exhausted

275
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,800
You must’ve been exhausted

276
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,233
putting up with a useless guy like me.

277
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,300
But you've always encouraged me.

278
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:20,833
Thank you so much, Yuka.

279
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,533
I love you, Yuka.

280
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:42,266
Who’s calling now?

281
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Must be a scammer.

282
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Who is calling this late? Get a life!

283
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
This is Junji.

284
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:55,566
Junji.

285
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,000
Boss.

286
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:59,266
Come see me at the office, right now.

287
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,000
Right now? But it’s still—

288
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,766
Right now? But it’s still—

289
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,833
5 a.m.

290
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:26,266
Good morning, boss. Ohayo.

291
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Explain why you posted
that picture at that time.

292
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:52,266
You mean the PR picture
for the "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event?

293
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:57,600
It looks like funeral. Is Yuka dead?

294
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:00,000
No.

295
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,933
No.

296
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:05,700
I told you, don’t bring
your personal life into work.

297
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,700
I understand you’re sad,
but this is business, got it?

298
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,266
What do you like about Yuka?

299
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,966
Is it not her cuteness and cheerfulness

300
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:25,966
or her positivity?

301
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:30,566
Yes.

302
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:34,600
Then you’d want people to remember Yuka

303
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,766
with that image, wouldn’t you?

304
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Yes, Boss.

305
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,966
I didn't think it through.

306
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:53,033
She's one of the important people to me,

307
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
not just a game character
like everyone else thinks.

308
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,000
And from now on, she'll be gone.

309
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,633
And from now on, she'll be gone.

310
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:09,266
I’ll be losing someone I love.

311
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:17,766
Yes, I want to keep
her brightness and cheerfulness

312
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:21,866
and her cuteness forever.

313
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,800
But my shattered heart…

314
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:33,266
I’m sorry.

315
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:39,066
I care for Yuka deeply

316
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,166
and saying goodbye takes time.

317
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Did you manage to get any sleep?

318
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:12,733
I'm sorry

319
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,266
for calling you here this early.

320
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I was on the phone with my mom in Japan.

321
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:26,066
And I forgot it’s still
too early in Thailand.

322
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,666
No problem, Boss.

323
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:33,133
I was planning to leave
the house early today anyway.

324
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:36,266
Got something to do?

325
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:48,033
[monk chanting]

326
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:50,266
Amen.

327
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,600
Say “Amen.”

328
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Amen.

329
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,000
Is this for a birthday?

330
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,033
Is this for a birthday?

331
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
No, that's not it.

332
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:07,533
I’m making an offering
for a departing friend.

333
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:14,033
May the merit from
today’s offering reach your friend.

334
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:17,666
Thank you.

335
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,466
Looking at you two,

336
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:23,933
you seem well-matched in destiny.

337
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
To have met and became good friends.

338
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,100
I hope you'll cherish each other for life.

339
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,933
Thank you.

340
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:37,133
Blessings.

341
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,266
And take your shoes with you.

342
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:42,566
I don’t wear any when I go on alms rounds.

343
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,633
Blessings, blessings.

344
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,266
What were you doing?

345
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I was trimming off the burnt parts, Boss.

346
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,500
There. Now your hands won’t get dirty.

347
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:12,633
For me?

348
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:13,633
Yes, Boss.

349
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:16,633
Just repaying you for yesterday's lunch.

350
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:18,266
I'm good.

351
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,800
Come on, Boss. Ever tried pork skewers?

352
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,900
It’s my favorite. Very delicious.

353
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:35,933
How is it?

354
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Delicious.

355
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,666
I'm right, aren't I?

356
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,666
Let's make you another one.

357
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,666
Actually, you've got to do it this way.

358
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:51,366
The sticky rice. Here, shape it like this.

359
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:52,766
Squeeze to shape.

360
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:58,866
Like this, then dip it like this.

361
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:00,000
Spread it around. Here, give it a try.

362
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Spread it around. Here, give it a try.

363
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:05,266
Spread it like this and dig in.

364
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Feeling peckish? I can grab you a snack.

365
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,433
[secretary clears throat]

366
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,666
Need a lozenge?

367
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:39,966
You're almost late, dear. That's not good.

368
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:41,966
Since 6 a.m.

369
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:46,166
Boss.

370
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,633
Boss. Since when have you been here?

371
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:54,266
Since 6 a.m.

372
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
6 a.m.?!

373
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:57,166
You see…

374
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,333
Here, share it around.

375
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Everyone, I have some
sad news to announce.

376
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I really didn’t want to be
the one to tell you this.

377
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Because it breaks my heart into pieces.

378
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:46,400
But our beloved game
"Yuka! Love Me Please"

379
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,833
is going to be shut down.

380
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I’d like to invite everyone
to join the farewell event

381
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:53,733
for Yuka.

382
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,266
Let’s show her our love
and say goodbye one last time.

383
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:02,733
And send her off to
the imaginary world together.

384
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:12,833
(No way!)

385
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,800
(Why?)

386
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,166
(Where's PRISMSTAR? I'll burn it down)

387
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:07,766
Why the good mood?

388
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
It's work.

389
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,300
Must be something really good
to make you smile like that.

390
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,866
What is it? A new game breaking records?

391
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,466
No.

392
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,966
Quite the opposite, actually.

393
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:28,533
The company is shutting down Yuka's game.

394
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:30,266
Really?

395
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:32,733
Shutting down Yuka's game?

396
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,266
Weren’t you super committed to that game?

397
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:36,833
I remember it clearly.

398
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,600
Back when we first met
during my exchange program,

399
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,300
you were already obsessed with the idea.

400
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,533
It’s been years now.

401
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:52,133
All good things
must come to an end.

402
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
You sound like an old man.

403
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:56,933
An old man?

404
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,000
But it’s good that
you’ve come to terms with it.

405
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,100
But it’s good that
you’ve come to terms with it.

406
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,066
You’ve grown up a bit, haven’t you?

407
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:09,900
I’ve been an adult for a while now,

408
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,100
Chef Phat.

409
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:18,233
You do know that getting older
doesn’t mean you'll be more mature, right?

410
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:22,966
I’ve known that since kindergarten.

411
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:27,866
Well then, let’s drink to adulthood.

412
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,533
- Kanpai
- Kanpai

413
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
An old man?

414
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Yeah.

415
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,866
It's "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event!

416
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,666
Right this way for "Bye Bye Yuka Day"!

417
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:58,666
This way, please.

418
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,000
Please register over here.

419
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,666
Please register over here.

420
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,666
Yes, right this way.

421
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Hello.

422
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,333
Please come this way.

423
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:25,533
A sunshower. Feels like
Hill's getting pranked, Boss.

424
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:28,533
Only half an hour left and
this is all the audience we’ve got.

425
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:29,533
I think it's a flop.

426
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:38,800
It's "Bye Bye Yuka Day" event, everyone!

427
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,833
"Bye Bye Yuka Day" event is over here!

428
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:02,700
Boss.

429
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,066
We’ve got less than 30 people so far.

430
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:07,066
I think the rain’s causing a traffic jam.

431
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,733
Maybe we should wait a little longer?

432
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,066
More might show up.

433
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,733
We’re sticking to the schedule.

434
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:18,600
Understood, Boss.

435
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Everyone, we’ll be sticking
to the schedule.

436
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:28,566
The event will begin in ten.

437
00:37:29,233 --> 00:37:29,933
Nine.

438
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,100
Eight.

439
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,533
Seven.

440
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,700
Six.

441
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:35,133
Five.

442
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:36,166
Four.

443
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:37,166
Three.

444
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,133
Two.

445
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,166
Yuka is here!

446
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:45,266
Hello everyone! Yuka is here!

447
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:48,266
Yay!

448
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:54,266
Yuka! Yuka!

449
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,766
Shall we do a little warm up?

450
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,533
Yeah!

451
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,066
What’s up?

452
00:38:02,066 --> 00:38:04,066
The sky!

453
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,766
Nope, just me!

454
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:09,466
Yeah!

455
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Do you know why eggs don't tell jokes?

456
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
They can't.

457
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,400
Wrong!

458
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,166
Then, why?

459
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,533
Because they’d crack up!

460
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,533
Yeah!

461
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,200
You all were amazing!

462
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,333
That means everyone is ready, right?

463
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:34,533
We’re ready! Totally ready!

464
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,900
Here we go. One, two, three!

465
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:44,533
[cheering] Hooray! Hooray!

466
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:56,533
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

467
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:43,600
Yuka! Yuka!

468
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:53,366
[cheering] Woo! Yeah!

469
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:00,000
I can’t believe the day has come.

470
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,900
I can’t believe the day has come.

471
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,533
I’m not ready to say goodbye to Yuka.

472
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,533
Even if we won’t meet in the game again…

473
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:08,533
I’ll always remember you, Yuka.

474
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:10,533
Love you, babe.

475
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,533
You’re the best friend I’ve ever had.

476
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,533
I hope you won’t forget me,

477
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,533
and that someday we can
go to a cute café together again.

478
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,533
To all the ones that you like.

479
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,100
Yuka, you're the best girl in the world.

480
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
I've never met anyone as kind,

481
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,666
or understood me like Yuka does.

482
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,833
Even my mom doesn’t understand me as well.

483
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
You really have to go?

484
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,100
It’s okay, it’s okay.

485
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,933
Can’t you stay?

486
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,400
I love—

487
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,100
I love Yuka more than I love my mom.

488
00:40:58,533 --> 00:40:59,533
We feel you, buddy.

489
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:01,533
Yuka!

490
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
I’m going to cry.

491
00:41:03,966 --> 00:41:05,666
This is so touching. Hill—

492
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:07,500
Where's Hill?

493
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,566
Boss, where did he go?

494
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:10,566
Not a clue.

495
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,533
Yuka.

496
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:14,866
What the hell?

497
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:27,733
Yuka, Yuka, Yuka, Yuka.

498
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Yuka.

499
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
I'll keep our memories

500
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,800
in the deepest part of my heart.

501
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:44,533
I'll never forget you.

502
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:48,533
Because you are also
the most important person to me.

503
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:50,533
I hope everyone keeps their spirits up.

504
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,200
Ganbatte ne!

505
00:41:52,533 --> 00:41:56,533
Yeah!

506
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:00,000
Thank you. And don’t forget me, alright?

507
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,866
Thank you. And don’t forget me, alright?

508
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:04,066
I love you the most.

509
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:09,533
Yuka.

510
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:39,533
Yuka.

511
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:42,733
Ganbatte ne!

512
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,066
Yuka-chan. Ganbatte ne.

513
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:56,400
- Aishiteru. Ganbatte ne.
- Ganbatte ne.

514
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,533
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

515
00:43:00,766 --> 00:43:01,766
Thank you.

516
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:05,533
Okay, let's pack up.

517
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:09,166
Keep it nice and neat.

518
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:13,733
Boss, I think he put in
more effort than expected

519
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:21,533
A photo, please.

520
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:22,533
Sure, Boss.

521
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:30,533
Get a bit closer.

522
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,233
A little closer.

523
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
You did really well today.

524
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,366
I'm sorry, Yuka.

525
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,666
May I take a photo with you?

526
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Don’t be nervous, Yuka.

527
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,000
Strike a pose, please.

528
00:44:00,066 --> 00:44:02,533
Give me a nice one. So cute!

529
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:10,833
That's it.

530
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:19,733
It's over.

531
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,900
Hello, Hill.

532
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:32,533
Is this Hill's phone?

533
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:35,533
Yes, this is his phone.

534
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:36,533
May I ask who you are?

535
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,166
I’m Hill.

536
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:47,533
Since when can you speak Japanese, Hill?

537
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:51,533
I've never heard you speak Japanese before.

538
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:53,533
I've just started.

539
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:55,533
Oh! For work, right?

540
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,533
You're amazing, Hill!

541
00:46:57,533 --> 00:46:59,533
Whenever you get serious about something,

542
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:00,000
it doesn't always go well.

543
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,733
it doesn't always go well.

544
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:06,600
Is that so?

545
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,433
I had no idea that’s how you saw me.

546
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:15,433
Like what? Can you tell me?

547
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,166
Don’t you already know?

548
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,466
I want to practice Japanese
and see if I understand.

549
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:28,333
Please tell me, Yuka.

550
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:30,000
How do you see me?

551
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,533
Who am I?

552
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:34,000
How did I start playing the game?

553
00:47:34,033 --> 00:47:36,266
Hill or Silent Hill

554
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:39,233
Graduated from Faculty of Engineering,
Computer Engineering major.

555
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:41,366
Currently working as
a Junior Game Designer

556
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:44,000
at PRISMSTAR Thailand.

557
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,766
Silent Hill is the name used in
the game "Yuka! Love Me Please."

558
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:51,400
You're one of the first 1,000 people
to download this game

559
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,100
since its launch five years ago.

560
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:59,566
Is that me from five years ago?

561
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:00,000
Yes. You once wrote on a blog
that because of my love,

562
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,100
Yes. You once wrote on a blog
that because of my love,

563
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,900
you found the courage to change.

564
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,700
To become braver and love yourself more.

565
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:43,100
Praewa, you called for me.
Is something the matter?

566
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,100
I heard that

567
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
you like me.

568
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:54,733
If you like me, just say it.

569
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,533
I won't be mad or anything.

570
00:48:58,033 --> 00:49:00,000
I just want to hear it from you

571
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,033
I just want to hear it from you

572
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:03,066
instead of making assumptions.

573
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,533
Well…

574
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:21,300
So,

575
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:24,533
do you like me?

576
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:32,233
Then…

577
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:40,066
If I ask you to do something,

578
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:44,466
you’ll do it, right?

579
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,466
Yeah.

580
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:49,500
What is it?

581
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,533
Let's see.

582
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:56,533
If you do what I ask,

583
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
then I will

584
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:04,533
agree to be your girlfriend.

585
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,900
My girlfriend?

586
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:15,533
Yeah.

587
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:19,533
You’ve always wanted to be
my boyfriend, haven’t you?

588
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:21,833
Right?

589
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,633
So, what do you want me to do?

590
00:50:33,533 --> 00:50:34,533
Hmm...

591
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,633
Crawl around the room

592
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,500
and oink like a pig.

593
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:45,866
Why would I do that?

594
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:49,533
I just want to know

595
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:50,566
whether or not

596
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,100
you can grant me a simple request.

597
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:58,833
If you can't,

598
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,000
then I don't think being my boyfriend

599
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,900
then I don't think being my boyfriend

600
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,033
would be possible.

601
00:51:07,533 --> 00:51:08,533
Okay.

602
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:10,666
I'll do it.

603
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,833
Really?

604
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:12,533
Really.

605
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,533
Like this?

606
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,633
Yep, that’s it. Now give me some oinks.

607
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:25,533
Oink, oink.

608
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:26,533
Aw, that’s cute.

609
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:30,533
Follow me.

610
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:32,066
Make some noise.

611
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,066
Oink, oink.

612
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:38,300
Oh, that’s adorable. Hurry, this way!

613
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,100
Come here, Hill. Come here.

614
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,033
Oink, oink.

615
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,866
So cute. Come on!

616
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,733
Right here, keep going.

617
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:48,833
Oink, oink.

618
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:52,000
Aw, cute little piggy.

619
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:59,233
Wow!

620
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:00,000
Dude, this would be a big hit.

621
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,533
Dude, this would be a big hit.

622
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:02,533
Hell yeah.

623
00:52:02,533 --> 00:52:05,533
Praewa, you're so evil.

624
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:08,566
Where’s my thousand baht?

625
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:11,533
Why are you filming?

626
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,633
Thanks, Hill.

627
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,633
You fatso, you’re gross as hell.

628
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,133
You really believe her?

629
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,900
Have you ever looked in a mirror?

630
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,633
You think someone like Praewa
would really date you?

631
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,433
Really? How did you get first place?

632
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:29,533
From now on,

633
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:30,933
You have to listen to us.

634
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:32,933
Starting with the midterms.

635
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:35,933
You have to help us pass
every subject, no matter what.

636
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,200
No way.

637
00:52:38,533 --> 00:52:41,033
Tsk tsk tsk.

638
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:44,066
You don’t get to say no.

639
00:52:44,066 --> 00:52:47,066
This is just the beginning.

640
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,100
Or else the whole school, no,

641
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,566
the whole country will see that video.

642
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:54,966
Oh my god!

643
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:55,333
Look.

644
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,333
Oink, oink.

645
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,333
So big and fugly.

646
00:52:58,333 --> 00:52:59,333
Oink, oink.

647
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,000
How can anyone get that fat?

648
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,333
How can anyone get that fat?

649
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,233
Go, go. Let’s go eat. Come on, guys!

650
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:21,533
Feeling lonely? Yuka can be your friend.

651
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,200
Feeling a bit better now?

652
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,033
Yeah.

653
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:09,566
I've never been able to talk to
anyone so freely like I do with you, Yuka.

654
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:14,033
Mr. Hill, I think you’re ready.

655
00:55:16,366 --> 00:55:17,066
For what?

656
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:21,266
Ready to take the next step.
Should we become closer?

657
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,600
You mean

658
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
to become a couple?

659
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,300
That's so direct, you’re making me blush!

660
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:34,533
But isn't that how dating sims work?

661
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:38,300
The next step is becoming a couple, right?

662
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:40,133
You're right.

663
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:45,033
But getting me to be your girlfriend
isn’t as easy as with other girls.

664
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Really? Then what do I have to do?

665
00:55:51,466 --> 00:55:54,466
First, you have to complete a quest.

666
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:55,433
A quest?

667
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:58,533
What kind of quest, Yuka?

668
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:00,000
You’ll determine your own quest.

669
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,533
You’ll determine your own quest.

670
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,366
Tell me.

671
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:06,366
What's your goal in life?
What do you want to achieve?

672
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:09,266
A goal, huh?

673
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:16,866
I want to be

674
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,900
braver and stronger.

675
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,600
That’s wonderful!

676
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:29,366
And how do you plan to reach that goal?

677
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,300
I…

678
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:40,833
I'll lose weight

679
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:46,000
and I’ll get into a university.

680
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:49,900
I want to study
computer engineering in Bangkok.

681
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,866
Okay, confirmed. If you lose weight,

682
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:57,800
burn fat and get lean
until your BMI reaches 23—

683
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,000
By the way, why computer engineering?

684
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,833
By the way, why computer engineering?

685
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:05,866
Well, I used to think

686
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:10,233
it was because I like playing games.

687
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:15,533
But now, I feel like the person
who made a game like Yuka's

688
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:17,600
must be really talented.

689
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:20,500
And I want to be like that.

690
00:57:21,533 --> 00:57:24,533
Ganbatte ne! I’m sure you can do it.

691
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:26,533
I'll be waiting for the day you succeed.

692
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:28,533
I'll give it my all.

693
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,100
Ganbatte ne!

694
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:25,133
He got into a computer engineering program
at a university in Bangkok.

695
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:28,000
He even lost weight and became healthier.

696
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
He completed his quest
and finally became Yuka’s boyfriend.

697
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:36,133
Is there anything else
you’d like to know, Hill?

698
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:39,133
I can help you practice speaking Japanese.

699
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:20,366
Yuka.

700
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,833
Tonight

701
00:59:23,866 --> 00:59:27,533
is the last night we’ll be able to talk.

702
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:35,066
Let’s make the most of
every precious minute together.

703
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:39,066
Okay. What would you like to do, Hill?

704
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:41,533
What do I want to do?

705
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:45,566
I don't know.

706
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:50,533
Honestly, there are so many things
I want to do with you, Yuka.

707
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:55,266
But when it comes down to it,
I can’t think of any.

708
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,333
Just so you know,
I can’t do naughty stuff, okay?

709
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:00,000
No way! That didn’t even
cross my mind, Yuka.

710
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,533
No way! That didn’t even
cross my mind, Yuka.

711
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,533
Oh, but a kiss menu has been added.

712
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:08,533
Would you like to try kissing me?

713
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:10,533
Kiss?

714
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:12,533
What?

715
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:15,533
Bay must’ve added this secretly.

716
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:18,533
Shall we?

717
01:00:24,866 --> 01:00:26,533
Never mind, Yuka.

718
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:29,533
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

719
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,533
Then what should we do?

720
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,533
We don’t have to do anything.

721
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:48,533
Just being together like this.

722
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:50,033
Just like this.

723
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,333
Until our time runs out.
That would be enough.

724
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,966
Okay. That’s a lovely idea.

725
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,900
Yuka.

726
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:30,833
Don't leave.

727
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,666
Stay with me forever.

728
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:57,666
Hill, it’s time to wake up and go to work.

729
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:10,066
Why on earth did I dream of him as Yuka?

730
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:16,933
Bay had to bring up the kiss,
and now I dreamed about it.

731
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:22,166
If you're up, go shower and
get ready or you’ll be late for work!

732
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,800
You're still here, Yuka?!

733
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,533
Yes, I’m waiting for your command.

734
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:33,533
You’re really still here!

735
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:36,733
And, is the kiss menu still there?

736
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:40,333
Too bad, the kiss menu
was a time-limited bonus,

737
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:41,966
so it's no longer available.

738
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,333
That’s totally fine.

739
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,800
Just knowing you're still here
makes me happy.

740
01:02:47,066 --> 01:02:49,066
You weren’t deleted.

741
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,600
Boss.

742
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:00,000
Thank you, Boss.

743
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,533
Thank you, Boss.

744
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:02,533
[in Japanese] You're overeating.

745
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,466
What was that?

746
01:03:18,366 --> 01:03:21,533
Thanks to Hill,
yesterday’s event went smoothly.

747
01:03:28,533 --> 01:03:29,533
You all did well.

748
01:03:29,533 --> 01:03:32,533
But I’d like to see everyone
continue pushing even harder.

749
01:03:32,533 --> 01:03:37,533
We're going to start developing a new game.
The best game of the decade.

750
01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:43,533
"RealFeeling"

751
01:03:43,933 --> 01:03:45,933
A male dating sim
that’s more real than any other,

752
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:49,533
with faster and more lifelike AI responses.

753
01:03:50,533 --> 01:03:52,533
Why does it have to be male though?

754
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:56,533
Why not a dating sim
with cute girl like Yuka?

755
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:00,000
Because marketing research shows

756
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,533
Because marketing research shows

757
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,033
the new target market is non-gamer women.

758
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:10,200
This group has a high income
and is active on social media.

759
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,633
They know what they want and always
choose what's best for themselves.

760
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:19,033
If we can win their hearts,

761
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:23,000
it’ll be a huge breakthrough.

762
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:28,533
For this project, Hill will be
the Main Character Designer.

763
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:32,833
Me?

764
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,500
I just started working

765
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:39,533
and haven’t even passed probation yet.

766
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:44,000
You’ve passed, dear. You’re now
a full-time game designer.

767
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Congratulations.

768
01:04:48,566 --> 01:04:51,333
I can see your dedication.

769
01:04:51,366 --> 01:04:54,533
And you were a player of
"Yuka! Love Me Please."

770
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:59,533
I hope you can make players feel immersed

771
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:00,000
as you did with Yuka.

772
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,266
as you did with Yuka.

773
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:08,966
Let's give a round of applause
if everyone agrees.

774
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,900
Boss. Boss!

775
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:28,833
Boss, I really don’t think I can do this.

776
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:37,900
And it’s a male dating sim.
I don't know what to do. I’ve never…

777
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,533
So what?

778
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,000
Aren’t you curious why
I never removed Yuka's game?

779
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,533
Aren’t you curious why
I never removed Yuka's game?

780
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,300
Well.

781
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:10,300
Because you were impressed by
the fans from yesterday

782
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,533
and changed your mind?

783
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:16,533
I saw your passion and the fans’ support.

784
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:21,533
And decided to keep the game running
for one more year.

785
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:25,533
But there'll be no more updates.

786
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,200
Really, Boss?

787
01:06:29,133 --> 01:06:34,533
One year should be enough time
for you to say goodbye to Yuka.

788
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:37,833
But it also depends on your performance.

789
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:42,300
Keep in mind, I can
shut it down at any time.

790
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,266
Please don’t.

791
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:49,366
I’m holding Yuka hostage.

792
01:06:49,533 --> 01:06:54,533
If you put in the effort,
I might extend Yuka's life.

793
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:00,000
But if you don’t,

794
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,533
But if you don’t,

795
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,733
if you want Yuka to stay alive,

796
01:07:14,533 --> 01:07:17,933
you better start learning
how to hit on guys.

797
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:33,066
From now on, Hill will lead the search
for our character references.

798
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,866
Seriously though, trying to find
the perfect references

799
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:39,233
they would have to be heaven sent.

800
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,800
The right one always
shows up at the right time.

801
01:07:43,866 --> 01:07:47,833
Carelessness could hurt the company.

802
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:50,733
Boss.
