3
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,430
What do you like
about Prince of Ning An?

4
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,310
He's not a good person.

5
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,310
Says who?

6
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
In my eyes,

7
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,840
he's the best.

8
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,310
You love me,

9
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,230
don't you?

10
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,960
You are

11
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,320
God's gift for me.

12
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Su Qin.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,150
Marry me.

14
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm just an ordinary girl.

15
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Since I was a child,

16
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,020
I have dreamed

17
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,410
to be with someone
that I love.

18
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,190
A loving couple

19
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,120
lives a simple life together.

20
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
The truth is,

21
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,010
I have been lying to you.

22
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,360
I know.

23
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,690
Chun,

24
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,770
I will marry you formally,

25
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,820
no longer as a concubine.

26
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,620
I give you my promise.

27
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,390
(Su Qin.)

28
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,870
(Don't be afraid.)

29
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,280
(Wait for me.)

30
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,110

31
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,480

32
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720

33
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,270
