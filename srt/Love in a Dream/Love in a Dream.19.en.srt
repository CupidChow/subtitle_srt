=Episode 19=

3
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,590
What is this place?

4
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,950
Who are you?

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,280
Where am I?

6
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,950
Why did you lie to me?

7
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,310
I didn't mean to.

8
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,480
- Why did you lie?
- I didn't mean to.

9
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,760
I didn't.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
I didn't lie.

11
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,070
I'm not a liar.

12
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,870
I fell asleep.

13
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,560
Lu Huan!

14
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Are you okay?

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
How do you feel?

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm fine.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,430
Sorry to worry you.

18
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,190
Good to know.

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,150
Good to know
you're fine.

20
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,430
Were you...

21
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,710
Were you worried about me?

22
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,310
Duh!

23
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,360
Quickly!
They are up there!

24
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,150
Quickly!

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Hurry!

26
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,750
My mother

27
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,470
was an offering.

28
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,470
Father loved her,

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
but Mother

30
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,240
is a gentle

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,430
and fragile woman.

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,750
She never understood

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,520
how to survive

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,630
in a foreign harem.

35
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,910
Since I could remember,

36
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,840
Mother and I
had been bullied.

37
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Mother told me,

38
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,190
"In the harem,

39
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,910
don't argue,

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
don't fight,

41
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,310
don't steal,

42
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,590
don't think,

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,310
so you survive."

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,630
But one day,

45
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,520
she told me

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,310
she was going home.

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,480
That was the last time
I met her.

48
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,630
She made a new pair
of shoes for me overnight.

49
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,000
She told me

50
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,270
to survive
in the imperial palace.

51
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,750
And that when my feet

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,560
could fit into the shoes,

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,270
she'd send people
to get me home.

54
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,510
After that,

55
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,560
I continued to live
in the imperial palace,

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,750
still being bullied by them.

57
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,600
Sometimes,

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
I would eat spoiled food,

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,510
I would drink dirty water.

60
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,120
But I told myself

61
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,190
that I must survive,

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
I must eat it,

63
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,120
so I could get out alive

64
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,000
to see Mother again.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,870
When I turned 9,

66
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
my feet could finally

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,920
fit into those shoes,

68
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,190
but Mother

69
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,190
didn't send anyone.

70
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,950
And then?

71
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,390
Then what happened?

72
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,870
About that,

73
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,270
I'll tell you later.

74
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,700
We've had enough rest.

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Let's get going.

76
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,750
OK.

77
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll celebrate every
birthday of yours

78
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,480
with you in the future.

79
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,830
The truth is,

80
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,830
I have been lying to you.

81
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,050
I know.

82
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,390
Chun,

83
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,330
I will marry you formally,

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,470
no longer as a concubine.

85
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,320
I give you my promise.

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Chun.

87
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,960
Chun.

88
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
Chun.

89
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,720
Chun.

90
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,270
Your Grace,

91
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,270
the emperor has
met Prince of Ning An.

92
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Noble Consort Su
is with them.

93
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,210
And...

94
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,950
What?

95
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,170
Speak.

96
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,430
Who do you serve?

97
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,720
No one, my lord.

98
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,680
I'm just a villager.

99
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,750
No matter how
many times you ask,

100
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,920
this is still my answer.

101
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,920
You look familiar.

102
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,900
I never saw you before.

103
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,770
You liar.

104
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,360
You saw me in Guazhou.

105
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,740
You serve Prince of Guazhou.

106
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,200
No.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,080
I... I...

108
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,960
I don't know
who that is.

109
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,110
Liar.

110
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,270
You were sent here

111
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,320
to aid Prince of Guazhou.

112
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,390
You've been
with him this month.

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,960
I'm innocent.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
I...

115
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,960
Someone in the imperial
palace sent you.

116
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm a commoner.

117
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,080
I don't know anyone
in the imperial palace.

118
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,990
Liar.

119
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,360
You're the 35th
adopted son

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
of Lord De Quan.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,870
What?

122
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
Say

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,660
you don't know
Lord De Quan.

124
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
You don't know him.

125
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,100
Ah! I don't know
who De Quan is.

126
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,420
Liar. You've known him
for more than a decade.

127
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,940
Su Qin, how dare you!

128
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,380
Your Majesty.

129
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,170
You are not
to slander Lord De Quan.

130
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,860
Your Majesty,

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,860
Su Qin has
no such intention.

132
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,420
I

133
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,940
believe what she says.

134
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,820
With the unfounded,

135
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,470
baseless presumption,

136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,260
you expect me

137
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,360
to convict
a senior official

138
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,940
who have served
two generations in Dacheng?

139
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,180
Su Qin,

140
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,940
it's a crime

141
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,860
to slander a loyal official.

142
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,100
Your Majesty,

143
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,500
that wasn't slander.

144
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,780
I

145
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,800
guarantee with my life.

146
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,980
Lu Huan!

147
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,470
Please pardon her.

148
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,820
Huh?

149
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,120
I...

150
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,980
Hey.

151
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,220
Your Majesty.

152
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,100
Your Majesty, look.

153
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,860
It's them.

154
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,260
They exchanged information

155
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,500
to keep trace of you.

156
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
They plotted and performed

157
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,880
the attempted assassination.

158
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,660
Chun.

159
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,540
Chun is...

160
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,940
