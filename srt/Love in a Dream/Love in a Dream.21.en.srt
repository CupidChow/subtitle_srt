=Episode 21=

3
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,920
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,070
I will

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
stop here.

6
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
Mmh.

7
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,300
You'll go back home
with His Majesty.

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,340
Why?

9
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,220
Why aren't you coming
with us?

10
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,020
Sorry, Su Qin,

11
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,620
but

12
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,780
I'm afraid I'll have
to go in Guazhou's direction.

13
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,940
You go back
to the capital city first.

14
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,220
Don't worry about me.

15
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,980
Lu Huan.

16
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Your Majesty,

17
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
please get
into the carriage.

18
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Don't worry.

19
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,060
His Highness
will come home soon.

20
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,820
Come home early.

21
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,020
Yay.

22
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,780
Yay.

23
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,940
Your Majesty,

24
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,940
Prince of Guazhou
committed a massacre.

25
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,580
Most people
escaped the city.

26
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Give the loose change

27
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,460
to the refugees.

28
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,860
Aye.

29
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,900
Your Majesty,

30
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,300
Su Qin is gone.

31
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,820
What?

32
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,890
Yay!

33
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,660
Lu Huan!

34
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,660
Lu Huan!

35
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Lu Huan!

36
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,740
Lu Huan!

37
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,060
Lu Huan!

38
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,900
Lu Huan, wake up!

39
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,940
Lu Huan!

40
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,020
Lu Huan, wake up!

41
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,860
Lu Huan!

42
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,100
Lu Huan!

43
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,020
Lu Huan!

44
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
Wake up!

45
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,620
Wake up!

46
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,380
Hang in there.

47
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,540
Lu Huan.

48
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,860
Lu Huan.

49
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,380
Lu Huan.

50
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Wake up.

51
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,460
Lu Huan.

52
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Lu Huan.

53
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,260
My lord.

54
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,300
The prince...

55
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,220
He has failed.

56
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,340
What?

57
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,780
The prince has failed?

58
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,940
Yes, my lord.

59
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,940
They left unharmed.

60
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,140
Is the prince injured?

61
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,380
No.

62
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,620
Good.

63
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,620
Go find out

64
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,620
where the prince is.

65
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,700
Aye.

66
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,100
- Hurry!
- Aye, aye.

67
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,740
Your Majesty,

68
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,580
you have returned.

69
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,800
Why didn't you

70
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,420
notice me in advance?

71
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,740
So I could

72
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,900
usher you.

73
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,230
De Quan,

74
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,180
are you tired?

75
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,500
Yes.

76
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,260
All servants are tired.

77
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
But

78
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,340
it's my great honor

79
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,060
to serve you.

80
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,060
Serve me

81
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,580
