=Episode 2=

3
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,920
Noble Consort.

4
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,000
You mentioned cooperation.

5
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,560
You, too, want the emperor dead?

6
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,280
Why would I?

7
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,310
Then you lied to me.

8
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
Let's talk it out.

9
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Just nicely

10
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,040
talk it out.

11
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,040
If the emperor dies,

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,230
I'll be the consort dowager,

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,280
I'll enjoy a good life.

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
That's even better, no?

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,310
What makes you think
I'd believe you?

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,750
It's true.

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,400
You know,

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,400
before I became
a noble consort,

19
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,030
I had someone

20
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,840
that I loved,

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
but

22
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,080
regretfully,

23
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,870
our betrothal was canceled.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Once the emperor is dead,

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,000
I can be with my love.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,310
Or at least,

27
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,360
I can have some
nights with him,

28
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,710
that also pays off.

29
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,710
Woman.

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800
You are shameless.

31
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,800
Hey, you!

32
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,750
Don't touch my work.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,240
What is it?

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
It's a river lantern.

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,840
It's a nice-looking peach.

36
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a lotus flower.

37
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,910
It does look nice, right?

38
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,840
You're an interesting person.

39
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,870
With your lie-identifying ability.

40
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,120
And?

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Well,

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,590
we can cooperate.

43
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,470
On what?

44
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,630
We cooperate.

45
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,470
You help me kill the emperor.

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,310
I make your wish come true.

47
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,630
Shush.

48
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,560
Shush what?

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,150
You're too loud.

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,710
You're going to be heard.

51
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,590
And we'd

52
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,960
be decapitated.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,430
My lady,

54
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,630
I know what happened.

55
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,310
Open the door, my lady.

56
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,840
All right. I agree.

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
What do we do exactly?

58
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,310
Just follow my orders.

59
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,300
(Chun
Candle Palace Maid)

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,240
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,800
is it

62
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,950
something that I...

63
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,730
Nothing.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,340
When you're around,

65
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,190
I'd like to take
more looks at you.

66
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,790
I...

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm afraid it's too much.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,120
Rise.

69
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,830
Don't worry.

70
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,360
You saved my life,

71
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,600
so you deserve anything.

72
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,040
If you like,

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,630
I'll make you my concubine.

74
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
What?

75
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
I-I'll give the order now.

76
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,240
You'll keep an eye
on the emperor.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,870
Especially the ones
he sees in private.

78
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,430
But of course,

79
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,160
you'll keep him safe as well.

80
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,910
Do you understand?

81
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,950
Your Grace,

82
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,510
I just visited

83
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
Noble Consort Zhang,
Noble Consort Su

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,870
and Beauty Liu.

85
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,430
The emperor

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,510
swore off a number of consorts.

87
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,120
Each one of them
is from an important family.

88
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,270
Please advise

89
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,430
our next move.

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,480
The emperor

91
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,000
may seem harmless.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,750
All he reads are books
from the street.

93
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,350
But he has the gut
to act against me

94
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,390
by deposing
a group of consorts.

95
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,980
(Empress Dowager Dong)

96
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,310
His Majesty has promoted

97
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,390
the palace maid
who saved his life

98
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,000
to a Noble Woman.

99
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,120
What's your opinion?

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,310
I think

101
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,310
the attempted assassination
on His Majesty

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,190
is suspicious.

103
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,240
Everything that happened

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,270
after Prince of Ning An
returned...

105
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,720
Your Grace,

106
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,870
you must be cautious.

107
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,560
Humph.

108
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,750
To ferret out the assassin

109
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,710
isn't difficult.

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,310
It's just the emperor
made a radical decision

111
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,360
and took the liberty

112
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,160
to put General Su's daughter
under restraint.

113
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,800
Prince of Ning An has returned.

114
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
The situation

115
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,480
isn't looking good.

116
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,350
Right.

117
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,480
Your Grace,

118
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,870
I have prepared

119
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,480
for tomorrow.

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,400
Good.

121
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,560
I haven't seen

122
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,310
Prince of Ning An for ages.

123
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,910
