Hmm?

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,000
You should go home.

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Tomorrow.

7
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,380
Go home tomorrow.

8
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,480
What's wrong?

9
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,520
What happened?

10
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,470
Nothing.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,520
Everything's sorted.

12
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,710
I need to leave.

13
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,800
What about me?

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,680
You said...

15
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,080
It was then,

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,470
but now,

17
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,280
I don't want to marry you.

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
What do you mean?

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,140
Lu Huan,

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,860
turn to me.

21
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
Look me in the eyes

22
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,870
and say again.

23
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,400
I said,

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I don't want
to marry you anymore.

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
You go home tomorrow.

26
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,430
You're lying.

27
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,480
You say you'll go back
to the frontier.

28
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,870
The truth is,
you're going to war.

29
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,480
You're lying.

30
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
The six-kingdom coalition
is on the borderline.

31
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,270
You're lying.

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,950
You're going
to a tough war.

33
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,220
You're lying

34
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,870
I want me to be
with someone else.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Lu Huan,

36
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,530
but you forgot

37
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,580
that your lies
don't work on me.

38
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,190
Lu Huan,

39
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,560
I won't stop you,

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,600
but I'll wait for you
to come back.

41
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Don't worry.

42
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll live a good life.

43
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,190
I'll take care of myself.

44
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
I'll wait for you

45
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
to come back at the place

46
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,480
we met for the first time.

47

any news of Lu Huan?

Daughter,

105
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,580
come home with me,

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,900
okay?

when is your next operation?

110
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,020

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,040
His Majesty can't handle
everything on his own.

114
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,860
I write to Lu Huan every week.

115
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,770
Every single week.

116
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,360
But starting last month,

117
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,980
I haven't received
any letter from him.

118
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,540
Maybe

119
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,180
the courtier made a mistake.

I believe he will be found.

132
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,980
I promised him
