3
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,940
No point in denying anymore.

4
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,780
Your partner

5
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,980
has told everything

6
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,940
to keep himself alive.

7
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,620
You try to trick me?

8
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,620
Your information

9
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,260
is no longer

10
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,900
useful to me.

11
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm going to be dead

12
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,060
anyway,

13
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,620
so I'll tell you a secret.

14
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,500
Your mother,

15
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,660
she was murdered, right?

16
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,580
Do you know

17
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,500
who got her killed?

18
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,540
Your father,

19
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,780
the late emperor.

20
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,420
It's said

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,260
that your father

22
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,860
watched it happen.

23
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,340
The love of an emperor

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,100
must be cheap.

25
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,740
Your mother

26
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,100
bled to death

27
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,660
while your father watched.

28
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,620
She was in agony.

29
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,500
She was suffering.

30
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,660
I've heard that you

31
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,220
promoted a palace maid.

32
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,020
Why didn't you

33
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,540
take her to see me?

34
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,220
Mother,

35
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,330
um,

36
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,020
Noble Lady Chun
is having a cough.

37
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,140
I'm afraid she's got a cold.

38
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,620
She has to stay in room.

39
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,260
Is this what

40
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,020
perturbs you?

41
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,580
I told you, didn't I?

42
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,420
Don't waste your life
in the mushy romance.

43
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,180
Prince of Ning An has arrived.

44
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,740
No weapons allowed!

45
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,020
Prince of Ning An stayed
on the frontier for too long,

46
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,820
he's more casual

47
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,460
than the rest of us.

48
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:49,980
Mother,

49
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
well,

50
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,620
he was away from
the capital city for long,

51
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,540
it's normal
that he acts casually.

52
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,500
You should

53
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,420
take some weight

54
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,420
off his shoulder.

55
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,780
It's just...

56
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,380
It isn't safe in the city.

57
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,260
Some street rumors

58
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,940
are quite disturbing.

59
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,660
Rumors on the street

60
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,620
accuse me of rebellion.

61
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,420
So you set up this banquet
and invited me

62
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,300
as a demonstration of harmony

63
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,660
and stability.

64
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,660
It isn't a big deal.

65
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,340
The capital city

66
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,260
hasn't received
non-imperial troops for ages.

67
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,740
It's normal that rumors
and fear arise.

68
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,060
It must have been not easy

69
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,140
for you to fight
enemies out there.

70
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,260
Now that you have returned,

71
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,500
you may stay
in the capital city.

72
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,420
I came back

73
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,300
to deal with
a personal business.

74
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,620
Your mother's
death anniversary.

75
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,740
I remember

76
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,220
your mother...

77
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,340
Your Majesty,

78
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
I have some other business.

79
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,340
I must excuse myself.

80
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
OK.

81
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,380
Your Grace,

82
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,180
your health comes first.

83
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,580
Prince of Ning An

84
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
has power in hand.

85
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Please kindly allow

86
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,300
his occasional insolence.

87
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,580
Hmm.

88
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,900
The emperor is weak.

89
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,900
He isn't my biological son.

90
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,940
He indulges himself

91
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,260
in entertainment and romance.

92
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,220
General Su stays low-profile.

93
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,580
Now that Prince
of Ning An has returned,

94
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,540
in the long run,

95
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,220
it brings hazard to the throne.

96
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,580
Imagine

97
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,260
if General Su

98
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,020
honored the agreement

99
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,940
with Prince of Ning An, then...

100
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,220
Thankfully,

101
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,420
you helped me
eliminate the risk.

102
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,180
It's my privilege.

103
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,740
He isn't

104
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,260
one in your clan,

105
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,980
so he cannot
be on your side.

106
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,780
Your Grace,

107
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,820
you must take precautions
against him.

108
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,260
At the time,

109
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,620
I put him in the throne

110
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,980
because I had no choice.

111
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,700
I didn't expect that...

112
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,860
Alas.

113
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,420
The emperor
is a disappointment.

114
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,860
Prince of Ning An

115
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,220
is beyond control.

116
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,140
But the two of them

117
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,540
were close
when they were younger.

118
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,140
Had it not been
for the incident,

119
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
they...

120
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,900
Your Grace,

121
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
what I mean is,

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,260
it may be the time

123
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,740
for you

124
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,420
to put someone
from a side branch

125
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,340
in the palace.

126
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,860
Dear Father,

127
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,100
I hope the letter
finds you well.

128
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,500
As I'm writing this letter,

129
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,780
I'm still breathing,

130
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,620
but still confined
in my chamber.

131
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,620
Yet I'm safe

132
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,500
and well-fed.

133
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,460
If things go smoothly,

134
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
I'll be at home

135
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,020
by the third day
of the next month.

136
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,220
But if not,

137
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,060
I will

138
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,700
pay your love back
in my next life.

139
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,820
Your Highness.

140
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,020
Your Highness.

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,860
I have told you endless times.

142
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,220
Be steady.

143
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,420
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,020
But this is really urgent.

145
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,820
Speak.

146
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,580
A few days ago,

147
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,780
the empress talked
to some of

148
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,700
her distant relatives.

149
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,340
As if the emperor doesn't exist.

150
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,860
The empress thinks

151
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,060
the emperor has grown up

152
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,620
and become difficult to control.

153
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,700
And she knows
since we grew up together,

154
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,460
the scale of power
may lose balance.

155
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,220
But His Majesty indulges
himself in romance

156
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,180
without managing
the political affairs.

157
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,900
It's not for you to judge.

158
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,380
I don't know
what His Majesty is thinking.

159
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
The empress has eyes everywhere.

160
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,500
Noble Consort Su

161
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,540
may be of use.

162
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,540
No! No!

163
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,420
My lady, you had
another nightmare.

164
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,140
I'm okay.
