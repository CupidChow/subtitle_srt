3
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,180
Stand there!

4
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,140
Stop!

5
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,300
Get back!

6
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,060
Stop!

7
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,780
Stop running!

8
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,660
- Stop!
- Stop!

9
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,540
Get back!

10
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,860
Stop!

11
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,820
Stop running!

12
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,460
Don't be afraid.

13
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,660
It's me.

14
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,660
Don't look back.

15
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
It's you.

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,820
Take me to the prince.

17
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,980
To the prince!

18
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,170
The prince, to the prince...

19
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,060
My lord,

20
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,340
Chun is awake.

21
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
She's okay.

22
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,020
Gu is kneeing out there

23
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,180
to show his apology.

24
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,780
You came in
without knocking.

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,340
Sorry, my lord.

26
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,560
Ask the kitchen

27
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,860
to make some medicinal food.

28
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,460
Also,

29
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,660
your outfit.

30
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,280
We've prepared a new set.

31
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,010
Leave it there.

32
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,380
Aye.

33
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,630
You're awake.

34
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,620
How do you feel?

35
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,180
What are you doing here?

36
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,340
Did you save my life?

37
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,140
You helped me
find the prince?

38
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,020
How is Sister Chun doing?

39
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,540
Chun?

40
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,660
She's resting next door.

41
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,140
She's safe.

42
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,600
Don't worry.

43
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,820
Good to know.

44
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,340
For what it's worth,

45
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,660
starting today,

46
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,780
you're my lifesaver.

47
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,100
If you need me
to do anything,

48
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,590
just ask.

49
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,060
Your new life,

50
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,500
I promise you'll have it.

51
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,220
If you're in trouble,

52
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,900
I'll help you
even at the cost of my life.

53
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,150
OK.

54
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,900
Noted.

55
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
My lord, the medicine is ready.

56
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,780
Oh, actually.

57
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,260
I don't know your name yet.

58
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,420
My prince,

59
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,940
you asked me
to fix my error,

60
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
I've know who they are.

61
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,100
Guess what?

62
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
Prince?

63
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,540
Prince?

64
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,390
Mother,

65
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,260
I have always respected you.

66
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,160
But now I'm in power,

67
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,870
it's a felony that you
interfere with my ruling.

68
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,620
Felony?

69
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,140
Emperor, have you forgotten

70
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,310
who led you

71
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,370
to the throne
from the entrance

72
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,390
step by step?

73
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,280
I was young and simple.

74
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,610
I'm grateful
for your instructions.

75
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,640
But now

76
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,330
it's time for you to retire.

77
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
Putting distant relatives
in important positions

78
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,730
was transgression of power.

79
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,020
- So...
- But don't you worry,

80
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,060
I have that sorted out.

81
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,180
The landscapes are nice
outside the frontier,

82
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,140
a much better place

83
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,930
than the imperial palace.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,700
- You!
- Since you

85
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,710
miss the old days

86
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,440
with me in the hall,

87
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,770
you may stay here
for a while longer.

88
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,980
I

89
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,300
shall be off.

90
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,380
You...

91
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,260
You're good.

92
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,740
(Clothing Shop)
Novelties.

93
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,540
- Accessories.
- Vegetables for sale.

94
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,760
- Su Qin.
- Fresh vegetables.

95
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,660
Stop following me.

96
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Come and see.

97
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
Su Qin, listen to me, please.

98
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,340
I don't want to hear it.

99
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,340
Rouge.

100
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,500
Premium rouge.

101
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,380
Su Qin.

102
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,580
Take a look.

103
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,460
Please listen to me.

104
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,060
I didn't mean
to lie to you.

105
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
You knew you were lying, huh?

106
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,980
Was it fun to treat me
like a fool?

107
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,180
You enjoyed it when I said
I loved the prince.

108
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,500
Hey, miss.

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,860
It amused you, didn't it?

110
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,660
Actually I...

111
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,820
I'm worried
about your safety

112
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,940
and your future every day.

113
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,720
I spent so much effort
on you.

114
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,740
Was it fun to fool me around?

115
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,420
My lie-detection ability

116
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,020
doesn't work on you.

117
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,820
Good for you,
Prince of Ning An.

118
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,580
Rouge.

119
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm aware that you're
worried about me.

120
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,590
- Rouge.
- I'm fully aware.

121
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,100
But I don't know
how to explain

122
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,660
other than saying
sorry right now.

123
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,140
I know I hurt your feelings.

124
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,740
I admit that I lied to you.

125
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,820
You can tell me off.
You can beat me.

126
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,500
Beat you?

127
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,340
You think I wouldn't dare?

128
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,780
You know lies
hurt one's feelings, huh?

129
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,420
You hate liars,

130
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,180
but you are a big liar.

131
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,780
You know everything,

132
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,740
but you treated me
like an idiot.

133
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,940
Su Qin.

134
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,860
Let's talk it out.

135
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,260
Nothing to talk about.

136
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,030
Hey.

137
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,900
Hey, miss!

138
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,540
Thank you
for saving my life.

139
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,220
I owe you.

140
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,420
Don't follow me.

141
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,050
Miss, that's mine.

142
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,820
Right.

143
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,060
I've become a man
that I hate.

144
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Huh?

145
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,500
Ah, thanks, sir.

146
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
So...

147
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,130
So much money.

148
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,060
Have another fight!

149
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,140

again at my stand!
