00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,590
They passed my sift.

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,350
Please review, my lord.

5
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,790
Ai yah.

6
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,310
Chubby boy.

7
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,380
Tender and clean.

8
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,660
Pinky cheeks.

9
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,940
Where are you from?

10
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,060
My lord.

11
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,460
I'm from the Jiangnan region.

12
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,180
Oh, Jiangnan region.

13
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Do you know a Su?

14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,300
No.

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,540
Oh.

16
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,660
Does any of you

17
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,900
know a Su?

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,620
No.

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,620
Noble Consort Su

20
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,960
is quite sneaky.

21
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,500
Kill them all.

22
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,660
Huh?

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,020
No, no, no.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,780
Sister,

25
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
it's late.

26
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,900
Ready to go?

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,580
OK.

28
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,660
Coming.

29
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,260
Sister,

30
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,260
what's for breakfast?

31
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,540
Your Highness,

32
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,060
the path is clear.

33
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,940
But why do we have to

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,220
do the after-cleaning?

35
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,820
You do what you're told.

36
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,700
Keep your mouth shut.

37
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,820
Aye.

38
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,060
Yay!

39
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,660
Yay!

40
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,710
Yay!

41
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,890
Yay!

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,740
Yay!

43
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
Yay!

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,620
Sister Chun,

45
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,700
get over it.

46
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,140
It's a big world.

47
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,660
There are tons
of good men out there.

48
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,980
Am I right?

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,860
You're right.

50
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,660
But there's something

51
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,940
that you don't understand.

52
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,140
Now that we are both out,

53
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,620
I'll take good care of you.

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,540
OK.

55
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,450
You, too.

56
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,550
Oh, yes.

57
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,680
The imperial order.

58
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,300
You hurried out that night,

59
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,840
I couldn't catch up
with you.

60
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,410
You should keep it.

61
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,180
You mustn't

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,700
lose it,

63
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,260
or you'll be executed.

64
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,260
If you don't want to see it,

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,780
find a secret location

66
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,940
and hide it.

67
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,820
Out of sight, out of mind.

68
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,980
Right, right, right.

69
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,980
Oh.

70
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,340
My bad. My bad.

71
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,340
Oh, dear.

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,420
Dear sister.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Now, now.

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,220
Plenty of good men
out there.

75
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,420
Get over him.

76
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,100
Sir.

77
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,620
What's up, miss?

78
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,860
Nothing.

79
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,860
I'll go see
if there's any food.

80
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,620
Sister Chun.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,540
Wait here.

82
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,420
OK.

83
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,300
- What is this place?
- Where are we?

84
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,860
- Where is it?
- Where are they?

85
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,420
We go get some rest.

86
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,460
Yeah, let's go.

87
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,700
Where are the actors

88
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,940
sent by the emperor?

89
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,140
I'm stuck with her

90
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,580
if they don't show up.

91
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,940
And I can't go home.

92
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,540
Ugh.

93
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,060
Where are the bandits?

94
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,660
This is Anyang City.

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,020
But where are we?

96
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,500
Boss,

97
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,620
I think this is where we are.

98
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
Here.

99
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,480
Dongyang Forest.

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,220
No, no.

101
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,300
We are in Xiyang Forest.

102
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,140
We are here.

103
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
No, no.

104
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,620
We are in Dongyang Forest.

105
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,980
- No, no. Xiyang.
- No, no, no.

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,980
What's the matter with you?

107
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,100
Are you the ones?

108
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,190
All right, follow me.

109
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,940
- Let's wrap it up.
- Let's follow her.

110
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,160
- Go.
- Huh?

111
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,420
When you kidnap the driver,

112
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
be easy on him.

113
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,860
He knows nothing.

114
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,380
And when you kidnap Chun,

115
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,300
be extra careful.

116
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,180
Got it?

117
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,980
All right. Follow me.

118
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
Hey, Sister.

119
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,380
Who are these people?

120
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,860
Boss, is she the one?

121
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,260
They are...

122
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,140
Boss,

123
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,420
not her.

124
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,910
Hey.

125
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
I think Lord De Quan
mentioned her.

126
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,620
Be careful.

127
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,700
It may be a trick.

128
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,220
Who are you?

129
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,420
Wait, you...

130
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,620
I said, "be easy on him."

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,820
Who are they?

132
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,060
They are...

133
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,100
Bandits.

134
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,940
Liang Mountain.

135
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,900
Hu.

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,460
You hit me too hard.

137
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,740
Mr. Hu from Liang Mountain, huh?

138
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,620
All right.
you'll be punished for it.

139
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,700
You think it's a joke?

140
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,550
Huh?

141
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,540
Go.

142
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,940
Wait, no!

143
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,780
I almost forgot
I'm a warrior.

144
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,300
Sister...

145
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,180
Don't move.

146
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,100
Or I'll cut her throat.

147
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,220
Nasty jerk.

148
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,180
You're shameless.

149
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,420
Get up. Get up.

150
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,460
That woman who fights,

151
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,300
tie her up.

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,140
Be good.

153
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,140
Boss,

154
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,180
she's a beauty.

155
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,460
It's a shame
if she becomes a dead body.

156
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,660
How about

157
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,940
we have some fun

158
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,340
before killing her?

159
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,460
Don't move!

160
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,580
Ahh!

161
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,980
Don't move.

162
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,940
Su Qin!

163
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,580
Good.

164
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,980
You like this?

165
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,940
Well, let's play this tonight.

166
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Tie this one up as well.

167
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
- Su Qin!
- Sister!

168
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,340
- No! You...
- Move.

169
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,620
- You...
- Move.

170
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,860
Cheers.

171
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,540
What is this cheap stuff?

172
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,540
You bought it?

173
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,660
Yeah.

174
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,540
Right.

175
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,980
A few days later,

176
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,570
Lord De will pay us.

177
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,900
You can have

178
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,940
anything you want.

179
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,460
Su Qin, listen to me.

180
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,980
Listen to every word
I say carefully.

181
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,460
You'll run along the path.

182
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,460
If you meet anyone,
ask to see the prince.

183
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,540
What about you?

184
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,700
I can't leave you here alone.

185
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,740
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

186
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,620
I'll stall them.

187
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,940
- Go. Go.
- OK.

188
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,780
- Just go.
- OK.

189
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,620
Go see the prince.

190
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,380
Go.

191
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,540
Let's go check up on them.

192
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,420
Go.

193
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,700
It can't go wrong.

194
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Go, go.

195
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,340
Wait.

196
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
