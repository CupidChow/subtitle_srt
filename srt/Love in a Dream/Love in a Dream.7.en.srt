3
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,480
Do you know
who my father is?

4
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,400
The General-in-chief
of Dacheng.

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,510
He's great.

6
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
It shouldn't
be difficult for him

7
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,590
to put you in a position.

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,200
If you want to join the army,

9
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,900
you can serve under him.

10
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,100
If you want
to be in the palace,

11
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,180
he'll get you a job.

12
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,420
No, no.

13
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,460
You may die in a war.

14
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,780
It's nice to be a guard.

15
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,300
Are you...

16
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,580
Worried about me?

17
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,460
Yes, I am.

18
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,380
We've only met
a few times,

19
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,900
but I think

20
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,260
you are good in nature.

21
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,620
Good?

22
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,780
Yes.

23
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,810
I know

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,260
what's the best job for you.

25
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,500
What?

26
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,860
It's a secret.

27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
But trust me,

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,940
it is totally safe.

29
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,980
You want access
to the imperial palace?

30
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,780
I'll give you

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,730
a job that comes
with free access.

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,700
Just you wait for me.

33
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,500
OK.

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,100
I'll wait for your message.

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,620
After you change your life,

36
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,340
your will no longer
live on the edge.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,420
And you can think about

38
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,780
what a life to live.

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,140
You eat and sleep every day.

40
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,220
Peaceful and carefree.

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,780
So that

42
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,900
you can put all your past

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,500
behind you.

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,180
And when you look back,

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,780
the hate between you

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,940
and the emperor

47
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,580
isn't that big of a deal.

48
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,980
Why must you

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,380
risk your future?

50
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,060
OK.

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,020
It's a deal, then.

52
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,220
A deal?

53
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,980
What deal?

54
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,400
After the job is done,

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,180
you'll be with me.

56
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,660
With you?

57
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,440
You don't understand
what I was saying, do you?

58
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,020
Hey, wait. You...

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,170
You should listen
with attention!

60
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,860
Would it work?

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,140
Lord De Quan,

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,500
I've been expecting you.

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,660
Ai yah.

64
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,300
Noble Consort Su.

65
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,450
Greetings, my lady.

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Why do you want
to see me?

67
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,420
Why don't I?

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,980
I want to

69
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,820
ask you for a favor.

70
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,780
Do tell.

71
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,180
When new recruits come,

72
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,660
can I add one?

73
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,260
No, no, no.

74
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,060
That can't be done.

75
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,700
No vacancies.

76
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,700
Nonsense.

77
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,780
The recruitment

78
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,260
of this season
hasn't even started.

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,180
But I...

80
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,540
Lord De,

81
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,740
the one I want to add

82
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,660
is nice-looking

83
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,940
and smart.

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,780
You'll like him.

85
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,580
For real?

86
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,900
My lord.

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,020
I... My lady...

88
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,980
It-It's...

89
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,380
I understand.

90
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,220
My lord,

91
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,980
please make
some arrangements.

92
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,720
My lady,

93
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,460
it isn't necessary.

94
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,100
But I see.
I understand.

95
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,420
My lord, I'll be off.

96
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,500
See you, my lady.

97
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,220
Go.

98
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Chun.

99
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,060
I ordered

100
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,020
the imperial kitchen

101
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,020
to develop

102
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,180
the osmanthus cakes.

103
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,300
Try one.

104
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,340
See if you like it.

105
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,020
What?

106
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,140
A bit too sweet.

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,700
I don't want to get fat.

108
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,500
Ah.

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,870
It's...

110
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,680
It's my bad.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,680
It's the first time
I made it,

112
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,740
I didn't know
how much sugar to add.

113
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,860
I thought

114
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,000
good things come in pair.

115
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,100
So I added two spoons.

116
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,690
You made these?

117
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Oh.

118
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,500
Give it to me.

119
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,420
I'm terrible at this.

120
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,700
I...

121
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,860
I didn't think of it.

122
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,180
But

123
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,330
I kneaded the dough.

124
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,000
It was clean.

125
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,980
What made you

126
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,620
want to make dessert for me?

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
I've heard

128
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,760
common folks make desserts

129
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,820
for their family

130
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,180
on their birthday.

131
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,860
That's how they
sweeten their lives.

132
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,340
So

133
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,300
I had an imperial cook

134
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,580
teach me the recipe.

135
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,930
But I blew it up.

136
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,230
Birthday?

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,420
Is it my birthday today?

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,980
I totally forgot about it.

139
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,610
It's fine.

140
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,630
I'll celebrate every
birthday of yours

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
with you in the future.

142
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,060
You may forget it,

143
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,860
but I'll remember.

144
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,800
I'll have it.

145
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,780
You...

146
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,220
You can't just come in
like this.

147
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,930
