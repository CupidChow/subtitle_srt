=Episode 22=

3
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,840
Your Majesty,

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,510
you have returned.

5
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,790
Why didn't you

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,150
notice me in advance?

7
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,710
So I could

8
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,680
usher you.

9
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,150
De Quan,

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,200
are you tired?

11
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,550
Yes.

12
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,350
All servants are tired.

13
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,960
But

14
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,590
it's my great honor

15
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,430
to serve you.

16
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,080
Serve me

17
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,080
or Prince of Guazhou?

18
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,990
Your Majesty,

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,630
I have served you

20
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,120
for twenty years,

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
but

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm a son of Guazhou.

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
My life for my master.

24
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,360
Your prince

25
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,430
is doomed.

26
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,310
Your revitalization dream

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
has crumbled.

28
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,240
My liege!

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,000
I

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,560
have done my best!

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Soldiers.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,710
Put De Quan

33
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,280
in prison.

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Aye.

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,630
Your Majesty!

36
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,240
The six-kingdom coalition
has crossed the borderline!

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,750
You take care!

38
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,080
Take care!

39
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,350
You're awake.

40
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,750
How do you feel now?

41
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,270
Feeling okay?

42
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,190
I'll go get Gu here.

43
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,270
- What?
- Don't go.

44
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,360
OK.

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,630
I won't leave.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,270
I'll stay here with you.

47
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,270
Need more rest?

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,270
This

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,310
will be your
handicraft workshop.

50
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,710
This

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,390
will be where you
make the food.

52
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,430
- OK.
- And this room.

53
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,190
Whatever you want it to be,

54
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,630
I'll make it happen.

55
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,710
OK.

56
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,680
You make the call.

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Huh?

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
It's...

59
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,480
It's my river lantern.

60
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,000
It's pretty good.

61
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,510
Ohh.

62
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,390
I was wondering
why one was missing,

63
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,600
so you took it.

64
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,430
If you want anything,

65
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,190
just tell me

66
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
and I'll make it for you.

67
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,910
Mmh?

68
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,480
What's wrong?

69
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,190
Something on my face?

70
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,670
Hmm?

71
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,950
Su Qin,

72
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,120
that day

73
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,040
on the battlefield,

74
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,680
I was nearly killed.

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,310
Don't say that.

76
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,240
What I mean is,

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,870
I survived because of you.

78
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,720
I had the scene

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,510
of us talking
under the candle light

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,190
in my head,

81
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,110
so

82
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,420
I fought my way back
to realize it.

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,190
Su Qin,

84
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,760
marry me.

85
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,750
OK.

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,440
I will marry no one

87
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,190
but you.

88
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
My lord!

89
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,680
His Majesty wishes
to see Prince of Ning An.

90
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,950
I need to see the emperor.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
You wait for me at home.

92
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,870
I'll be quick.

93
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,910
OK.

94
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,480
But you aren't
fully recovered.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,840
It's okay.

96
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,870
Be quick.

97
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,540
The empress dowager wishes
to see Noble Consort Su.

98
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,790
Noble Consort Su,

99
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,510
do you
acknowledge your crime?

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,270
Your Grace,

101
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,670
what crime?

102
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Insolence!

103
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,670
You and your father

104
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,550
deceived the emperor

105
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,670
and Prince of Ning An.

106
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,870
You tricked the emperor
into killing De Quan.

107
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,150
Luckily, I was vigilant enough

108
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,320
to discover

109
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,360
your scheme.

110
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,300
Your Grace,

111
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,830
aren't you good at
framing people up?

112
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,080
You again.

113
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,670
I knew the impure lineage

114
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,600
couldn't be trusted.

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,870
We shall achieve unification.

116
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,840
Lineage will matter no more.

117
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
Where are the imperial guards?

118
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,200
Why do you summon
the imperial guards, Mother?

119
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,270
When I was young,

120
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,720
you put me in the throne.

121
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,360
I thought about

122
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
living a carefree life,

123
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,840
but I can't.

124
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,750
When I'm in the throne,

125
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,670
I want a stable
political situation

126
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,440
and the unification
of all kingdoms.

127
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,750
From today on,

128
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,270
you will enjoy

129
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,390
a carefree life, Mother.

130
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
This time,

131
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,120
you are not needed.

132
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,670
His Majesty has taken power

133
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,870
and I've made
an arrangement for you.

134
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,910
Your Highness,

135
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,030
do you really
not need us?

136
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,030
It'll be a perilous operation.

137
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
And

138
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,120
you've served me
long enough.

139
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,550
When I pledged
my allegiance to you,

140
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
I swore

141
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,240
I'd die for you.

142
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,550
You'll put yourself
in danger,

143
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,390
how can we
stay in the city?

144
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,490
