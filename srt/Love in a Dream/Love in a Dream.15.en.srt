00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Why

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,510
do you buy this for me?

5
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,510
You were looking at it,
weren't you?

6
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,710
Your Lovers' Cakes.

7
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,570
It wasn't
because you like it?

8
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,710
I do.

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,140
I like it.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,400
If you like something,
say it out.

11
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,890
Hey, waiter.

12
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,430
Why is it so lively
on the street today?

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,710
It's a traditional festival
of ours,

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
similar to Qixi Festival.

15
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,980
The street is full of couples.

16
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,700
And the Lovers' Cake

17
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,140
is only sold on this day.

18
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,140
Oh.

19
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,420
Are you not from here?

20
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,700
It's a good chance.

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,300
You may hang around.

22
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
Have some fun.

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,820
Call me if you need anything.

24
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,860
OK.

25
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,260
You

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,020
finished eating already?

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,980
Are you hungry?

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
I like it.

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,920
Oh, okay.

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,540
Sugar-coated haws.

31
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,100
Sugar-coated haws.

32
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,540
- Sir.
- Hey.

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,900
I'll take one.

34
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,940
Sure.

35
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,300
Take it.

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,540
Okay.

37
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,540
Thank you, sir.

38
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,420
Thank you, sir.

39
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

40
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,500
Where's mine?

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,660
Huh?

42
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,500
You want one, too?

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,420
- Sir, please...
- Hey.

44
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,700
Forget it.

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,780
I think

46
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,740
yours is good.

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,700
Huh?

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,180
Hey.

49
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,220
You...

50
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,740
Vegetables.

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,220
Fresh vegetables.

52
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,700
Take a look.

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,220
Good rouge for sale.

54
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,900
It seems fun out here.

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,180
How about

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,740
we hang around?

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,300
OK.

58
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,420
Let's hang around.

59
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
Sigh.

60
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,180
Miss, take a look.

61
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,260
Here's your money.

62
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,620
See you around.

63
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,300
Has anyone prepared
a surprise for you?

64
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,260
Surprise?

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,940
No surprise.

66
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,820
More like scare.

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,140
Scare?

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,100
Who did that?

69
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,740
It isn't important.

70
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,500
What important is,

71
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,020
what are you thinking
right now?

72
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,500
I...

73
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,100
I've never chosen
a present for anyone.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,700
Choose something you like.

75
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
I choose?

76
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,460
Would Gu like

77
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,300
the same thing I like?

78
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,340
What are you talking about?

79
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,620
Nothing. Nothing.

80
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,660
I mean

81
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,500
okay,

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,220
I've got good taste.

83
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,220
Let's go.

84
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,340
I choose, you pay.

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,100
Whoa.

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,420
Do you like them?

87
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,340
I do.

88
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,380
Buy them all.

89
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,100
I've got money.

90
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,020
Gosh.

91
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,620
How am I supposed to know

92
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,580
what Gu likes?

93
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,940
Take a look at this.

94
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,020
This one.

95
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,980
- Shopkeeper.
- Huh?

96
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,180
Pack everything
and deliver

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,900
them to the mansion
near the city gates.

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,740
The receiver is Mr. Lu.

99
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,220
No problem.

100
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,860
Sir, your wife has good taste.

101
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,500
All she chooses
are high-end stuff.

102
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,220
Don't worry about the delivery.

103
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Not wife yet.

104
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,700
Oh, I see. I see.

105
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,570
After everything's ready,

106
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,700
this wedding robe,

107
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,460
I'll give you a 20% discount.

108
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,860
I knew it.

109
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,140
Rings must come in pairs.

110
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,060
Sister Chun was right.

111
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,900
You are a fine man.

112
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
Is that so?

113
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,740
You are meticulous

114
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,660
and thoughtful.

115
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,140
Those who like you

116
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,860
will like you more.

117
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,700
Those who don't

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,420
will be swayed.

119
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,100
But I don't think

120
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,020
I'm good enough.

121
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,300
It's because

122
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,860
the situation you're in

123
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,220
is uncommon.

124
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,500
It is trickier.

125
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,180
Take it easy.

126
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
And slowly.

127
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,020
I'll clear all obstacles.

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,300
Even if it's unconventional.

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,420
From your perspective,

130
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,060
what else can you give

131
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,740
to show your resolution?

132
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,700
Wealth and fame.

133
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,020
House and carriage.

134
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,980
I can give all of those.

135
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,380
But to show my sincerity,

136
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,660
is me myself good enough?

137
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,750
Yes, yes.

138
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,140
Good enough.

139
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,780
R-Really?

140
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,320
Really.

141
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,340
Good enough.

142
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,580
You only need
to take one last step.

143
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,900
How about a night together?

144
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,340
Uh...

145
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,220
A-A night together?

146
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,580
It-It's a bit too soon.

147
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,180
Mutually attracted.

148
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Sooner rather than later, no?

149
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,500
With one more day delayed,

150
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,140
more love is delayed.

151
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,260
But...

152
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,140
I know what you're
worried about.

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,340
Morality and ethics,

154
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,620
how people see you,

155
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,620
and the feelings of your family.

156
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,100
Your love relationship

157
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,380
is a bit unorthodox

158
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,100
and difficult.

159
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,220
But so what?

160
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Life is short.

161
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,740
Why not be brave

162
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,620
and go for it?

163
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,580
What's more...

164
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,740
Sigh.

165
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,420
It's best that...

166
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,380
You hold your love
in your own hand.

167
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,980
Su Qin,

168
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,700
you are right.

169
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,700
I've served under him
for 15 years.

170
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
It was good between us

171
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,220
before you appeared.

172
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,980
But ever since
you entered his life,

173
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,500
he has never been
satisfied with us.

174
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,660
You and the prince,

175
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,260
and Yuelian...

176
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,510
Are the three of you...

177
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,260
Yes.

178
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,380
Yes. We all are.

179
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,820
Our happiness

180
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,220
for the rest of our lives

181
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
is counting on you.

182
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,620
Sir,

183
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,740
it's a treasure of the shop.

184
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,140
Excellent choice.

185
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,180
I've brought it here.

186
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,180
Try it on.

187
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,900
It is of premium quality.

188
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,340
The girl with you earlier.

189
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,580
She's your loved one,
isn't she?

190
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,700
She...

191
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Mutually attracted.

192
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Sooner rather than later, no?

193
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,540
With one more day delayed,

194
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,420
more love is delayed.

195
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,860
You only need
to take one last step.

196
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,580
