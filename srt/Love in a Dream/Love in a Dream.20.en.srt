3
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,790
I'm innocent.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,250
I'm innocent!

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,510
I'm innocent!

6
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,480
Have mercy.

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,560
Have mercy, please!

8
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,150
Have mercy!

9
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,190
Have mercy.

10
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Your Majesty.

11
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
Uncle,

12
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,080
I should go back.

13
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,310
Your Majesty,

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,310
you should.

15
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Uncle, you keep going,

16
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
General Su will meet you
in the front.

17
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,150
Prince of Guazhou
cannot be traced.

18
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,310
He mistook you for me,

19
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,000
on your next journey,

20
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,800
you be careful, Uncle.

21
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,870
Your Majesty,

22
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,190
I have yet another request.

23
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,190
It's about Su Qin, isn't it?

24
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,400
I'll take her back

25
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
and she can go home.

26
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
When you're back,

27
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,280
I'll grant your marriage.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
Your Majesty,

29
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,590
I...

30
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,870
I gave Chun a promise.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,950
Do you

32
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,040
have something

33
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,240
to say to me?

34
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,630
You saved me again.

35
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,360
You risked your life
getting me out of danger

36
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,560
and you defended me
against the emperor.

37
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,510
You love me,

38
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
don't you?

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm curious, though.

40
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
When did you fall
in love with me?

41
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,610
I...

42
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,240
I don't know.

43
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,430
How do you
not know that?

44
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,310
You're fooling me again.

45
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,160
The first time I met you,

46
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,560
it was in the imperial palace

47
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,480
and you were frightened,

48
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,430
but you still rattled on.

49
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,040
After that,

50
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,510
every time I met you,

51
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,630
it would feel like

52
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,920
a fire was burning
in my heart.

53
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,040
I guess God felt bad
about my loneliness,

54
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
so you and I met each other.

55
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,480
You didn't lie to me.

56
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,190
And it's true
that you can detect lies.

57
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,590
So

58
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,630
I guess I'm blessed.

59
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
You don't lie to me,

60
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,630
you even

61
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
catch others in a lie.

62
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
You are

63
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,920
God's gift for me.

64
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,560
But I lied.

65
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,800
The assassination attempt
on the emperor,

66
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,510
my love for
Prince of Ning An,

67
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,630
those weren't real.

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
When faced with danger,

69
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,800
you'd act on instinct.

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
If I had been honest,

71
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,310
you wouldn't have lied.

72
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,040
In a word,

73
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,750
it was my fault.

74
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200
Su Qin,

75
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,080
Lu Huan,

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
thank you.

78
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,390
For what?

79
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,720
For understanding me.

80
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,750
For not judging me.

81
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,720
With the emperor,

82
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,720
my special ability

83
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,830
got myself in trouble.

84
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,390
I had no idea

85
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,270
what Lord De Quan was like,

86
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,320
nor did I know
Guazhou's situation.

87
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,790
But when I was there,

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
listening to their talk,

89
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,200
I couldn't control myself.

90
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,440
I know.

91
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,510
But we do need to

92
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,150
investigate Lord De Quan.

93
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
Don't worry.

94
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,200
I'll do that.

95
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,600
For all these years,

96
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,600
everybody says
I'm a mistake,

97
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,790
that I'm a trouble-maker,

98
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,790
Including my parents

99
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,480
and sisters.

100
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,150
But I understand,

101
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,200
they just don't want trouble.

102
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
You're

103
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
the first one

104
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,390
who stood up for me.

105
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,510
Thank you, Lu Huan.

106
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
You didn't doubt me.

107
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,750
You weren't afraid.

108
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,120
Su Qin,

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,960
marry me.

110
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,390
