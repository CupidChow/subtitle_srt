=Episode 6=

3
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,760
Don't go.

4
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,040
I can't live without you.

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,590
For you,

6
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,710
I'd give up anything.

7
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,000
Why do you treat
me so coldly?

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,840
I...

9
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,790
It isn't the life I want.

10
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm just an ordinary girl.

11
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,950
Since I was a child,

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,790
I have dreamed

13
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,430
to be with someone

14
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,310
that I love.

15
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,850
A loving couple

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,850
lives a simple life together.

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,710
With me,

18
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,030
Your wish can be fulfilled.

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,910
You're the emperor,

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,750
you must have a harem.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,710
No matter how much
you love me,

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
your love will still be

23
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,150
shared among

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
other concubines and consorts.

25
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,150
All right.

26
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,280
I'll kick them out.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,310
That will do it.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Honestly,

29
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,000
we all are poor souls

30
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,680
in the harem.

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,000
Their lives cannot be ruined

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
because of our love.

33
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,520
Plus,

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,150
I have my own difficulties.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Come on.

36
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,840
Because I'm the emperor,

37
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,120
I don't deserve

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,400
to be with someone I love?

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,420
You do. You do.

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,300
You certainly do.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
Your Majesty,

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
it's...

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,310
You guys carry on.

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm off.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
Stand there.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
Who are you?

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
it's me.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,710
Who?

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,590
I'm Noble Consort Su.

52
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,540
Noble Consort Su?

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,710
You snitched
on Noble Consort Zhang

54
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,710
and the Chariot General?

55
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,120
Yes, yes, yes.

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,120
That was me.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
I didn't expect you
to remember me.

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,360
Lucky me.

59
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,930
Yes.

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,400
It's self-aware of you

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
for not trying
to steal me.

62
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,120
It's true
that I don't like you.

63
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,000
To me, you...

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,430
Just shut up!

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,490
Come here.

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,590
Chun,

67
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,750
you said
you had no friend before.

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,640
Now,

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,870
this one, I don't like.

70
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,620
You can make friends
with her.

71
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,370
So you won't feel bored
in the palace.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,750
Sister,

73
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,090
do you mind?

74
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,030
Sister,

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,600
I always wanted

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,190
to make friends with you.

77
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,590
Mmm.

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,240
Good.

79
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,360
Your Majesty,

80
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,680
about Noble Consort Su's
escape last night.

81
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,270
I think

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,070
someone's giving
her instructions.

83
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,950
Or someone is

84
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,360
delivering messages for her.

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,750
Think about it.

86
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,070
Noble Consort Su is young,

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,390
playful,

88
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,720
so it's normal

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
that she got controlled.

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,600
I see.

91
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,120
This thing must

92
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,870
be kept a secret

93
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,040
in case
of unwanted attention.

94
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,160
You will

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,430
dig more information.

96
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,270
Aye.

97
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,040
Prince of Ning An
requests for a meeting.

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,080
Granted.

99
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,870
Now.

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Prince of Ning An,
you may see His Majesty.

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,400
Uncle,

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,360
I summoned you

103
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,430
because I need
your instructions.

104
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
Do tell, Your Majesty.

105
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,160
I shall do what I can.

106
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,270
Uncle, you mentioned

107
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,680
the anomaly in the West

108
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,510
and the collapse of the dam,

109
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,600
I've given
them consideration.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,390
You have
new understandings?

111
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,950
Not exactly
an understanding.

112
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,120
I remember

113
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,070
General Su

114
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,950
was garrisoned
at the Western frontier,

115
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,750
so I believe

116
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,670
he knows that region well.

117
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,210
So I'd like to order him
to investigate it.

118
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,680
General Su
is a decent person.

119
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
He's a good choice.

120
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,240
But there's no war going on,

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,600
if a well-respected

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,360
old general
was given a task,

123
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,950
would the decision
be criticized?

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,630
We are on the same page.

125
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,630
So I decide

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,830
to reinstate

127
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,600
General Su's daughter,

128
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,270
so giving
General Su a task

129
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,440
will look natural.

130
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
Ai yah.

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,880
My lady.

132
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,270
My lady.

133
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,720
I'm here with good news.

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,630
My lady.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
My lord.

136
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,950
Imperial order
for Noble Consort Su.

137
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,750
What is it?

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,870
Noble Consort Su

139
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,710
saved the emperor,

140
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,080
she's granted

141
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,190
reinstatement of nobility.

142
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,820
That's all.

143
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,590
Hey.

144
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,590
My lady.

145
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,430
Do you have a question?

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,270
Why don't you accept it?

147
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,320
Ai yah.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,120
My lady, rise, please.

149
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,600
I tell you what?

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,430
You are a lucky person.

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,950
You are reinstated

152
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,000
after being sent
to the cold palace.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,070
I think you...

154
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,950
- My lord.
- Yeah?

155
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,270
It's such a privilege.

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
No, no.

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
In the future,

158
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,390
I'll need more

159
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,510
of your support, right?

160
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,160
My lady, no problem.

161
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,830
You're General Su's daughter.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,000
If I had

163
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,070
- My lord.
- done something

164
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,630
- wrong...
- Thank you.

165
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,560
Ai yah.

166
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,750
My lady, you've
finally come around?

167
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
How did you achieve it?

168
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,680
I admire you so much.

169
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,270
The imperial palace

170
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,360
is like a tiger's den.

171
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,200
My lady, calm down.

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,120
I can hear you.

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,590
Whoa.

174
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,360
What do you want this time?

175
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,440
It's not
florescence festival yet.

176
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,840
I can't do it now.

177
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
I have no choice

178
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,840
but to be a puppet.

179
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,120
You have been reinstated.

180
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,480
Why didn't you listen to me?

181
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,960
You...

182
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Forget it.

183
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,910
I'll come fishing tomorrow.

184
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
What's with your look?

185
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,670
As if I'm bullying you.

186
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,080
No one has ever bullied me.

187
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,990
All right. All right.

188
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,910
Attempted assassination
on the emperor?

189
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,360
Good for you.

190
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
Are you always

191
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,790
this sarcastic?

192
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,230
Oh.

193
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,790
No, I wouldn't dare.

194
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
Hey.

195
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,440
