00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
No! No!

4
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
My lady, you had
another nightmare.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
Tao.

6
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,590
Quickly.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,150
I need a glass of water.

8
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,760
My lady, you had
another nightmare.

9
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,990
I'm okay.

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,350
I'm okay.

11
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,190
You have a red mark
on your neck.

12
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,960
If you tell people I'm here,

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
I'll tell them

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,590
I'm here

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
because we are
having an affair.

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
- A red mark?
- Yes.

17
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,630
The red mark...

18
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,190
Tao,

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,030
I'm so hungry.

20
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,750
I want to eat

21
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,080
stir-fried greens.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Stir-fried greens?

23
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,400
Go see if there's any

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,150
stir-fried greens

25
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,030
in the kitchen.

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,190
Go, go, go.

27
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,910
Stir-fried greens
at this hour?

28
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,560
Darn that man in black.

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
It's done.

30
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Whoa.

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
Looking good.

32
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,520
Very good.

33
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,190
My lady. My lady.

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Quickly,

35
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,910
see what I have
brought to you.

36
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,630
Tao,

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,560
you are a lantern killer.

38
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,870
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
How careless of me!

40
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,190
I will make ten

41
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,430
to make it up to you.

42
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,030
I worked so long on it.

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Wait,

44
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,560
what are these?

46
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,470

- There are more...

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,150
Is this a new trend
in the palace?

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,030
Whoever reads more

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,280
gets a prize?

52
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,430
No, my lady.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
You seem bored

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
every night,

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
so I got you something
to kill time.

56
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,000
Liar.

57
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,400
You think I'm seeing a man.

58
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,360
That I'm having an affair.

59
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,920
So you want to learn
female virtues.

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,200
Tao, you... You are...

61
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,190
No, no, no. I promise.

62
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,510
I'm only trying to say,

63
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,000
don't be reckless,

64
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,720
you have a higher goal.

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Otherwise,

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,480
a wrong step

67
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,920
may become the regret
of your life.

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,830
I think there's

69
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,480
a misunderstanding
between us.

70
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
If you agree
to listen to me,

71
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,560
I'll bring you

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,310
the pig feet soup

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,600
that I made yesterday.

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
OK.

75
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,120
Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
Go.

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,080
Sure.

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,750
Sister.

79
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,630
Sister Su.

80
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,160
Sister Li,

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
you came again.

82
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,870
Sounds like
I'm not welcomed.

83
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,480
Look around the harem,

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,680
only I still

85
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,310
talk to you.

86
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,670
Come.

87
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,830
Um...

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Have you...

89
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
Heard about that thing?

90
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,430
I have.

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,040
His Majesty promoted
a palace maid

92
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,160
to a concubine.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,750
I've got something juicier.

94
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,870
- Come here.
- Something juicier?

95
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,750
What's juicier?

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,590
What is it?

97
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,070
Prince of Ning An,

98
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
you know him?

99
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,920
The most handsome man
of Dacheng.

100
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,680
It's said he's unpredictable

101
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,270
and brutal.

102
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,190
He's in his late 20s,

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
but he isn't married yet.

104
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,950
Stop, stop, stop.

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
Everybody knows

106
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,720
what you just said.

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,950
Some days ago,

108
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,510
his marriage

109
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
with the second daughter

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
of the governor of Laicheng
was finally decided.

111
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,870
But yesterday,

112
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,680
he came to talk about

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,480
the reparation of the dam
with my dad,

114
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,630
and my maid told me

115
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,240
what the servants
chatted about.

116
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,950
The governor's daughter

117
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,680
wrote a letter

118
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
to publicize her years
of relationship

119
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
with a scholar next door.

120
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,950
And she defied
the arranged marriage

121
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,070
by running away with her love.

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,630
My gosh.

123
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,710
Wow.

124
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,670
Wow.

125
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,360
We cooperate.

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,070
You help me kill the emperor.

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,270
You said your wish

128
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,800
was to be
with your loved one.

129
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,750
I can break his engagement,

130
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,120
so you can marry him.

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,960
Tell me.

132
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,360
Who is he?

133
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,190
Who is he?

134
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,950
Who is he?

135
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,390
It's...

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Prince of Ning An.

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
Yes.

138
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,510
That's him.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,190
Prince of Ning An?

140
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,760
Fine.

141
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,070
Prince of Ning An
it is, then.

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Sister Li,

143
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,270
is this real?

144
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,350
Sure, it is real.

145
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
Oh, no.

146
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,830
Wait, how...

147
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,430
Why are you here?

148
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,000
How-how did you get in?

149
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,680
- I...
- You...

150
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,670
Wait, what?

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
Can't fall sleep?

152
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Huh?

153
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,120
What are you talking about?

154
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,350
Come on.

155
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
Where are they?

156
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Stop looking.

157
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,030
They won't come.

158
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,630
What do you mean?

159
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,150
What about them?

160
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,440
What did you do?

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,230
Dead.

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,200
Nonsense.
You drugged them.

163
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
You knocked them out.

164
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,600
They will wake up in an hour.

165
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,030
I was wondering
why I felt dizzy.

166
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,720
You did it.

167
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
Couldn't you give me a mask

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,360
before you lit the incense?

169
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,960
Why would I
leave you conscious?

170
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Do you wish

171
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,720
to be with me alone?

172
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,390
No, I don't.

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
Did you buy a cheap one?

174
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,480
Why am I still conscious?

175
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,910
You set the security

176
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,840
so tightly

177
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
against whom?

178
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
Against whom?

179
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
Against whom?

180
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,440
Against whom?

181
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Well, I...

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,870
I'm a vulnerable girl.

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
You...

184
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
You are a cold...

185
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
Cold-hearted assassin.

186
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,120
You broke into my chamber

187
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
with a sword against my neck.

188
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,320
Everybody

189
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
would be afraid.

190
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,840
I had no choice.

191
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,030
I don't have a sword tonight.

192
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,990
Oh.

193
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
Thank you, I guess?

194
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,600
Don't move.

195
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,240
