=Love in A Dream=

2
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,840
Concubine Chun has arrived.

4
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,920
You fell asleep here?

5
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,640
Sister.

6
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,870
You're here, too.

7
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,670
You can talk.

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,920
- Don't leave.
- I'm leaving.

9
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,790
I'm out of here.

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,790
Concubine Chun.

11
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,950
Kneel.

12
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,610
His Majesty has decided

13
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,350
to discontinue wasting time
in the harem

14
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
and re-focus on national affairs.

15
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,840
Concubine Chun,

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,240
with an indecisive mind,

17
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,190
is not an ideal consort.

18
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,430
You are stripped

19
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,520
of nobility

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,590
and evicted.

21
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,630
Miss Chun,

22
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,450
accept the order.

23
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
Your Majesty,

24
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,840
are you kicking me out?

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,960
It is what you wanted.

26
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,030
Go.

27
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,630
You're a liar.

28
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,870
You're a liar!

29
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,960
I shouldn't have

30
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,680
believed you.

31
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
You...

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,630
Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,800
Are you trying
to get yourself executed?

34
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,480
I apologize.

35
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,070
Your Majesty,

36
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,750
I wish you good health

37
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,070
and good fortune.

38
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,190
I hereby

39
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,950
bid you farewell.

40
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,360
Are you disobeying
an imperial order?

41
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,310
Su.

42
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Go.

43
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,400
Me?

44
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,040
OK, OK. I'm going.

45
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,230
Bye.

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Sister,

47
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,830
wait.

48
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,340
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,100
Your Majesty.

50
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,540
That was an act.

51
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,540
Don't feel bad.

52
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,860
De Quan,

53
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,100
did I really break her heart?

54
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,500
Your Majesty,

55
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,340
you must wait.

56
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,820
For the sake of your happiness.

57
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Oh, Your Majesty.

58
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,500
We should get you ready

59
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,100
to go out of the palace.

60
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,660
Yes.

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,380
So,

62
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,550
the empress dowager?

63
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,300
I'll talk to Her Grace.

64
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,100
OK.

65
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,780
Deliver the letter
to the prince.

66
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,900
The emperor is going out
of the palace.

67
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,140
Understood.

68
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,700
Have you found
anything suspicious?

69
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,100
Anything suspicious?

70
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,460
There is one person

71
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,900
that deserves
a thorough investigation.

72
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,940
Who?

73
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,300
Su Qin.
General Su's daughter.

74
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Tao.

75
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,840
When do you think
I can escape?

76
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,460
May lady.

77
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,420
My lady, I don't know.

78
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,300
- My lady.
- Tao?

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
- Tao?
- You'd get yourself killed.

80
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,420
Get up.

81
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
De Quan.

82
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
Wait here.

83
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,980
Aye.

84
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,620
Su.

85
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,460
Su.

86
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,860
Su?

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,750
Why are you here?

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
Huh?

89
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,060
Your Majesty.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,700
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

91
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,980
Please sit.

92
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,900
Please sit.

93
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,420
Abusing your maid

94
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,780
inside the chamber?

95
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,130
Huh?

96
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,740
Your Majesty,

97
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm nice to my servants.

98
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm the nicest.

99
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,650
Hmm.

100
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,380
They are all fond of me.

101
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,420
Your Majesty, sorry.

102
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,860
I'm okay.

103
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,140
I was just too tired.

104
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,140
Liar.

105
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,500
You were afraid my escape
would get me killed.

106
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,460
Well,

107
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,340
is that it?

108
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,100
Don't worry.

109
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,380
Now,

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,500
Lady Su and Chun

111
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
will have a bumpy journey
out there.

112
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,430
Take good care of them.

113
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,530
Going out with whom?

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,250
You and Chun.

115
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,990
Chun and I?

116
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,710
I'm going out as well?

117
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,450
Why would I go out?

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,660
I think

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,180
I have really
broken her heart.

120
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,100
- You will take good care
- Wait.

121
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,020
of her on the way.

122
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,380
- It has nothing...
- Also,

123
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,660
if those bandits

124
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,700
go too far,

125
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,580
you'll protect Chun for me.

126
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,680
How am I supposed to...

127
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,780
(Banknote One hundred)

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,540
Your Majesty,

129
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,780
please let me know

130
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,580
when I go out.

131
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,460
As for the food

132
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,420
and drink on the way,

133
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,470
buy the best.

134
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,140
Chun deserves the best.

135
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,180
Sure.

136
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,300
Chun's safety

137
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,780
and your happiness

138
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,020
are my responsibility.

139
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,460
Mmm.

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,530
Tomorrow noontime.

141
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,940
Don't be late.

142
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,740
Of course.

143
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Noontime it is.

144
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,420
I'll take the horse.

145
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,420
Your Majesty.

146
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,300
Um...

147
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,780
I may

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,660
need the horse

149
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,180
back.

150
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,180
Stingy.

151
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,900
Stingy.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,830
See you, Your Majesty.

153
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,980
All right.

154
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,020
I can't escape.

155
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,140
My lady,

156
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,340
what's troubling you?

157
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,900
I thought

158
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,420
I could escape

159
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,540
if this thing
got their attention.

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,620
Now,

161
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,380
I am to be with
Concubine Chun all the way.

162
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,660
Yes.

163
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,260
What if

164
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,140
you two noble ladies

165
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,060
run into danger?

166
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,020
- Us two?
- What do I do?

167
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,180
Only the two of us.

168
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,740
- I'll be...
- Tao,

169
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,460
spot on.

170
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
You won't follow me.

171
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,860
My lady,
you must take me with you.

172
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,540
You take the banknote

173
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,660
and buy yourself some good stuff.

174
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,980
My lady?

175
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,133
(Father, wait for me at the city gate
every day starting tomorrow)

176
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:07,100
(because I'll come home anytime.)

177
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,820
My lady,

178
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,260
- the letter...
- Tonight,

179
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
my father

180
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,820
must receive the letter.

181
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,940
OK.

182
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,420
But I can't take this, though.

183
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,500
Ah, yes. You'll bribe

184
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,620
the guards

185
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,620
using the banknote.

186
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,980
OK.

187
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,060
Ai yah.

188
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,340
Excellent. Very good.

189
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,820
Tao,

190
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
have you seen

191
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,100
any strangers lurking around

192
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,980
lately?

193
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,020
Strangers?

194
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,100
No, my lady.

195
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,420
Oh.

196
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,660
Tao,

197
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,900
go check
