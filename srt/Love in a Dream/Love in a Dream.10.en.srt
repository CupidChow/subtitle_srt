00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 10=

3
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,840
Has General Su arrived?

4
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,070
Your Highness,

5
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,750
he was notified.

6
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,520
General Su
will arrive after dinner.

7
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,000
General Su has arrived.

8
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,330
Greetings,

9
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,100
Your Highness.

10
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,500
No formalities, General Su.

11
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,900
Please sit.

12
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

13
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,380
(General Su
General-in-chief of Dacheng Kingdom)

14
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,380
You're a busy man,
Your Highness.

15
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,700
I wonder

16
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,700
what is our meeting about?

17
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,300
Some merchants
from the east visited me.

18
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
I was not sure

19
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,300
how to deal
with their gifts for me.

20
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,900
I've heard your daughter

21
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,100
has been reinstated.

22
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,940
I think it's a good thing

23
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,700
and she can have the gifts.

24
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,100
Your Highness,

25
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,980
is this how you
take it out on me?

26
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,900
The cancellation of marriage

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,020
wasn't my intention.

28
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,180
It's God's will.
It's an imperial order.

29
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,380
I must obey.

30
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,660
It's not what you think.

31
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,820
I'm not
a narrow-minded person.

32
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,780
We've been
in the system for years.

33
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,340
We do everything
for our kingdom

34
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,460
to achieve peace.

35
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,300
It's God's will.

36
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,580
We mortals must obey.

37
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,980
General Su, don't worry.

38
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,380
Some ill-intended ones in the dark,

39
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,380
however, wish to
undermine the kingdom.

40
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,180
What do you mean?

41
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,330
General Su,
you are a decent warrior

42
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,260
who sacrificed

43
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,860
everything for Dacheng.

44
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,700
If this is

45
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,420
what you mean,

46
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,580
well, I

47
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,660
must excuse myself.

48
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,500
Wait, General Su.

49
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,900
Read this letter.

50
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,700
Okay?

51
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,260
Dear Father,

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,380
this is your baby girl Su Qin.

53
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,920
My palm mark below
can verify my identity.

54
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,580
This time, I can get out of here.

55
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,980
But I don't know
which day yet.

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,540
wait for me at the city gate

57
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,300
every day starting tomorrow

58
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,580
because I'll come home anytime.

59
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,500
You!

60
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,500
General Su,

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,780
I don't know

62
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,820
why I'm quite fond of you.

63
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,660
If you're willing
to help me,

64
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,980
I can guarantee

65
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,660
your daughter's safety.

66
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,460
She'll be taken back to you

67
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,060
safe and sound.

68
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,420
I... You...

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,980
See you later, General Su.

70
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,460
Yay!

71
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,820
Yay!

72
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,500
Yay!

73
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,500
It's beautiful out there.

74
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,820
Sister Su,

75
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm curious about one thing.

76
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,460
What is it?

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,300
After all this time
we spent together,

78
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,260
I find that you are
an adorable, kind,

79
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,620
and genuine person.

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,220
But how come

81
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,740
you don't have many friends
in the harem

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,100
and you got confined?

83
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,380
Because

84
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,020
I have a disease.

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,620
What disease?

86
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,740
When I catch

87
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,980
someone lying,

88
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,860
I can't help but

89
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,820
point it out.

90
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,620
This is why

91
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,220
they keep away from me.

92
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,780
So you must know

93
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,220
what I'm thinking right now.

94
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,420
Sister,

95
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,580
I'm don't read minds.

96
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,500
I detect lies.

97
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,220
If you don't want
to get caught in a lie,

98
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,620
just don't lie to me.

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,370
Oh.

100
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,380
But if you don't want me
to know you're lying,

101
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,740
don't speak at all.

102
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,100
I see.

103
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,900
I'm so tired.

104
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,300
Sister.

105
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,900
Sister.

106
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,060
Ugh.

107
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,220
Again.

108
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,500
Sister.

109
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,020
What came again.

110
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,820
Sister,

111
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,100
I think

112
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,220
what happened to me

113
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,140
may have affected you, too,

114
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,660
so I'm here for you.

115
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,620
Thank you, Sister.

116
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,420
His Majesty and I

117
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,180
should never be together.

118
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,940
My brother

119
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,380
saved my life,

120
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,700
so I couldn't fail him.

121
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,620
But to do that,

122
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,340
I had to give up

123
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,740
the love of my own.

124
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,940
This path,

125
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,580
whether going right
or left,

126
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,420
doesn't seem the right way.

127
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,180
You have no other options?

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,660
Let's say,

129
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,820
get out
of this relationship

130
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,500
or go left before going right?

131
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,620
How I envy you, Sister.

132
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,020
You are always optimistic.

133
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,620
Having a sister like you

134
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,860
is a fortune of my life.

135
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,300
Look at you.

136
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,820
With me,

137
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,500
you can't eat or sleep well.

138
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,340
It's true
that I often feel hungry.

139
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,740
Sister,

140
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,180
please accept my apology.

141
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,420
Room 207.

142
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,780
Your food is here.

143
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,700
Pork joint.

144
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,660
Liver.

145
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,580
Chicken wings.

146
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,740
Bamboo shoots.

147
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,660
Ai yah.

148
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,300
Couldn't you come later?

149
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,260
Why must you
serve the dishes now?

150
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,460
Sister, you enjoy.

151
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,060
I'm going back to my room.

152
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,180
How about you join me?

153
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,740
I'm not hungry.

154
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,340
Sister.

155
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Come on.

156
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,340
Why must you

157
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,620
come in now?

158
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,340
Go, go, go.

159
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,180
Mm.

160
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,660
