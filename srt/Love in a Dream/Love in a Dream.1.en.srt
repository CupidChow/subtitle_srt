1
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,680
Hold still.

2
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,040
Or I'll kill you.

3
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
No, please.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
Have mercy.

5
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,310
Who sent you?

6
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,920
No matter how much
they pay you,

7
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,690
I-I'll double it.

8
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,120
A thousand gold.

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Nonsense. It's your mother's
death anniversary.

10
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,680
You are drunk and in
a confused state of mind.

11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,230
You wanted to
kill someone on a whim.

12
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,330
You don't charge a penny.

13
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,120
You know who I am?

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,100
I don't know you.

16
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,890
Please don't kill me.

17
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,280
Whatever you want,

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,500
I can help you.

19
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,840
Let's cooperate.

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,810
We can cooperate, can't we?

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,760
You'd better be careful.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,500
I hate liars.

23
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,380
=Love in A Dream=

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
=Episode 1=

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,100
(A few hours ago)

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,380
(Lu Huan
Prince of Ning An)

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,530
Your Highness, I apologize.

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,010
It's my fault.

29
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,740
(Gu
An Imperial Squire)

30
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,500
I was away from
the capital city for a year.

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,340
You've done well.

32
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,810
Your Highness, no worries.

33
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,180
There's no major event
in the palace.

34
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,410
It's just...

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,710
General Su sent the
rejection letter days ago.

36
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,220
His daughter
is now a noble consort.

37
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,570
The rejection letter
of marriage?

38
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes.

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
An order arrived!

40
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,940
Prince of Ning An is to attend
a banquet 3 days later.

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,010
You've just returned
for several days.

42
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,940
The banquet you're
ordered to attend,

43
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,780
I guess there's
something behind it.

44
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,180
Doesn't matter.

45
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,570
By the way,

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,380
for the death anniversary,

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,850
preparations have been
made same as last year.

48
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,570
No interference this time.

49
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,190
Servants.

50
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,360
Remove all of those.

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
(De Quan, Chief Attendant)
Noble Consort Su, an order's arrived.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,220
Coming.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,340
My lord,

54
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,430
what is it?

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,940
(Su Qin, Noble Consort)
Well, well.

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Noble Consort Su,

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,390
it must have been not

58
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,260
easy for you
to live this long.

59
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
My lord,

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,780
you know,

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,900
- I...
- Noble Consort Su.

62
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,780
- Ill-mannered...
- Bad news! Bad news!

63
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,310
- Silence!
- Bad news! Bad news!

64
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,390
- Noble Consort...
- Bad news!

65
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,370
What is it?

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,100
What?

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,630
Say that again!

68
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,400
- Noble Consort Zhang was abolished.
- I...

69
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,580
The empress dowager is angry.

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,780
Move!

71
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,310
My lord, my lord.

72
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,230
What is it?

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,510
Look for yourself.

74
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,870
- Quickly, move!
- My lord.

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,870
Move.

76
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,970
Hurry.

77
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,600
Hey,

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,720
do you know what happened?

79
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,100
What is it?

80
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,260
They all left.

81
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,100
My lady.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,700
My lady.

83
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,510
(Tao, Maidservant)
You keep making trouble.

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,510
What do we do?

85
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,800
Your father will be mad
if he knows.

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm worried about
our future life.

87
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,490
Tao,

88
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,160
go out there
and ask around

89
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,100
what happened
in the imperial palace.

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,580
(Lu Heng, Emperor of Dacheng Kingdom)
A pair for a life.

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,490
Two souls grow old.

92
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,820
Watch out, Your Majesty!

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
As a ruler,

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,630
he's lost in romance.

95
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,580
Does he not feel guilty?

96
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,750
The rain is heavy.

97
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,530
I wonder
when Tao will return.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,700
Hold still.

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,260
Or I'll kill you.

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,680
Sir.

101
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,830
Sir, please.
Have mercy.

102
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,020
Who sent you?

103
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,580
Noble Consort Zhang?

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,920
Beauty Liu?

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,930
Beauty Wen?

106
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,100
I-I'll double it.

107
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,510
A thousand gold.

108
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,160
Nonsense. It's your mother's
death anniversary.

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,070
You are drunk and in
a confused state of mind.

110
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,630
You wanted to
kill someone on a whim.

111
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,900
You don't charge a penny.

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
You know who I am?

113
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
I don't.

114
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,170
I don't know you, sir.

115
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,440
Sir,

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,730
that was a joke.

117
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,700
Please don't kill me.

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,070
Whatever you want,

119
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,290
I can help you.

120
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,630
Let's cooperate.

121
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,970
We can cooperate, can't we?

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,780
You'd better be careful.

123
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,720
I hate liars.

124
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,630
I...

125
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,600
I-I, too, hate...

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,950
Hate liars.

127
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,820
Sir,

128
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,070
not only do I hate liars,

129
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,370
but I can also
identify a lie.

130
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,170
How about you tell a lie

131
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,370
and I'll identify it?

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,360
I took action
at noon yesterday.

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,200
Midnight.

134
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,290
I drank osmanthus wine
last night.

135
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,240
Rice wine.

136
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,410
I ate almond crisp.

137
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,590
Green bean cake.

138
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Whoa.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,970
My jade pendant.

140
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,870
Sir, uh...

141
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,240
Can I have

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,170
my pendant back?

143
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,230
Hey!

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,970
- I...
- One who identifies lies

145
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,850
also tell lies.

146
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Sir,

147
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,610
you still don't believe me?

148
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
I swear

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,170
that we're on the same side.

150
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,490
Touch me
if you don't believe me.

151
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,360
My lady,

152
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
sorry to disturb you.

153
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,480
But there was an attempted
assassination on His Majesty.

154
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,070
- Are you all right?
- His...

155
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,020
His Majesty?

156
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,680
Sir.

157
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,430
Please, please, please.

158
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,390
Sir, I'm sorry.

159
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,820
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

160
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,490
If you tell people I'm here,

161
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,610
I'll tell them

162
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,540
I'm here

163
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,250
because we are
having an affair.
