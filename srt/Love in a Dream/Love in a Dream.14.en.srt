=Love in A Dream=

2
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,260
I wonder how Chun is doing.

4
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,180
They have arrived
in Yun Town.

5
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,780
Don't worry.

6
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,940
You're up to date.

7
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,060
I must schedule
my outing soon.

8
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,060
What is it?

9
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,100
You may get hungry.

10
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,420
Snacks for you on the way.

11
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,860
- I'm not hungry.
- Your Highness.

12
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,740
I-I'm hungry.

13
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
The snacks for you
from your prince.

14
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260
I'm not hungry anymore.

15
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,340
It's fine.

16
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,180
You may have them.

17
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,860
You are not hungry.

18
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,700
I... I...

19
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,620
He said he was hungry.

20
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,340
You are not hungry.

21
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,260
He said he was.

22
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,060
Are you hungry?

23
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,940
I'm hungry.

24
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,180
I'll have them.

25
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,940
Sister Chun.

26
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
What's the matter
with you?

27
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,180
Before I lived in the palace,

28
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,300
I never had any snacks.

29
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,140
The emperor
one time personally

30
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,900
made osmanthus cakes for me.

31
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,740
But it was too sweet

32
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
and I didn't want
to get fat.

33
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,620
So he made all kinds of desserts

34
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,460
for me after that.

35
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,340
You miss him.

36
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,180
Yeah, kind of.

37
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,580
Don't worry.

38
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,820
The loved ones

39
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,820
shall reunite.

40
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
I'm not worried.

41
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,700
As long as he's fine,

42
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,660
it makes me happy.

43
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,220
I guess this is love.

44
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,100
Is it?

45
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
When you see
each other every day,

46
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,180
you're used to his existence,

47
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,420
so you aren't aware

48
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,340
how important
he is to you.

49
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,780
It isn't until you're separated

50
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,140
do you feel

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,380
his weight in your heart.

52
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,940
And if he's happy,

53
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,140
you're happy.

54
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,500
I now understand.

55
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,540
how did you know

56
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,580
we'd take the shortcut
to Guazhou

57
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,420
through Lvcheng Mountain

58
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,780
instead of the forest,
which is safer?

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,300
You know
the emperor's plan?

60
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,220
I do.

61
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,660
I also know

62
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,140
the emperor will
give back your freedom.

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,020
So if you're here,

64
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,140
how does he
execute his plan?

65
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,500
You're a good warrior.

66
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,540
And his men know you.

67
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,220
How do they get back?

68
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,540
How about

69
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,940
we split up?

70
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,040
We go back to Si City

71
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,230
Gu will stay with Chun.

72
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,980
Mr. Gu stays

73
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,260
with Sister Chun?

74
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,500
That's feasible.

75
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,340
It's a safer way.

76
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,420
And then...

77
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,740
Then what?

78
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,700
After the show is over,

79
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,740
is there anything
you'd like to do?

80
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,140
I'll stick with you.

81
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,420
I promised
to fulfill your wish.

82
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,700
Lady Su,

83
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,740
please say good things
about me.

84
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,760
We'll see.

85
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,500
Sister,

86
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,100
His Highness and I
had a discussion.

87
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,220
We'd better split up.

88
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,900
It's safer that way.

89
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,940
It happens

90
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,780
His Majesty has
some personal business.

91
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,500
So

92
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,220
we'll bid
each other farewell.

93
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,380
What?

94
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,420
Why must

95
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,260
we leave?

96
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,820
Do I have to report

97
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,820
everything to you?

98
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,380
Sister, so we set off now.

99
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,140
We'll meet
at the destination.

100
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,980
Okay.

101
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,740
Let's go.

102
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,980
Mm.

103
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,220
Mother,

104
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,300
why are you here?

105
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,940
Banishment to the frontier
wasn't enough?

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,230
You even killed them?

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,900
What are you talking about?

108
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,460
It confuses me.

109
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,340
I didn't

110
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,020
execute anyone

111
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,140
but some enemy spies.

112
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
Is this what you're
talking about?

113
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,140
Watch your tone!

114
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Here's my warning to you.

115
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,220
Politics

116
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,700
is a matter
of grave importance,

117
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,740
you mustn't

118
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,460
make random decisions.

119
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,380
Mother,

120
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,420
are you aware

121
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,860
that the enemy's invasion

122
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
is causing disturbance

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,810
and the number
of refugees is increasing?

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,210
Since I'm in power,

125
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,100
I must put
national security first.

126
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
Good.

127
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,620
Very good.

128
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,220
If your father could

129
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,180
see how well you are doing,

130
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,340
I think

131
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,300
he would be gratified.

132
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,820
I'll go out on a trip soon.

133
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,740
But I'll make sure

134
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,500
you aren't troubled
by internal affairs.

135
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,260
Your Majesty.

136
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,940
Say no more.

137
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,220
Prepare for my outing.

138
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,900
Aye.

139
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,860
Today's sunset is beautiful.

140
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,340
The weather is nice as well.

141
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,090
- Your Highness.
- Rouge.

142
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,700
Premium rouge.

143
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,140
Why do you keep
looking at me that way?

144
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,230
What way?

145
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,100
Oh.

146
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,780
Nothing.

147
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,820
There's a tea stand.

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
Let's take a break.

149
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,780
Enjoy the view.

150
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,020
Tea's here.

151
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,060
Thanks.

152
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,100
Your Highness,

153
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,420
are you having
a heat stroke?

154
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,220
You look flushed

155
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,180
and unnatural.

156
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,420
Oh.

157
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
It is kind of hot.

158
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,300
Pretty hot.

159
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,220
Are you

160
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,060
worried about me?

161
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,460
Well, no.

162
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,020
- Careful.
- It's good.

163
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,100
Ai yah,

164
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,060
take it slowly.

165
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,980
You don't want
to choke on it.

166
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,060
I like this.

167
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,180
It's only sold once a year.

168
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,420
If it was sold every day,

169
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,060
the Lovers' Cake would
be meaningless.

170
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
It's so good.

171
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,860
Although I do want
to see you every day.

172
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,460
Waiter.

173
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,420
A plate of Lovers' Cakes

174
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,540
