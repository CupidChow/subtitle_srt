00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,710
- Sir.
- Hi.

4
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,310
- A bowl of wontons.
- Sure.

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Sit here, please.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,120
Wait a moment.

7
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
OK.

8
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,840
We traveled all the way
from Guazhou.

9
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,870
We deserve a good meal.

10
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
No worries.

11
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,380
The prince

12
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
wants to capture

13
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,180
the emperor's concubine.

14
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,020
I've got the message

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,060
that she just got out
of the palace.

16
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
And now

17
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,620
she's in Yun Town.

18
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,820
I've heard

19
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,380
Prince of Ning An is near.

20
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,740
That jerk

21
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,140
fought us all the time.

22
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,320
Humph.

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,060
I've prepared
the knock-out drug.

24
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,580
I'll make sure he's killed.

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,540
Yeah.

26
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,740
This time,

27
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,460
he's dead for sure.

28
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,540
Yeah, he's
a dead man walking.

29
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,780
Humph.

30
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,220
Catch her.

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,180
Uncle.

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,780
You're spruced up, Uncle.

33
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,260
You arrive early,
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,940
As of now,

35
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,660
we are both sticking
to the plan.

36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,020
It's for the future of Dacheng.

37
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,740
We must be synchronized.

38
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,620
You still
make excellent speeches

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,220
like you did
when we were little.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,180
You're better than me

41
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,380
at knowledge and martial arts.

42
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,660
Mother raised me,

43
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,740
so I had no power.

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,740
I had to put on a mask.

45
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,740
But you returned,

46
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,380
I have seen that

47
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,540
you do everything
for the good of Dacheng,

48
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,460
so I declared my stance.

49
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,420
Over the years,

50
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,060
you didn't have trust in me,

51
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,580
and I get it.

52
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,740
But as I'm looking at you,

53
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,060
I don't see any difference.

54
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,380
Uncle,

55
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,340
on my way here,

56
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,780
I saw the grim reality.

57
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,940
The enemy's invasion

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,420
and the natural disaster

59
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,240
are making
people homeless.

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,940
Uncle, we must do something.

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,180
Someone is sending

62
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,620
information to the enemy
from inside the palace.

63
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,140
They're likely to have
control of everything.

64
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,380
After all these years,

65
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,900
I've finally known
more of you.

66
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,300
With you at my side,

67
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,740
I feel secure.

68
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,460
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

69
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,380
Lady Su has been taken
by bad people from Guazhou.

70
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,940
Where are we?

71
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,300
Doesn't matter.

72
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,220
I don't think

73
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,620
it's a good place.

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,660
Yo, you're awake,
my prince.

75
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,660
Have mercy, my lord!

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,820
Have mercy!

77
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,460
- My lord, please!
- So annoying.

78
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,460
Kill her.

79
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,940
Have mercy, my lord!

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,220
Please don't!

81
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,540
My prince,

82
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,820
you'll be the emperor

83
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,940
who rules a country.

84
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,340
You need to learn
anger management.

85
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,220
What do you know?

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,860
Bah!

87
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,220
De Quan didn't
send money over this month?

88
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,940
Oh.

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,380
I'll see to it.

90
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,580
You are

91
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,340
from Dacheng Kingdom.

92
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,220
You, too?

93
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,320
So weak.

94
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,900
Bah!

95
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,780
Remove her blindfold.

96
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,180
Get her over here.

97
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,860
Teach me how to
write your characters.

98
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,020
Quickly.

99
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,540
Kill the man!

100
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,740
- Move.
- My lord!

101
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,940
My lord!

102
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,860
My lord, I can write, too!

103
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,700
I do carving!

104
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,460
I can do carving,

105
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,380
my lord!

106
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,940
Wooden figurines!

107
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,140
I carve wooden figurines!

108
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,980
Wait!

109
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
My lord.

110
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,300
Hmm?

111
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,100
Do you like it?

112
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,700
Pretty good.

113
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,820
Who taught you?

114
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,100
I taught myself.

115
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,940
Oh.

116
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,660
You're gifted.

117
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,500
Yeah.

118
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,940
Good.

119
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,980
This is good.

120
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,700
I like it.

121
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,180
I didn't ask you to write.

122
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,700
You teach me to write.

123
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,460
Quickly!

124
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,460
How do I write?

125
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,340
Release me!

126
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,620
Hmm?

127
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,580
Sister?

128
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,580
