=Love in A Dream=

2
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,710
Don't be afraid.

4
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,990
- I'm here.
- Rouge.

5
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,840
Premium rouge.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Just take a look.

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,760
Regardless of my identity,

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,020
my feelings for you
are genuine.

9
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,180
It's definitely not a lie.

10
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,580
It was unexpected

11
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,860
when we first met.

12
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,580
And then,

13
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,060
for some reason,

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,540
one lie after another,

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,740
so I could only keep acting.

16
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,380
If Gu hadn't

17
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,300
called you prince,

18
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,700
how much longer
would you keep lying?

19
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,260
If you're still mad,

20
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,940
I can continue
to be the Man in Black.

21
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
Is that okay?

22
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,340
Rouge.

23
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,950
Is this what you always do?

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
No.

25
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,260
I don't know

26
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,100
how to explain
what I'm doing.

27
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,060
Right.

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,820
You're a prince

29
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,940
while I'm nobody.

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,660
I don't deserve explanation.

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,500
No.

32
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,140
I want to be with you,

33
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,460
so I...

34
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,500
Please stop.

35
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,460
We're from two
different worlds.

36
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,580
Come home with me.

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,820
And you can be mad at me
however you like.

38
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,940
I don't want you
to stroll alone on the street.

39
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,060
Huh?

40
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,700
Hey!

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,500
- You...
- Deliver it to my mansion.

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,940
Go away!

43
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,460
Out of my way!

44
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,380
Hey,

45
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
I never saw him
act like that.

46
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,780
Such scene

47
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,500
never occurred
in this mansion.

48
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,820
Right.

49
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,780
Get back to work.

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,380
You're tired.

51
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,850
I've ordered the kitchen
to prepare some food.

52
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,140
Some letters

53
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,820
from the imperial palace
have arrived.

54
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
I need to deal with them.

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,540
Make yourself at home.

56
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,620
OK.

57
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,220
- I...
- Keep kneeing.

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,420
Don't follow me.

59
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,180
Mr. Gu,

60
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,820
what's this for?

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,620
Lady Su,

62
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,380
please help me.

63
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
I'm loyal to His Majesty.

64
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,820
I've served under him
for 15 years.

65
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,140
It was good between us
before you appeared.

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,460
But...

67
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,220
Ever since you entered his life,

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,140
he has never been
satisfied with us.

69
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,140
I failed to keep you safe,

70
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,060
His Majesty was furious
with me and Miss Yuelian.

71
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,460
Please say something
good about us.

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,340
Talk more about

73
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,780
Miss Yuelian's and my

74
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,060
bonds with him.

75
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,420
Our happiness

76
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,940
for the rest of our lives

77
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,500
is counting on you.

78
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,500
You...

79
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,180
You and the prince,

80
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,980
and Yuelian...

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,060
Are the three of you...

82
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,540
Yes.

83
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
Yes.

84
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,020
We all are.

85
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,540
For-for real?

86
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
For real.

87
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,220
Your Grace.

88
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,940
The emperor is in the study.

89
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,020
Please calm down.

90
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,860
Or it's bad for your health.

91
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,660
But

92
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,340
the emperor

93
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,300
does feel different to me.

94
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,580
It's like

95
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,700
someone powerful
got his back,

96
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,820
or he wouldn't
dare offend you.

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,140
He's an adult.

98
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,760
I knew he got some moves,

99
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,660
but I didn't expect

100
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,820
he'd build connections
with officials

101
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,020
under my watch

102
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,740
and caught me off guard.

103
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,140
I underestimated him.

104
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm not sure

105
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,820
who is giving

106
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,820
him support.

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,820
Could it be

108
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,260
General Su?

109
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,700
General Su?

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,820
I think

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,580
it's Prince of Ning An.

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Regardless,

113
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,220
Prince of Ning An or not,

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,100
he must be

115
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,340
taken seriously.

116
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,700
The way I see it,

117
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,300
he's potential trouble.

118
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,060
My lord.

119
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,580
I acknowledge

120
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,860
my mistake.

121
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,420
What mistake?

122
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,100
My mistake is,

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,020
I failed to watch

124
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,540
the emperor closely.

125
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,300
Never mind.

126
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,060
Your mission ends here.

127
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,660
I don't need you
to spy on him anymore.

128
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,160
My lord,

129
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,140
are-are you saying...

130
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,980
My meaning is,

131
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,300
your mission is over.

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,860
You're no longer my spy.

133
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,300
You can do anything

134
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,340
you want.

135
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,460
But...

136
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,100
I...

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,340
Including you being
with the emperor.

138
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,980
Really?

139
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,020
I can still be with him?

140
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,700
Go.

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,740
He chose you
over the entire harem.

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,580
You must love him back.

143
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,300
Be his beloved concubine.

144
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,790
Thank you, my lord.

145
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,700
I need you to do

146
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,820
another thing for me.

147
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,620
What is it, my lord?

148
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,020
Just give your order.

149
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,540
It's about Su Qin.

150
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,500
I've heard
you two get along well.

151
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,100
I understand.

152
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,250
I'll complete the mission.

153
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,220
I give you my word.

154
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,330
I'll cheer her up.

155
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,460
Don't go over the top, though.

156
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,940
Aye.

157
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,500
Ugh.

158
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,460
Sister,

159
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,380
we're out of wine.

160
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,420
Whose fault is it?

161
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Is it my fault?

162
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,030
Certainly not yours.

163
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,460
It's not theirs, either.

164
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,420
Their relationships
are unspeakable.

165
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,180
Their love

166
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,980
must be under pressure.

167
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,940
Who are they?

168
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,060
Or maybe

169
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,340
it's not them two,

170
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,540
but them three.

171
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,740
Them three?

172
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,500
Did I

173
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,380
make a mistake?

174
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,660
Did I get the prince wrong?

175
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,020
Is Yuelian

176
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,540
the one he loves?

177
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,860
So he asked me to talk you

178
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,320
into giving up?

179
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,260
Love whom?

180
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,910
Give up what?

181
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,300
Nothing.

182
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,580
I knew it.

183
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,340
I knew I was late.

184
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,260
No, Sister.

185
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,020
Sister, here's the thing.

186
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,260
I feel you.

187
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,100
The prince is a fine man,

188
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,540
he's a perfect choice.

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,020
But it is what it is.

190
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,100
It's a great shame.

191
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,460
However, your love for him

192
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,060
is still in the bud,

193
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,140
you can nip the bud.

194
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,740
Yes, nip it.

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,580
Sister,

196
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,300
we'll set out
tomorrow morning.

197
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,820
We'll get out
of this place.

198
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,660
Yeah, sure.

199
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,180
We'll set out
tomorrow morning.

200
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,540
Your Highness,

201
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,660
General Su's letter says

202
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,660
His Majesty will arrive
in 3 to 5 days.

203
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,900
What about him

204
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,110
after we leave?

205
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,060
We send them out of Guazhou

206
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,660
and come back at once.

207
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,300
Our people are ready.

208
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,940
Aye.

209
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,940
Yuelian is in control here.

210
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,380
There should be no problem.

211
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,020
We will be quick.

212
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,860
Mm.

213
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,060
Why isn't the driver
here already?

214
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,660
Just wait.

215
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,060
He might be delayed.

216
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,060
Don't see us off.

217
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,380
Go.

218
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,140
His Highness is concerned.

219
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,540
He changed the plan.

220
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,140
We set out together.

221
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,060
