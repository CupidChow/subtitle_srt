=Episode 8=

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,150
Now, now.

4
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,310
Don't be afraid.

5
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,550
I'm here.

6
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,950
Don't worry.

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Be patient.

8
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,040
I've got you a new job.

9
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,280
You'll soon have a new life.

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Don't be scared.

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
You've got me.

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,510
Don't worry.

13
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,310
But

14
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,470
how come you always
see me at night?

15
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,840
I wish I could see you
in the daytime,

16
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,430
but in the daytime,

17
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,000
you are with the emperor.

18
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,940
Stop.

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,280
Just so you know,

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,750
I don't want to be with him.

21
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,000
He makes me

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,680
keep his baby girl company.

23
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,870
I don't eat well,

24
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,840
sleep well

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,700
or sit comfortably.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
You know?

27
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,120
I have to be there

28
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,590
like an idiot,

29
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,470
and I am to laugh with them.

30
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,870
I thought

31
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,590
he was fond of you.

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,040
He doesn't have good taste.

33
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,710
I agree.

34
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,550
Tomorrow.

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,960
I take you to see
Prince of Ning An.

36
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,590
To...

37
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,590
Tomorrow?

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,190
Tomorrow...

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,910
Too soon.

40
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,520
No. I just...

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,030
But...

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Hey, you.

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,750
Wait, your...

44
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,120
Your coat.

45
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,030
Your coat.

46
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,870
What?

47
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,280
What is the matter with him?

48
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,400
He's so random.

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,970
All right.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
Be careful, Your Majesty.

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
De Quan.

52
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,120
Open your mouth.

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Your Majesty.

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Be careful.

55
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,910
Fill the wine cup.

56
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,750
OK.

57
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,560
Please don't drink too much.

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,630
I'm okay.

59
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,630
Greetings, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,400
What is it, Uncle?

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,000
I've heard you're troubled

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
by Concubine Chun.

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,430
I have a plan

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,800
for you

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,920
to win her love.

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,130
Do tell, Uncle.

67
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,310
It hasn't been busy lately.

68
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,650
You may go on a trip
with Lady Chun

69
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,500
and arrange an accident
where you play the hero.

70
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,460
As far as I know,

71
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,900
in most folk novels,

72
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,700
this is how men and women
fall in love.

73
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
Ah.

74
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,820
Yes, yes.

75
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,580
That's smart.

76
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,780
We may go to Guazhou.

77
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,220
Uh.

78
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,300
No.

79
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,620
What I mean is,

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,700
in this time of the year.

81
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,940
Guazhou is perfect
for a trip.

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,340
The weather is pleasant.

83
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,850
The flowers are fragrant.

84
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,560
A very nice place.

85
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,030
Mmm.

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,620
Good plan, Uncle.

87
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,840
Good recommendation,
De Quan.

88
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,420
So we will

89
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,930
start making preparations.

90
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,620
You may summon me anytime,
Your Majesty.

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,940
I'll be off.

92
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,660
De Quan,

93
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,460
do bring along
Chun's friend,

94
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
Noble Consort Su.

95
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,220
Noble Consort Su?

96
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,760
Yes.
So she can have company.

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,700
Aye.

98
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,560
More wine.

99
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,740
Your Majesty,
be careful with alcohol.

100
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,610
Have you made
the arrangement

101
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,820
about the matters outside the city?

102
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,660
Your Majesty,

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,700
it's all set.

104
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,180
Is another conversation

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,090
with General Su needed?

106
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,650
For the time being, no.

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,440
What is Prince of Ning An

108
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,570
up to lately?

109
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
Nothing special.

110
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,020
But I'm told
he's in a good mood.

111
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,100
Is that so?

112
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,890
Before we leave the palace,

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
do another research

114
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,080
on this uncle of mine.

115
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,900
For all these years,

116
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,950
he has always
been a mystery.

117
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,220
Noble Consort Su
may be useful.

118
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,580
Summon her.

119
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
Aye.

120
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,300
The emperor wants to bring
Noble Consort Su along.

121
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,820
It's none of our business.

122
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,700
We may have to bring
our operation forward.

123
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,660
OK.

124
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,430
Ahhh!

125
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,920
What?

126
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,840
You're going to kick
Lady Chun out?

127
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,500
Is that true?

128
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,180
I knew it.

129
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,100
All emperors are bad.

130
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,040
Watch it!

131
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,620
How dare you
disobey me?

132
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
No.

133
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,340
I wouldn't dare.

134
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Lady Su,

135
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,260
let me finish.

136
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,780
OK. All right.

137
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,960
Please explain.

138
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,050
The operation

139
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,620
is meant to

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,170
complete me and Chun.

141
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,060
I

142
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,990
will drive her out

143
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,820
so she will think

144
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,300
that I abandon her.

145
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,500
And then,

146
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
on her way,

147
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,020
someone disguised as bandits

148
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,940
will catch her.

149
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,780
Your Majesty,

150
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,180
I have a question.

151
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,300
Aren't you worried at all?

152
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,380
What if

153
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,340
by accident

154
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,660
Lady Chun

155
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,460
gets killed?

156
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,180
You fool.

157
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,820
I said,

158
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,380
"disguised as bandits".

159
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,220
I will only send

160
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,420
the men that I trust.

161
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
They wouldn't dare.

162
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,550
Then what?

163
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,060
Then.

164
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,260
In the end,

165
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,620
I go there alone

166
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,300
in white

167
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,760
single-handed

168
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,820
to rescue my love.

169
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,470
After that,

170
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,620
Chun and I live

171
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,220
a happy life together.

172
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,500
What about it?

173
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,740
It's a perfect plan, isn't it?

174
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,100
Yes, yes, yes.

175
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,260
Just perfect.

176
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,300
Your Majesty,

177
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,280
this silly...

178
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,380
Um,

179
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,180
perfect plan.

180
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,890
Who came up with it?

181
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,520
My uncle.

182
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,890
Prince of Ning An.

183
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,460
My goodness.

184
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,340
I think Prince of Ning An
hates him.

185
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,180
Hmm?

186
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,140
Perfect plan!

187
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,340
Your Majesty,

188
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,180
we'll take action immediately.

189
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,620
All right.

190
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,860
I shall summon
Concubine Chun.

191
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,900
Servant.

192
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,700
Summon Concubine Chun.

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,420
Lady Su.

194
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,300
You wait here.

195
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,260
Got it.

196
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,430
♪Rolling mountains
and vast lake♪

197
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,230
