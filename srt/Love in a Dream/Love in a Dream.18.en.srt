3
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,430
Does it hurt?

4
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,510
It looks very serious.

5
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm okay.

6
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Only a small injury.

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is this a small injury?

8
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,030
I almost see your bone!

9
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
You got injured
when you protected me.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
But I remember

11
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,630
you blocked it
with your sword.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,910
I got caught off guard.

13
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
Liar.

14
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,910
You can't rinse

15
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,280
the wound

16
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,800
until three days later.

17
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,430
Do you hear me?

18
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,590
Be careful with it.

19
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,750
Su Qin.

20
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,080
Mm?

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
Nothing.

22
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,190
Just wanted
to call your name.

23
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Chun,

24
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,280
are you injured?

25
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,310
Please don't call me Chun.

26
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
Please call me

27
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,130
Zhao Wanchun.

28
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Chun, I...

29
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Ah.

30
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,120
We got out of trouble

31
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,870
thanks to Captain Gu.

32
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,950
Many thanks to Captain Gu.

33
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,910
Your Majesty,

34
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,800
I'll contact General Su

35
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,080
to come to get us.

36
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,680
Chun,

37
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,950
take good care
of His Majesty.

38
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,430
I didn't know

39
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,390
you were such
a good fighter.

40
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,240
I studied martial arts
when I was little,

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,920
so I know some moves
just to protect myself.

42
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,720
I studied martial arts, too.

43
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,160
Uncle forced me

44
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
to practice every day.

45
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,600
You're so good.

46
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,070
I'm sure
your training was tough.

47
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,670
Chun,

48
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
I pushed you out
of the palace

49
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,850
was a way to
survey the situations.

50
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,000
But I never wanted

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,310
you to be in danger.

52
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,430
It was inconsiderate of me.
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,240
But trust me,

54
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,160
when all the problems
are dealt with,

55
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,950
I'll love you
with all my heart.

56
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,470
Chun!

57
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,630
The truth is,

58
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
I have been lying to you.

59
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,710
I know.

60
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,640
Chun,

61
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,870
I will marry you formally,

62
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,390
no longer as a concubine.

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,920
I give you my promise.

I... I'm okay.

88
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,540
You're having a fever.

89
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
Lu Huan,

90
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,380
get up.

91
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,940
- I'll be fine after a while.
- Quickly.

92
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,780
I'll get you some water.

93
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,860
It isn't okay.

94
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,020
Get up.

95
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,340
Sit up.

96
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,300
Stay here.

97
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,620
Don't go.

98
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,940
Don't go.

99
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,540
- Don't leave me.
- OK.

100
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,540
OK.

101
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,020
Don't leave me.

102
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm here.

103
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,300
I'm here.

104
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
Don't leave me.

105
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,260
I won't leave you.

106
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,780
I won't leave you.

107
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,660
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't leave me.

108
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,140
Don't leave me.

109
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,580
Don't leave me.

110
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,460
- Don't leave me.
- Don't worry.

111
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Don't worry, Lu Huan.

112
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,180
- I'm here.
- Don't leave me.

113
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,420

114
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,140

115
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,540
Don't be afraid.

116
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm here.

117
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,700
I'm here.

118
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,260
Mengmeng.

119
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,220
Aye.

120
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,260
The empress dowager

121
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,140
no longer has power.

122
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,260
Prince of Ning An
has disappeared.

123
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,180
The emperor

124
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,060
is hardly a threat.

125
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,580
- Ah.
- When the time is right,

126
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,260
we launch
the final operation.

127
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,380
But

128
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,380
that girl

129
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,700
is trouble.

130
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,860
You mean
Noble Consort Su Qin?

131
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Yes, her.

132
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,500
I tell you what,

133
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,820
she's sophisticated.

134
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,860
And

135
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,420
General Su is behind her.

136
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,980
She must be removed.

137
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,660
Mm.

138
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,060
Answer me,

139
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,220
is the prince ready?

140
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,500
Uh...

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,860
Uh what? Speak!

142
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
The prince is injured,

143
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
but he's okay.

144
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,860
He's still after the emperor

145
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,700
and his gang.

146
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,260
Keep me updated.

147
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,740
With the prince,

148
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,980
there can be no mistakes.

149
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
- Aye.
- Go.

150
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,700
Fool.

151
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,820

152
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,060
