=Episode 17=

3
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,120
I waited for days.

4
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,000
Finally,

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,310
I have you,

6
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,150
my beauty.

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,480
You...

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
You waited for me?

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,430
I've caught

10
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,310
the emperor's
beloved woman.

11
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,710
Once he steps into
Lvcheng Mountain,

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,590
he won't get out of my hand.

13
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,710
Do you know who his
most beloved woman is?

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,510
All bad emperors
love scheming women.

15
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
She

16
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,710
is so pure

17
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,150
whereas you

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,590
have a scheming face.

19
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,000
It has to be you.

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
My prince,

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
am I right?

22
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,520
Jerk!

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,800
You deserve

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,030
a terrible life like this.

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,680
Ai-yo.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
My prince.

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,630
I spent ten years

28
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,120
reading books.

29
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,470
I was entrusted
by the late emperor

30
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,430
to assist your ruling.

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,470
All I wish is
to re-glorify Guazhou.

32
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,800
This insult

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,430
is way too hurtful.

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,610
Ai-yo-yo.

35
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,990
Your Majesty,

36
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm sinned.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
I

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,460
have failed you.

39
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Soldiers,

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,910
send him to the late emperor.

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Aye.

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,030
Your Majesty!

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm sinned!

44
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,750
He...

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,080
He's taken away for that?

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Um...

47
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,820
- My lord?
- Hmm?

48
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,080
You wish
to find the emperor?

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
I know him.

50
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,870
I know him very well.

51
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,240
You?

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
You wish
to find the emperor,

53
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,880
I can help you.

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,620
The emperor

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,610
is coming.

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,430
Huh?

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
Sister, be patient.

58
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,190
We'll be untied soon.

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,030
OK. He's asleep.

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,270
Come on. Come on.

61
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,150
Come on.

62
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,750
Sister, just a second.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
I'll be quick.

64
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,590
Run away?

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,990
No.

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,870
Raze this place!

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
But...

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,360
But we were

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,200
drugged.

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
What do you mean?

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,960
She means

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,110
we have no strength
to run away,

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,720
Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

74
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,110
Ugh.

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,160
Like I said,

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,270
one can't be impulsive,

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,830
right?

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Sigh.

79
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,030
My lord,

80
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,680
you're a man of leniency.

81
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,720
Please don't mind.

82
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,000
Please.

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,200
Hey.

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,070
You're interested
in handicraft?

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Me, too.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,160
I make river lanterns.

87
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,510
Can you make that?

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,190
Come closer.

89
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,030
Whoa.

90
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,520
- I...
- Whoa.

91
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,110
Thank you, man.

92
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,190
Take a good look.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,880
Wow.

94
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,310
How is life

95
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,710
in Guazhou?

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,310
Do you need a princess?

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
How about me?

98
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,910
No.

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Only me.

100
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,270
Only you?

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,190
Poor guy.

102
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Hey.

103
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,600
If I'm not mistaken,

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,120
you want
to find the emperor?

105
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,950
The emperor

106
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,870
isn't here yet.

107
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,950
Now,

108
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,070
you don't say he isn't here.

109
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,750
You say, "He hasn't been found."

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Look,

111
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,270
how about

112
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
I give you a hand?

113
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
My friends over there.

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,480
One is brainless.

115
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,600
The other is trouble-less.

116
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,480
They are not

117
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,270
capable of anything.

118
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,870
They are harmless.

119
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,360
Would you think about

120
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,970
setting them free?

121
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,150
How about this?

122
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,430
You set them free,

123
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,510
I'll tell you
where the emperor is.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
No. Su Qin, no.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
Shut up.

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm telling a story

127
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,410
to his lordship.

128
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,800
How about it?

129
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Untie them.

130
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,590
Hey.

131
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,800
This is a nice-looking blade.

132
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,880
May I

133
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,780
touch it?

134
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,350
Sure.

135
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,630
It's a bit heavy.

136
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
It's pretty cool.

137
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,870
It's a scimitar, right?

138
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
I...

139
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
I didn't mean to...

140
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,390
My favorite!

141
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,310
Put-Put down the blade!

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Stop!

143
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Lu Huan.

144
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
You are

145
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,270
the emperor?

146
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,710
No.

147
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,950
You are.

148
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Go, all of you.

149
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,790
Gu,

150
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,870
keep His Majesty safe.

151
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,520
Go, now.

152
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,780
Lu Huan.

153
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
They can go.

154
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,940
But not you.

155
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,100
