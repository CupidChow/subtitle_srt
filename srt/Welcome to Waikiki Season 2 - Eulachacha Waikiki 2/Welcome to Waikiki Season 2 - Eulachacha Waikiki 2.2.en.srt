1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,875
Han Suyeon.

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:04,985
Why are you here?

3
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:06,798
Who... Who are you, guys?

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:08,679
How do you know my name?

5
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:11,084
You really don't remember us?

6
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,130
Huam High School, Class 2-3.

7
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,509
We were in the same class, remember?

8
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:18,022
It's me. Kibong.

9
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:19,325
The ace of baseball club.

10
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:21,549
I won the best player award at Bohwang
High School Championship.

11
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:26,375
She doesn't remember you, idiot.

12
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:28,364
How about me?

13
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,682
It's me, Lee Jungi.

14
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:31,280
The handsome one from the drama club.

15
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,423
Gosh, how frustrating.

16
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,646
Wait a second.

17
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,450
Are you the one who said
you wanted to act, but was really bad.

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,317
That Lee Jungi?

19
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,823
That's right. It's him.

20
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:42,933
-You're Kook Kibong, right?
-Yes. Yes.

21
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,586
Yes, he's Kook Kibong.

22
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,061
You remember us now.

23
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,069
How about him?

24
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:50,711
Don't you remember him?

25
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,217
He's in band, and always
carried around a guitar.

26
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,325
He was the lead singer of Volcano.

27
00:00:57,764 --> 00:00:58,370
Cha Wooshik?

28
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,881
That's right. Now you remember all of us.

29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,175
Oh, right. You remember the masked singer
who sang at your wedding earlier?

30
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:06,914
That was him.

31
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:08,685
We enjoyed your performance.

32
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,313
That was really you?

33
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,250
Huh?

34
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:13,574
Well...

35
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:16,077
What...

36
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:17,825
What happened to you?

37
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:19,173
Why are you here?

38
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,109
Huh?

39
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:23,507
I...

40
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,504
I don't really know either.

41
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,920
I don't know.

42
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,316
Okay, to make it short...

43
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:46,947
...the creditors were chasing Suyeon...

44
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:49,330
...and she hid in Rebecca coincidentally.

45
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,026
Isn't it such a great coincidence...

46
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:51,901
No. No.

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,875
This is fate.

48
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:53,833
Fate.

49
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,594
Shut it.
Fate, my foot.

50
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,724
Why not?
We were united with our first love.

51
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,260
What's wrong?

52
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,866
They're not picking up?
Not even the groom?

53
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:02,974
No.

54
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,595
Thanks for letting me use
your phone, Kibong.

55
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:08,233
I'm gonna leave then. I'm worried
about my dad, I can't stay here.

56
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:09,544
-Wait.
-Wait.

57
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,933
You said you can't get in touch with him.
Where will you go?

58
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:13,445
I need to go home first.

59
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,536
The creditors are probably staking out
in front of your house.

60
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,713
Do you think he'd be there?

61
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:17,801
You're right.

62
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,555
Then, what do I do?

63
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:20,691
Then...

64
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,908
...why don't you stay here
for the night...

65
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:26,052
-What do you mean by "stay here tonight"?
-She doesn't have anywhere to go.

66
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,015
-Still, this is ridiculous.
-No.

67
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,942
The second floor is comfortable and nice.
Let's go.

68
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,343
-No, it's fine.
-No, no. This is nothing.

69
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,663
I'm back.

70
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:36,793
Hi.

71
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:37,775
Who's this?

72
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:38,900
This is Suyeon...

73
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,415
Whatever. It's a long story.

74
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:42,749
-Later. Let's go, Suyeon.
-Get some rest.

75
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,413
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

76
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:45,605
Suyeon?

77
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:48,387
I've heard that name a lot before.

78
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:51,114
Where have I heard her name?

79
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:54,925
Wait a second.

80
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:58,837
That girl is the 'first love'
from the yearbook, right?

81
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:00,694
Why is she here?

82
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,573
Why is she in a wedding dress?

83
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,015
Hey!

84
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:06,633
Tell me before you leave.

85
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,750
"Waikiki,
Enjoy Today"

86
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,721
What are you guys doing
so early in the morning?

87
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:15,911
-Is there a fashion show or something?
-Hey, punk.

88
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,790
We met our first love
for the first time in 10 years.

89
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,818
We should leave a good impression.

90
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,242
Hey, look.

91
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,032
You can't see my nose hair anymore, right?

92
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,016
No, I can't.

93
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:27,876
How do I look?

94
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,643
You look fine,

95
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,202
-but something is missing.
-Is that so?

96
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,209
Hold on.

97
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,542
That's it. My friend looks dashing now.
You're not missing a thing.

98
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,159
That's true.

99
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:44,468
I'm not missing a thing.

100
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,310
By the way, don't you think
Suyeon is as beautiful as ever, right?

101
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,793
She's gotten prettier than before.

102
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:49,872
I know, right?

103
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,542
Get it together!

104
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:54,609
We're about to be kicked out
for not paying rent.

105
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,258
-We have no time for first love.
-Hey!

106
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,322
-Don't say that in front of Suyeon. Okay?
-Shhh.

107
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:02,513
Why not? You don't want to show
Suyeon your pathetic side?

108
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,515
Of course not.

109
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,407
That is what first love is for men.

110
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:10,563
You always want to show
them your best self.

111
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,159
You want to leave them
with the best memories.

112
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,970
Something like that. Got it?

113
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,713
So, tell Suyeon that I'm
a really popular actor, okay?

114
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,459
Tell her that I'm a
successful baseball player,

115
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,592
but I'm temporarily in the minor league
because of an injury.

116
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:23,893
That's a good idea.

117
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,937
Do you really want to do that
considering our situation?

118
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:27,137
You're just...

119
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,453
...putting up a show.

120
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,225
That's the most pathetic thing
in the world.

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,229
-You know that?
-I know!

122
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,717
-You do?
-Who cares?

123
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:35,091
Is this the time to talk
about "first love?"

124
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,097
We shouldn't be blabbering
about first loves right now.

125
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:38,917
What are we going to do about rent?

126
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,024
It's really hard for me...

127
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,480
...to keep dating the landlady.

128
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,868
She wants to go to the theme park again.

129
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,590
Just be patient.

130
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:50,997
We'll try to get the money
one way or another.

131
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,469
Forget about that. Suyeon must be hungry.

132
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:56,014
-Shall we wake her up and make breakfast?
-Shall we?

133
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:57,468
Great. Let's go.

134
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:00,340
Come join us for breakfast later, Sir?

135
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:03,906
Let's go.

136
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,991
I'll wake up Suyeon.

137
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
My hair's looking good.

138
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,068
Jeongpal, where are you going
so early in the morning?

139
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,527
I'm going to a new part-time job.

140
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:16,231
Anyway, what's with those sunglasses?

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,944
I bought it with
an 80-month installment plan.

142
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,225
Oh my god!

143
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,232
What's this? Why's she sleeping here?

144
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,143
It's Suyeon.

145
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,138
Suyeon, wake up.

146
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,384
Suyeon.

147
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,797
Why are you sleeping here?

148
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,574
Good morning.

149
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,028
I must've fallen asleep
while I was calling my dad.

150
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:39,797
Oh, I see.

151
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,523
But, is he still not picking up?

152
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:42,507
No.

153
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:46,347
By the way, is this phone broken?

154
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,766
-It keeps getting disconnected.
-What? That's not possible.

155
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:51,918
This is Gulliver. It has bad connection.

156
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,896
If you look at this,
there's a reason why the cord is long.

157
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:58,077
Look, you hate to step on it like this
and bite it.

158
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,926
Ta-da. I'm one with Gulliver.

159
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,378
Yeah, Gulliver.

160
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,838
This is how you use it.

161
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,254
Is that so?

162
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,564
Why didn't you change your clothes?

163
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,039
Is it because men's clothes
are uncomfortable?

164
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:11,140
Or, do you want to borrow
Jeongeun's clothes instead?

165
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,972
-No, it's fine.
-I agree with that.

166
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,391
That's a wise choice.

167
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:18,204
What was that?

168
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:20,206
Did she just look down on me? Right?

169
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,198
I mean, is my style so weird?

170
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:25,098
-What time is it now?
-I think my arm is asleep.

171
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,471
Never mind. Forget it.

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,820
You guys should look at yourselves.

173
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,248
She got upset again.

174
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,380
Suyeon.

175
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,563
Suyeon-San.

176
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,605
I'm sure you'll get to call him soon.

177
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:43,908
Don't worry too much.

178
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:44,858
Yeah.

179
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:45,842
I hope so.

180
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,790
-By the way, what happened to that?
-What?

181
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,108
Like we said last night, a meteor fell.

182
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:53,290
I see.

183
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:58,025
We put that there to cover the hole.

184
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,554
I see.

185
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:05,428
It's been so long.

186
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,253
How have you all been?

187
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:09,815
Huh?

188
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,253
Well, I'm an actor. An actor.

189
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:16,894
Actor.

190
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:20,082
These days, I've been
filming movies and dramas.

191
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:22,668
-What?
-Plus, I've been working with Hun.

192
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:23,887
You know him, right?

193
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:26,202
-Hun?
-"Tell me, why did you do that to me?"

194
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,317
Hun.

195
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,482
Lee Byunghun.

196
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,335
-Wow, that's amazing.
-It's nothing.

197
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,608
How about you, Kibong?

198
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:33,561
Me?

199
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:36,714
I'm a pitcher.

200
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,117
A professional baseball pitcher.

201
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:40,838
I'm playing with the minor league
temporarily because of my injury.

202
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:44,298
But, those at the major league
kept telling me to come back fast.

203
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:46,501
You guys said you were busy.

204
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,803
Don't you have to leave?

205
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,445
We're about to leave now.

206
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:50,535
Bye, Suyeon.

207
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,648
-I'm off to training.
-I'm also off to a shooting.

208
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:55,409
Call us if you need anything.

209
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,152
That's been bothering me.

210
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:02,467
-Let's move this.
-Okay.

211
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,862
One, two, three.

212
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:07,596
Done.

213
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:11,230
The hole doesn't look nice, you know.

214
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:14,363
-See you later.
-Bye.

215
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,047
-Sure. Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

216
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,272
Bye.

217
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,352
Seems like they're both successful.

218
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,184
What about you, Wooshik?

219
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:25,403
What?

220
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,783
Well, I'm...

221
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:32,731
I'm a singer.

222
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:34,079
A musician.

223
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:35,093
A singer?

224
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,417
So that's why you sang at my wedding?

225
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:39,355
What?

226
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,452
About that...

227
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,037
The wedding planner is a friend of mine,
and she practically begged me to do it.

228
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,808
So I had no choice but to agree.

229
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,284
I see.

230
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:51,078
Oh, right. The MC said you
were going to debut soon.

231
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,019
What?

232
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:54,098
That one...

233
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:59,637
I already did.
In a three-member co-ed dance group.

234
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:01,452
We're called Taj Mahal.

235
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,251
Get off quickly.

236
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,149
Excuse me.
Can I quickly go to the bathroom first?

237
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,027
-Sure. Make it quick.
-Thank you.

238
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,910
-Hey, stunt team!
-Yes, director?

239
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,887
Why did you guys just arrive?
Hurry up!

240
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,876
Yes, Director. We're coming.

241
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,546
-You can't go. The director is furious.
-What are you waiting for?!

242
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,873
-Let's hurry up.
-But...

243
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,013
I won't take long.

244
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:28,453
Can't you see the director is enraged?

245
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,625
Let's go. Quickly!

246
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:32,088
-Wait... Hold on.
-Director, we're coming.

247
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:33,494
I really need to go though.

248
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,408
This is driving me crazy.

249
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,813
-Hurry up!
-I'm coming.

250
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:44,469
Not too long ago, I got a call
from BTS to feature in their song.

251
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:45,956
You know BTS, right?

252
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,311
The Bangtan Boys.

253
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:51,658
I used to perform with
them a long time ago.

254
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:53,556
Did I tell you about
the nationwide tour that I did?

255
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,508
You did. You told me everything.

256
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:56,548
Anyway...

257
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:58,479
...after working nonstop...

258
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:01,482
...it really took a toll on me.

259
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:03,826
So, now I'm taking a short break...

260
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,449
...to recharge myself.

261
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,266
You said you're a singer.

262
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,639
-Then why did you start this guest house?
-What?

263
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,175
Well...

264
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:16,217
Many foreigners come here.

265
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:17,947
So I invested in this place because...

266
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:21,013
...I want to mingle with them
and develop a global mindset.

267
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:22,818
I see.

268
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,737
You've succeeded too, Wooshik.

269
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,592
Gosh. Cut it out.

270
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,227
What about you?

271
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,447
How have you been doing?

272
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,398
Me?

273
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,018
I've been doing well.

274
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:39,862
Well...

275
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,956
...even though it turned out
like this now.

276
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,328
What's your husband like?

277
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,770
Minseok?

278
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,651
He's a really good person.

279
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,765
He's very kind to me.

280
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,215
He really cares about me.

281
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,028
I'm glad to hear that.

282
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,457
What about you?

283
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,017
Do you have a girlfriend?

284
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,139
A girlfriend?

285
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,167
Of course, I do.

286
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:08,229
" Who?", you ask?

287
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:09,869
Music.

288
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,439
I'm...

289
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:13,096
...married to the music.

290
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,034
Wooshik.

291
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:23,811
Hello, Ma'am.

292
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:25,050
Why are you here so early?

293
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,464
I came because I missed you.

294
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:32,386
-But, who's this?
-Huh?

295
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,250
This is my friend.
We went to the same high school.

296
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,338
But, her clothes...

297
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,418
About that...

298
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,048
She has her own reasons.

299
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,292
Wooshik, who is this?

300
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:44,919
Hello.

301
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,658
I'm currently seeing Wooshik.
My name is Kim Jeongsook.

302
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:49,000
We started three days ago.

303
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,086
What?

304
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:54,026
I see.

305
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,382
Wooshik,

306
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,858
you haven't had
breakfast yet, right?

307
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,766
I bought ingredients for
ginseng chicken soup.

308
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:01,358
I'll prepare it right away.

309
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,338
I'm not hungry. Not at all.

310
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,896
Nonsense. You can always eat it later.

311
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,436
You fool.

312
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:09,690
Just wait for a bit.

313
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm fine, though. There's really no need.

314
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,739
Wooshik, she's seeing you?
What's that supposed to mean?

315
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:17,120
So she's your girlfriend?

316
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,272
Well...

317
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,935
But you said you
don't have any girlfriend.

318
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,403
You said you're married to the music.

319
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:24,554
Well, about that...

320
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:29,045
Geez. There she goes again.

321
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:30,815
To tell you the truth...

322
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:32,558
...the landlady is not well...

323
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,155
...up here.

324
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:35,495
Here?

325
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,712
-Don't tell me...
-Yes...

326
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,163
That's why she thinks I'm her boyfriend.

327
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,067
She said that I look like,

328
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:45,992
the man she used to love before
or something like that.

329
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:47,955
I see.

330
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,170
But, "landlady"?

331
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,498
Aren't you the Ma'am here?

332
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:52,426
Huh?

333
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:53,746
Well...

334
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:58,113
She used to be the building owner
of this guesthouse before.

335
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,819
But, she thinks she still owns it.

336
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,530
So she keeps on coming by.

337
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,004
You should just go along with it.

338
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,036
Got it?

339
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:06,911
She's so pitiable.

340
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,543
Yeah, I got it.

341
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,685
Did you not call your dad yet?

342
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,301
That's right, my dad.

343
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:14,074
-I should call him again.
-Yeah, you should.

344
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:17,881
This is driving me insane.

345
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,031
Gosh.

346
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:21,229
Ma'am...

347
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,278
...you must be tired.
You didn't have to do all this.

348
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:25,053
Let's just eat outside.

349
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:27,909
No. I'm the one who wanted to do this. Me.

350
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:30,316
But, still. You must be tired.

351
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:31,707
Let's just eat out. Okay?

352
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:34,974
Wooshik,

353
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,370
are you dismissing my sincerity right now?

354
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:38,534
No.

355
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:39,887
I should eat it.

356
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,058
I will.

357
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:42,915
You should've said that earlier.

358
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:45,436
Dear me, I'm so forgetful.

359
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:47,737
I forgot to buy some green onions.

360
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,387
Wooshik, do you have green onions at home?

361
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,835
Green onions? No, we don't.

362
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,406
Then, could you go and
buy some green onions?

363
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,723
Ginseng chicken soup won't be
complete without green onions.

364
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,751
Make it quick.

365
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,069
Alright.

366
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,018
Yes, my son?

367
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:10,761
Me?

368
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,314
I'm at Wooshik's house.

369
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:14,882
What?

370
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:15,951
You're sick?

371
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,520
Where?

372
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:18,858
So?

373
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,180
Where does it hurt the most?

374
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:23,777
Your legs?

375
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:26,692
Gosh, you're all grown up.
Don't be such a crybaby.

376
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,147
Do you want me to massage your legs?

377
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,034
You don't want that?

378
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:35,088
You want acupuncture, then?

379
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:38,530
Just hold it in then.

380
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,065
If you get acupuncture,

381
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,352
and take a nice hot bath,

382
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:46,403
you'll feel much better.

383
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:51,089
Okay.

384
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,593
Then, go get some rest.

385
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:56,228
Oh, my.

386
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,690
What do we do?

387
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:02,700
What was that?

388
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:03,944
What's wrong with her?

389
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,374
I have to pee.

390
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:15,540
I'm going to go insane.

391
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,504
Gosh.

392
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:18,548
We're done setting up.
Why isn't Min here yet?

393
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,998
He said he had to make a call.

394
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,477
We have no time here and yet,
he's making a call?.

395
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,619
Does he have any conscience or not?

396
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:25,931
I apologize.

397
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,518
The lead actor isn't here yet.

398
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,898
Should I ask if I can use the bathroom?

399
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:32,056
-Excuse me...
-Director.

400
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,927
Can I use the bathroom really quick?

401
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,126
Bathroom?

402
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,911
Is he out of his mind or something?

403
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:41,368
We'll start filming soon.

404
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:43,678
Do you expect the staff
to wait for you to pee?

405
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:44,706
Assistant director...

406
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:46,009
...fire him right now.

407
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,493
I can't work with a selfish person
Ike him, so fire him.

408
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:50,978
Yes, Director. I apologize.

409
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:53,315
-You, leave.
-Hurry up!

410
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,566
I'm sorry, Director.
Can you give me one more chance?

411
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:57,165
Hurry, drag him out!

412
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,271
Don't put him in any
of my projects in the future?

413
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:00,161
Understand?

414
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:01,297
Take him out.

415
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,220
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

416
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:03,667
I think I don't need to go
to the bathroom anymore.

417
00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:05,819
-You just go live in the bathroom forever!
-I'll do my best.

418
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:06,881
Director!

419
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:07,863
What's this?

420
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:09,572
-Do you have something to say as well?
-What?

421
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:13,849
No, I don't.

422
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,762
Let's do this!

423
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,035
Gosh, that was out of the blue.

424
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:22,825
These so-called actors
are not professional at all.

425
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,498
I'm so sorry.

426
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:27,999
Oh, Min!

427
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,686
I'm late, right?

428
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,139
My puppy was sick,
so I was talking to him on the phone.

429
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,185
No, no. It's fine.

430
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,623
This shooting isn't that important.

431
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,593
Your sick puppy is more important.

432
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,918
Thank you for understanding, Director.

433
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,569
No, no. Don't mention it.

434
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:49,825
I'm more grateful
to be working with a top star like you.

435
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:50,708
Anyway...

436
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:54,030
...let's make a great
scene together, got it?

437
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:55,766
Okay?

438
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:57,151
Okay?

439
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,463
Okay?

440
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,134
What are you doing right now?

441
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,055
Huh?

442
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:07,490
I was expressing my affections.

443
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,689
I don't like that.

444
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:16,719
You can do this.

445
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,107
Lee Jungi, you can do this!

446
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,722
Alright, ready.

447
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:21,330
Action!

448
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,484
Are you Bidam?

449
00:17:30,324 --> 00:17:31,186
Yes, I am.

450
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:33,021
Do you need something from me?

451
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:33,957
Yes,

452
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,141
I do.

453
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,195
My master wants me to bring...

454
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,221
-...your head...
-Director. Director.

455
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,606
Hold on.

456
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:41,471
Cut!

457
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:42,985
Why? What's wrong?

458
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:44,283
What's the matter, Min?

459
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,081
What is it?

460
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,244
I think this scene is a bit boring.

461
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,915
-Instead of him simply saying his line,
-Okay.

462
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,956
how about he takes my drink away...

463
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:55,955
...and drinks it?

464
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,462
He takes the drink away and drinks it?

465
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,713
That's such a good idea.

466
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:05,781
Top stars are rally on a different level.

467
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:06,917
Okay?

468
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:08,098
Okay?

469
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,207
Okay?

470
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,792
Stop it. What's wrong with you?

471
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:14,110
Sorry. I'm sorry.

472
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,424
Alright, so like Min said,

473
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,828
take his drink away and drink it,

474
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,218
and then start your lines. Okay?

475
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,103
-Alright, let's start.
-Hold on.

476
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,075
Are you...

477
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,001
...telling me to drink this right now?

478
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:29,676
Why?

479
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:31,262
You don't want to do it?

480
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:32,875
No,

481
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:34,331
I want to.

482
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:38,443
Scene 35, 1-2.

483
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:40,041
Action!

484
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:56,108
Are you Bidam?

485
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,208
So, what if I am?

486
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:58,165
Cut!

487
00:18:58,787 --> 00:18:59,846
Well...

488
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,438
Min, it's not, "So, what if I am?"

489
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:03,337
It's "Yes, I am".

490
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:04,455
"Yes, I am."

491
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,406
Okay?

492
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:07,976
"Yes, I am."

493
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,442
-I'm sorry. Let's do it again.
-Again?

494
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,656
"Yes, I am." Okay.

495
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,345
Let's do it again.

496
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:28,352
Are you Bidam?

497
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:29,797
-It's so dusty.
-Cut!

498
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,938
Can you do something about the dust?
I can't act like this.

499
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,484
-I also can't...
-Take four.

500
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,871
-Are you Bidam?
-There are bugs.

501
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,407
-Can someone catch the bugs?
-Take five.

502
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,937
-Are you Bidam?
-Let's do it again.

503
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:46,484
Again?

504
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:48,357
I'm full.

505
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,338
-Are you Bidam?
-Again. Let's do it again.

506
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:51,896
Let's do it again.

507
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:52,791
"Scene 35
Take 13"

508
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:12,261
Are you Bidam?

509
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,590
Yes, I am.

510
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:16,237
Do you need something from me?

511
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:17,172
Yes,

512
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:19,106
I do. I really do.

513
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,739
My master wants me to bring...

514
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:23,201
...your head!

515
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,131
Cut!

516
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,089
Hey.

517
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:26,757
What are you doing right now?

518
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:32,048
Why are you crossing your legs?

519
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,499
Did you come here to seduce him?

520
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:35,299
Are you his mistress?

521
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:37,396
You're an assassin.

522
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,708
Why is an assassin
sitting sexily like that?

523
00:20:39,796 --> 00:20:40,824
I'm sorry.

524
00:20:41,316 --> 00:20:43,048
We'll start again from the drinking part.

525
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:44,399
Fill up drink quickly.

526
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,566
Hurry up and fill it.

527
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,126
Fill it up to the brim.

528
00:20:51,436 --> 00:20:53,047
That sound...

529
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:02,895
Eat up, Wooshik.

530
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:04,700
Yes.
Thank you.

531
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,804
I was about to call you over.

532
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,381
Have a seat and eat with us.

533
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,877
No, no. I asked her earlier,
and she said she wasn't hungry.

534
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,048
No, Wooshik.

535
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:19,384
She is not well, and yet she prepared it
with so much effort.

536
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:20,859
I should eat.

537
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,288
Thank you for the food.

538
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,951
It looks good. Suyeon, eat up.

539
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,493
Ma'am, eat up.

540
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:35,177
Yes, yes.

541
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,463
-You seem to like it.
-Oh, yes.

542
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:39,775
Slow down.

543
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:40,929
It's delicious.

544
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:43,876
This is driving me crazy.

545
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,192
How is it?

546
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:49,558
Is it good?

547
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:53,735
My goodness.

548
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:54,787
What's wrong?

549
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:57,291
There's something on your face.

550
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:00,141
Hold on. I'll wipe it for you.

551
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:10,925
If it's hard for you to eat,
should I feed you?

552
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:12,142
What?

553
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:14,506
No.

554
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,690
That's not necessary.

555
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:19,128
Then, should I at least
debone the chicken for you?

556
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,728
No.

557
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:23,073
I can eat by myself.

558
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:25,063
Of course.

559
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,517
I've seen on TV,

560
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:31,141
they say that even if it's hard,
it's best to try by yourself.

561
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:34,642
If you would excuse me.

562
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,640
Thank you for the meal.

563
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:43,985
How pitiful that she got such a disease...

564
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,106
A disease?

565
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:49,227
Honey, what is your friend talking about?

566
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,799
Why would she wipe my face,

567
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,742
and offer to feed me?

568
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:55,505
What's wrong with her?

569
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:56,944
About that.

570
00:22:57,648 --> 00:22:59,016
The thing is...

571
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,926
Geez. There she goes again.

572
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,230
To tell you the truth...

573
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,702
...she is not that well...

574
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,178
...up here.

575
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:08,354
Up here?

576
00:23:11,272 --> 00:23:12,699
Don't tell me she's...

577
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:16,903
How did that happen?

578
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,125
Since her wedding fell apart,

579
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:20,771
she was traumatized.

580
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,280
-Really?
-Yes.

581
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:28,039
Alright, since we don't have time,

582
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:30,204
we're going to do it
in one take this time, okay?

583
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,238
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

584
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,750
-Let's go.
-Action.

585
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,214
Cut, cut, cut. Cut!

586
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:43,331
What are you doing?

587
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:45,470
Why are you running like that?

588
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,414
-Are you giving him a warning first?
-I'm sorry.

589
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,185
Be more aggressive.

590
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:52,101
Charge at him with all you've got.

591
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,611
Let's do it again.
Again.

592
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:54,745
Let's go again!

593
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,455
-Go back quick!
-Yes, sir.

594
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,946
Ready.

595
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,495
Action!

596
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,327
-Hold on, hold on.
-Cut, cut, cut.

597
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:21,391
It's going to come out. Ouch.

598
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,499
He barely hit you.
Why are you overreacting?.

599
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,571
I'm sorry.

600
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,935
We're running out of time.
Are you going to keep doing this?

601
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:31,665
If you do this one more time,
we'll change the actor. Do it properly.

602
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,600
No.

603
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,311
I can do it.

604
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,631
No, I'll do it.

605
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,283
Let's do it!

606
00:24:37,863 --> 00:24:39,359
I'll hold it in even if I die.

607
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,421
I went through so much to get this role.

608
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:53,791
Ma'am, why don't we go
have coffee outside?

609
00:24:54,008 --> 00:24:55,346
There's no need.

610
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,993
I ground the beans just to give it to you.

611
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:02,407
It smells so nice, right?

612
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,397
What?

613
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,095
It smells nice.

614
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:06,582
I'm back.

615
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:08,295
Ma'am.

616
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,800
Jeongeun, you're here.

617
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,134
Would you like a cup of coffee?

618
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:11,980
Sorry?

619
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:13,538
No, I'm fine.

620
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:16,218
Don't be like that. Have a cup with us.

621
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:25,925
Poor girl.

622
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:27,592
What? What are you talking about?

623
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:29,326
That girl over there.

624
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,284
I heard there's something wrong up here.

625
00:25:32,373 --> 00:25:33,935
What? Suyeon?

626
00:25:34,023 --> 00:25:35,055
Didn't you know?

627
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:37,311
She's insane.

628
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:39,754
-That's what Wooshik said.
-What?

629
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:41,303
That doesn't make...

630
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:42,755
Have you done the favor
I asked from you?

631
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:43,988
Favor? What favor?

632
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,575
How could you forget about that?

633
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:48,065
-What?
-Let's go talk for a bit.

634
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:49,974
What's wrong?
Why are you being like this?

635
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,681
What a manly man.

636
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:54,049
What?

637
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:56,005
Suyeon thinks the landlady is crazy,

638
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:58,907
-and the landlady thinks Suyeon is crazy?
-Yes.

639
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:01,402
Why would you lie
about something like that?

640
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,778
A successful singer?

641
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,267
You're "married to the music"?

642
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:05,644
Jeongeun.

643
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,117
That is what first love is for men.

644
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:10,375
You always want to show
them your best self.

645
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,581
You want to leave them
with the best memories.

646
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,592
Shut up!

647
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,035
You've all  lost you minds
over your first love.

648
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,215
Anyway, act like you don't know.

649
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,994
If I'm caught, I'm dead.
You know that, right?

650
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,974
Alright, throw it ten more times,
then we'll end the practice.

651
00:26:28,063 --> 00:26:28,914
Yes, Coach.

652
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:30,382
Excuse me, Coach.

653
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:32,441
Well if it isn't our rising star.

654
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,108
Practice ended. Why did you come back?

655
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:37,298
I went to the shower,
but there is no water coming out.

656
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,912
I think the shower head is broken.
What do we do?

657
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,961
That won't do.

658
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:43,032
Kibong.

659
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:44,768
Why don't you go and fix it.

660
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:47,242
-Me?
-Then, should I fix it?

661
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,126
There are a lot of shower stalls.
Use the other ones.

662
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:57,039
After I practice, I have to shower
in the third stall from the right.

663
00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:58,373
It's a routine.

664
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:00,587
-Routine?
-If not, I get bothered by it,

665
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,154
and it affects my condition.

666
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:03,222
What are you doing?

667
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,512
Go and fix it.

668
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,538
-I'm not even done with practice.
-Your practice isn't even important.

669
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,816
This one is going to get
drafted to the major league soon.

670
00:27:09,904 --> 00:27:11,826
If he's in bad condition
and didn't get drafted,

671
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:13,312
will you take responsibility?

672
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:14,599
Alright, then.

673
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:16,435
I'll just fix it.

674
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:17,836
You brat.

675
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:23,349
Why does he want me to fix this?

676
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,461
I guess if you're not a rising star
you have to do tedious tasks like these.

677
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:29,086
What?

678
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,758
Why isn't it coming out?

679
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:37,801
What is this?

680
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,635
I think something is stuck inside.

681
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,550
It's stuck there very tight.

682
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,494
I need to block it.

683
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:54,276
I need to block it, even if I die.

684
00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:57,516
The most important part of
the scene is your gaze.

685
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:59,957
Look at your opponent
as if you're going to kill them.

686
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,267
You need that psychopathic gaze.

687
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:03,187
Give me a scene like that.

688
00:28:03,276 --> 00:28:04,916
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

689
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,520
This is my last scene.

690
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:10,548
I need to end it in one go.

691
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:12,823
In one go.

692
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:14,057
Ready?

693
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,464
Action.

694
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:20,514
Cut!

695
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,032
Director, I apologize.

696
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,086
Why is my shoe over here?

697
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:27,916
We don't have much time. Seriously.

698
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:30,336
What is the costume team doing?

699
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,423
Min.

700
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,446
We don't have time.

701
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:34,776
So, please focus, okay?

702
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:37,200
Kang Min, come to your senses.

703
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:38,767
Are you going to be like this all day?

704
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,218
We have no time.

705
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:45,602
Let me live.

706
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:50,346
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

707
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:54,404
Shut up. Go film already, Director.

708
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,524
What's wrong with you?

709
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:03,748
Are you immersed in your role?

710
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:05,771
Everyone saw that, right?

711
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,403
That's the gaze I'm talking about!

712
00:29:07,524 --> 00:29:08,581
Shut up.

713
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:12,514
You're distracting me
when I need to concentrate!

714
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:13,337
Go!

715
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,346
Let's hurry and film before
you break out of character.

716
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:17,199
-That was great. Great.
-Okay.

717
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,136
Let's go.

718
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:19,660
Hurry, get to your spots.

719
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,574
Let's go.

720
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:21,727
Ready.

721
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:23,991
Action!

722
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,306
I'll wait for you in the afterlife...

723
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:47,286
...Bidam.

724
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:55,615
Cut!

725
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:56,926
Okay.

726
00:29:57,014 --> 00:29:58,664
That was great. So great.

727
00:29:58,753 --> 00:29:59,760
Bravo.

728
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,596
-It was nothing.
-That was great.

729
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:05,570
This guy has some true talent for acting.

730
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:09,849
-Are we done?
-Yes. Of course.

731
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:12,049
It's cold. Get up quickly.

732
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,755
That was so great.

733
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,260
Give him a big hand. What are you doing?

734
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:19,866
Your acting was so great.

735
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:21,971
-Good job.
-Don't touch me.

736
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:26,872
I have to go.

737
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,083
I have to go. I must go now.

738
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:31,510
He's...

739
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:32,691
You did a great job.

740
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:35,644
But he's...

741
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:37,889
Hey you, over there.

742
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:43,833
I want to work with you
on my next project. What do you say?

743
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:45,236
Yes, I got it.

744
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:46,160
So...

745
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,517
Can we talk...

746
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:48,431
...about it...

747
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,053
...later? Later.

748
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,097
Where are you going?

749
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,276
Are you playing hard to get?

750
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:55,471
No, I'm...

751
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,299
I'm in a hurry. It's urgent.

752
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:03,158
What on earth is stuck in there?
Why is it not coming out?

753
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,291
What's wrong?

754
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,469
What's wrong?

755
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,176
Let go of me!

756
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:11,056
Okay. Okay.

757
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:14,271
Anyway, your acting today was so great.

758
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,599
It came out.

759
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,098
One drop came out.

760
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:31,446
-It's coming out.
-It's coming out.

761
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:33,788
That's good. One more drop.

762
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:39,080
A little more, a little more.

763
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:51,101
I did it! It's coming out!
It came out. Come out.

764
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,454
Hey...

765
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:01,455
What's wrong with your expression?

766
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:03,379
What's wrong with you?

767
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:06,538
What the heck?

768
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:09,416
Why is there water?

769
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,736
Don't tell me you just...

770
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,489
...peed in your pants?

771
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,929
-What's wrong with him?
-His pants are wet.

772
00:32:23,624 --> 00:32:26,343
-Why is it wet?
-What's up with him?

773
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,893
-That's disgusting.
-I've never seen anything like that.

774
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:31,481
Did you see that?

775
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,215
-This color suits you so well. Right?
-What?

776
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,614
Yes, it does.

777
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:40,565
Ma'am, I think you should go now.
It's getting late.

778
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,509
Gosh.

779
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:43,366
I didn't realize it's so late.

780
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:47,098
Anyway, when I'm with you,
I just lose the track of time.

781
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,720
You should leave now.

782
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:51,166
I don't want to say goodbye yet.

783
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:53,562
Should I stay the night?

784
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:56,003
Excuse me? What nonsense...

785
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:58,093
Your sons are waiting for you.

786
00:32:58,182 --> 00:32:59,785
I was kidding.

787
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:03,333
But, you'll take me back
to my place, right?

788
00:33:03,923 --> 00:33:05,733
Yes. Of course.

789
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:08,020
I'll go get my coat.

790
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,832
He's so cute.

791
00:33:14,296 --> 00:33:15,155
Geez.

792
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:18,628
Because of my successful junior,
I had to fix the shower.

793
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:23,500
It's so dirty and cheap that
I'm going to succeed and show them.

794
00:33:23,942 --> 00:33:24,780
Oh my god.

795
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:26,727
What's that?

796
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:33,912
What is this?

797
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,382
Is he a crazy man?

798
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,318
-Jungi.
-Kibong.

799
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,125
What are you doing here?

800
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:48,118
-And what's up with the outfit?
-Kibong.

801
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:50,309
What's wrong with you? What happened?

802
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,334
What smell is this?

803
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:58,450
Jungi.

804
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:03,096
Jungi. Don't move. Stay still.

805
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:04,753
Seriously.

806
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:10,220
What should I do with you?

807
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:15,122
What is going on here?

808
00:34:15,211 --> 00:34:17,447
Why did they leave the plant there?

809
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,057
And what is up with that?

810
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,823
Why did they put a picture up there?
It looks messy.

811
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:25,020
That?

812
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,936
A meteorite fell through, so
they put those there to hide the holes.

813
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:28,868
What?

814
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:30,805
A meteorite?

815
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,135
Yes.

816
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,914
You don't know what a meteorite is?

817
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:35,746
It's a rock that comes from space.

818
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:38,184
Oh my gosh. You poor thing.

819
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,954
Get well soon, miss.

820
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,381
You have such a pretty face,

821
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,745
but how did you lose your mind?

822
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:49,714
Sorry?

823
00:34:49,843 --> 00:34:51,650
Who lost their mind?

824
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,406
-Me?
-Then, was I talking about myself?

825
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,525
Forget it. Never mind.

826
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:59,222
Why am I talking to someone
who lost their mind?

827
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,468
What is this you keep talking about?

828
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:03,938
Wow, I'm speechless.

829
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,838
Forget it.

830
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:08,034
A crazy person would think
everyone else is crazy.

831
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:08,979
What?

832
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:11,039
A crazy person?

833
00:35:11,128 --> 00:35:11,848
Who?

834
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:12,686
Me?

835
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:14,545
Then, was I referring to myself?

836
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:17,996
They really said a meteorite
fell through the ceiling.

837
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,071
Do you want to see?

838
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,056
-Look.
-What is that?

839
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:32,606
This, too.

840
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:37,357
Look.

841
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,049
I wasn't lying, right?

842
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,513
What is that?

843
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:41,886
Ma'am...

844
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:43,257
...let's go.

845
00:35:44,164 --> 00:35:45,141
Wooshik,

846
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:46,647
what is that?

847
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,821
What is all of this?

848
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:51,824
-What happened here?
-Well...

849
00:35:51,913 --> 00:35:52,972
What happened was...

850
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:54,514
We're home.

851
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:58,413
-Ma'am.
-Hello.

852
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:00,464
Why do you look like this?

853
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,475
No, it's not time to talk about this.

854
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:06,769
Then, did you also know?

855
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:10,123
All of you knew,
so you were hiding it from me?

856
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,148
What?

857
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:14,947
Tell me the truth right now.

858
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:24,625
Well, Wooshik, why did you
tell such a lie?

859
00:36:24,714 --> 00:36:28,228
You shouldn't have lied that you love her.

860
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,226
What are you saying now?

861
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,983
He lied about loving me?

862
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:36,410
You were not talking about the love part?

863
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:40,515
Wooshik,

864
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,956
tell me.

865
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:45,360
Did you really lie to me?

866
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,489
The truth is...

867
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,033
What's going on?

868
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:55,374
Why is the atmosphere like this?

869
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:57,213
Jeongeun, did you know about it too?

870
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:00,267
Did you know that Wooshik
was lying to me?

871
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:01,893
Excuse me?

872
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:06,924
Ah, well, I... I...

873
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:09,160
Well...

874
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:14,406
No, but Wooshik, why did you
say the landlady was crazy?

875
00:37:14,494 --> 00:37:18,027
You can't call a normal person
a crazy person like that.

876
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:20,332
-Crazy?
-What is this about?

877
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:22,350
Crazy?

878
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:23,808
Who?

879
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:24,825
Me?

880
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:27,881
Wooshik, then this person is not crazy?

881
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:29,866
You told me she was crazy earlier.

882
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:33,619
Miss, did he also tell you
that I was crazy?

883
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:40,209
Is that true?

884
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:44,536
-Well, I...
-Cha Wooshik!

885
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:45,791
You...

886
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:48,078
You are dead today.

887
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:52,990
-Ma'am.
-Stop her.

888
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:55,911
-Stop. Stop. Stop.
-Ma'am.

889
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:59,457
Ma'am. Ma'am, calm down.

890
00:38:04,461 --> 00:38:06,870
"Notice of Seizure"

891
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,316
"Notice of Seizure"

892
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,728
What should we do now?

893
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:15,956
But still, she didn't
kick us out immediately.

894
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,697
She gave us one day.

895
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:19,576
We should be grateful.

896
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,675
Grateful, my foot.

897
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:26,083
She stuck those stickers and demands
10 million won by the end of the day.

898
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,565
What's the difference between this
and getting kicked out? Huh?

899
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,345
Why did you say such a lie? Why?

900
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,446
I'm sorry. I didn't expect this to happen.

901
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,615
And you went on about
men and their first love.

902
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:35,835
You really showed a good side of you.

903
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:38,087
Why are you like this, too?
I'm going crazy as is.

904
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:41,822
Speaking of which, where are we going
to get that money within a day?

905
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:44,304
-Hey!
-What? Ouch.

906
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:45,599
Be careful!

907
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,842
Is it the time to trim your nose hair?

908
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:49,981
I was thinking while
trimming my nose hair.

909
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:51,590
Do we have any other way?

910
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,196
We should go to someone we know
and explain the situation.

911
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:56,496
I'll ask the players in
my team to lend me money.

912
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:57,509
Same here.

913
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,603
I'll see if I can get a salary advance.

914
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:00,829
Bye.

915
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:01,814
Take care.

916
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:05,885
We should get going too.

917
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:08,600
That's right. Let's move.
There's no point in sitting here.

918
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,044
Let's go.

919
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,415
-Are you bleeding?
-No.

920
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:14,976
Suyeon, do you need something?

921
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,543
No, it's not that.

922
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:18,016
I'll go now.

923
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:18,923
Now?

924
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,942
But, you said you couldn't
contact your father.

925
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:21,880
Where will you go?

926
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:23,968
But still, I should try going home.

927
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:26,240
Speaking of which,

928
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:28,085
can you take me home?

929
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:29,779
What?
Us?

930
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:32,142
I'm sorry, but we have
something urgent right now,

931
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,069
so I don't think we can.

932
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:35,354
Don't be like that and
just give me a ride.

933
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:37,698
I'll give you this in exchange.

934
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:39,260
What's this?

935
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:43,042
Isn't this your wedding dress?

936
00:39:44,204 --> 00:39:46,906
-This is no use to us.
-It's designer brand.

937
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:50,649
If you sell it as used,
it'll worth at least 5 million won.

938
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,134
Forget it, if you don't want it.

939
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:54,871
Where is your house?

940
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,830
-CEO Han, come out.
-Come out. Come out.

941
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:05,895
-Give me my money back!
-Come on out!

942
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:08,166
-You need to pay us back.
-CEO Han, come out!

943
00:40:08,254 --> 00:40:09,838
See, what did I tell you?

944
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,724
I told you that the creditors
will be here, right?

945
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,169
Then, what should I do?

946
00:40:13,862 --> 00:40:16,439
Suyeon, how about we go
to your father's company?

947
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:18,475
There's creditors here.
Do you think they won't be at the company?

948
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:21,427
-I was just asking.
-I'm just saying that it won't be helpful.

949
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:26,704
Then, is there someone that
might know where your father is?

950
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:27,798
Well...

951
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:31,167
That's right. His secretary should know.

952
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:33,498
Really? Then, try calling him. Now.

953
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:37,196
I lost my phone,
so I don't know his phone number.

954
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:41,806
But it might be saved in my old phone.

955
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,611
Really? Where is it?

956
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,607
-In my room, in my dressing table drawer.
-What?

957
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:49,217
Then, are you saying
it's inside the house?

958
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:50,567
Yes.

959
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:55,446
So, can you guys go and get it?

960
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:56,377
Us?

961
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,111
You're telling us to go in?

962
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:59,533
Why?

963
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:00,763
You don't want to?

964
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,608
That wedding dress is super expensive.

965
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:08,829
Every stitch was made by hand
by a very famous designer.

966
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:10,950
Okay. Fine. Who said we didn't want to?

967
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,603
We just need to go get it for you.

968
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:16,070
What are you saying? There are creditors
everywhere. How do you want us to get in?

969
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:19,298
We just need to climb the wall.
Just climb the wall.

970
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:20,966
We don't have time for that.

971
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:22,794
They you can stay here, you coward!

972
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,680
Us men will go.

973
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:25,596
Kibong,

974
00:41:25,885 --> 00:41:27,103
-let's go.
-Okay.

975
00:41:30,506 --> 00:41:32,933
-Where did he go?
-Who knows?

976
00:41:34,697 --> 00:41:36,855
-CEO Han?
-He must be inside.

977
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:39,121
We don't have time for this.

978
00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:41,218
This is driving me crazy.

979
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,805
CEO Han!

980
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:46,042
The sky is so blue.

981
00:41:56,728 --> 00:41:58,348
-Show your manliness.
-Huh?

982
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:00,140
-No way.
-Start climbing already.

983
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,211
I'm scared.

984
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,482
Darn it.

985
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:21,446
Phew...

986
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:22,978
Jungi.

987
00:42:24,314 --> 00:42:25,988
Come up quickly. What are you doing?

988
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:29,601
-Hurry up. Climb.
-Okay, I'm coming.

989
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:31,276
How do I go up?

990
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:32,634
What are you doing?

991
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:34,357
You're amazing.

992
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:36,386
You're not even Spiderman or anything.

993
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:38,276
Geez, you're just tall for nothing.

994
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,527
-Jungi.
-Are you playing around right now?

995
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:44,616
-I can't do it anymore.
-Hurry.

996
00:42:44,704 --> 00:42:45,617
Hurry up.

997
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:48,245
I think I'm done. Go first. Jungi.

998
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:49,866
Jungi. Ow.

999
00:42:49,954 --> 00:42:51,017
Jungi.

1000
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,830
Are you a tuna or halibut or what?

1001
00:42:59,814 --> 00:43:01,626
Gosh, I thought I'd die.

1002
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:02,905
Do we have to go this far?

1003
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:03,915
What else can we do?

1004
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:07,333
We got a 5 million dress from Suyeon.
We should at least do this much for her.

1005
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:09,757
-Let's just get her phone, then leave.
-Okay.

1006
00:43:12,354 --> 00:43:14,461
Is this a house or a palace?

1007
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:16,824
Her family is really rich.

1008
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,527
-Let's find her room first.
-Okay.

1009
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:25,155
Hurry up.

1010
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:35,285
Jungi. Jungi.

1011
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:37,226
-I think this is Suyeon's room.
-Really?

1012
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:45,835
This is right. That's her.

1013
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:47,103
How pretty.

1014
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:48,837
Right, her dressing table.

1015
00:43:50,535 --> 00:43:51,605
Here it is.

1016
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,273
Look in the drawer.

1017
00:44:00,394 --> 00:44:01,276
I found it.

1018
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:02,215
Let's get out.

1019
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:05,965
Where is CEO Han?

1020
00:44:06,054 --> 00:44:06,893
CEO Han!

1021
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:07,761
Come out this instant!

1022
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,788
-CEO Han, where are you?!
-Come out!

1023
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:17,700
Don't come out right now.

1024
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,249
If you do, you're dead.

1025
00:44:23,934 --> 00:44:25,192
Who are those people?

1026
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:26,545
Are they the creditors?

1027
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:27,898
What do we do?

1028
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:29,786
This is driving me crazy.

1029
00:44:29,874 --> 00:44:30,793
Just take a look around,

1030
00:44:30,882 --> 00:44:33,822
and take what looks valuable.

1031
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,952
This one, for example. That too.

1032
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,115
Take them all out.

1033
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,408
You can just take out
what's in the rooms, as well.

1034
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,285
Sir, the door is locked.

1035
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:47,525
Well, then...

1036
00:44:47,614 --> 00:44:48,640
Break it down.

1037
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,492
-Break?
-They're going to break it through?

1038
00:44:54,018 --> 00:44:55,215
What do we do?

1039
00:45:05,014 --> 00:45:07,442
-Sir, we opened it.
-Yes. Sure.

1040
00:45:07,731 --> 00:45:10,270
Look at that. There's a lot in here.

1041
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,049
Take this. Take all the
good things and leave.

1042
00:45:14,138 --> 00:45:17,282
This dressing table,
the bed, and the closet.

1043
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:20,153
Wait a second. What's in the closet?

1044
00:45:24,207 --> 00:45:26,731
Look. It all looks expensive.

1045
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,059
They can worth quite a bit.

1046
00:45:28,148 --> 00:45:30,411
Just take out the whole closet.

1047
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,373
Alright.

1048
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:33,927
-Please take care of it all.
-Yes, sir.

1049
00:45:34,016 --> 00:45:36,876
Over there, and things like that.

1050
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:40,467
We're doomed. It's moving.

1051
00:45:41,254 --> 00:45:42,945
Why aren't they coming out?

1052
00:45:43,966 --> 00:45:45,010
Look at that.

1053
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:48,175
That's my dressing table.

1054
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,717
That's my closet.

1055
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:50,897
Place that here.

1056
00:45:50,986 --> 00:45:51,854
That one too.

1057
00:45:51,943 --> 00:45:52,891
Move it a bit.

1058
00:45:54,186 --> 00:45:55,055
It's so hot.

1059
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:58,389
What do we do?

1060
00:46:03,654 --> 00:46:05,336
Let's move it. One, two.

1061
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:07,191
What are they doing?

1062
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,138
It's Jungi.

1063
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,101
What happened? Why aren't you here?

1064
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,033
Wooshik, we're in trouble.

1065
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:16,326
We're stuck right now.

1066
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:18,046
Stuck where?

1067
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:20,623
We're in Suyeon's closet.

1068
00:46:23,154 --> 00:46:24,912
Closet? What are you talking about...?

1069
00:46:25,624 --> 00:46:27,629
-Here we go.
-Slowly.

1070
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,103
Are you talking about a pink closet?

1071
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:30,316
How did you know?

1072
00:46:30,404 --> 00:46:33,484
You guys are being
loaded on a truck right now.

1073
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:35,914
What? It's moving.

1074
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,315
Wooshik, Wooshik.

1075
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,257
Save us.

1076
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:41,942
We'll die.

1077
00:46:44,294 --> 00:46:45,821
You fools.

1078
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:48,286
What's wrong? What happened?

1079
00:46:48,374 --> 00:46:49,429
I don't know, either.

1080
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:51,575
This is driving me nuts.

1081
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:58,840
Is it so hard to give me salary advance?

1082
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:00,033
They're so mean.

1083
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:02,417
Where did they all go?

1084
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:06,908
Why would she just leave
her clothes there?

1085
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:17,672
It's so pretty.

1086
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:21,334
I think it suits me well.

1087
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:25,149
I want to get married too.

1088
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:32,195
What if I spend my whole life single?

1089
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,571
Whatever. I should take it off.

1090
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,551
It would be embarrassing
if they caught me in this.

1091
00:47:39,261 --> 00:47:40,001
Ouch, my hair.

1092
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:42,945
This is driving me crazy.

1093
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:47,565
What the...

1094
00:47:47,654 --> 00:47:49,345
It's completely stuck.

1095
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:50,939
What do I do?

1096
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:52,256
Whatever.

1097
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,357
I'll just cut it off.

1098
00:47:53,446 --> 00:47:54,820
Scissors. Where are the scissors?

1099
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:55,855
Scissors.

1100
00:47:56,397 --> 00:47:57,365
Scissors.

1101
00:47:58,124 --> 00:47:58,976
Scissors.

1102
00:48:02,872 --> 00:48:04,801
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

1103
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,646
Whatever. Scissors.

1104
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:09,711
Scissors. Scissors.

1105
00:48:12,363 --> 00:48:14,497
What is now?

1106
00:48:19,614 --> 00:48:20,784
Why can't it get out?

1107
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:24,356
Excuse me? Is anyone there?

1108
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,853
Hello?

1109
00:48:25,942 --> 00:48:27,514
Is anyone there?

1110
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:31,872
What do we do now?

1111
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:32,992
This is driving me crazy.

1112
00:48:33,654 --> 00:48:35,326
Let's move it after a smoke.

1113
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:36,302
Yes, sir.

1114
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:39,016
They're leaving. Okay, we're good.

1115
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:50,196
Jungi, Kibong, are you okay?

1116
00:48:50,957 --> 00:48:54,066
Wooshik. Take us out.

1117
00:48:54,154 --> 00:48:55,039
Just give me a second.

1118
00:49:03,822 --> 00:49:05,076
-Wooshik.
-Shut up.

1119
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:06,206
We have no time, hurry up.

1120
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:07,529
Yes, yes, we're here. We're going up.

1121
00:49:07,618 --> 00:49:08,680
Darn it.

1122
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:14,359
Geez. He's so impatient.

1123
00:49:14,448 --> 00:49:15,894
What are you doing?

1124
00:49:15,983 --> 00:49:17,207
How did the straps came off?

1125
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:18,596
That would've been bad.

1126
00:49:18,684 --> 00:49:20,666
Anyway, let's move this closet first.

1127
00:49:20,754 --> 00:49:21,703
-Yes, sir.
-Go up.

1128
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,625
Help us, hurry up.

1129
00:49:24,324 --> 00:49:25,736
-On three.
-Be careful.

1130
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:26,703
No. No.

1131
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:28,177
No, they can't do that.

1132
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:35,881
Have a safe ride back.

1133
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:37,246
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1134
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:39,225
I fell asleep.

1135
00:49:39,604 --> 00:49:41,376
-You're back?
-Yeah.

1136
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:43,016
Gosh.

1137
00:49:43,465 --> 00:49:44,497
What's all of this?

1138
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:48,010
We went to CEO Han's house and
I got all the valuable items.

1139
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:49,277
That's nice.

1140
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:54,515
This closet's so pretty.

1141
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:57,018
It's all pink. Just the way I like it.

1142
00:50:07,072 --> 00:50:08,002
Honey,

1143
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,777
what's inside all of this?

1144
00:50:10,865 --> 00:50:13,892
What do you mean? It's all for you.

1145
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:15,279
These?

1146
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:17,315
Yeah, I told you so.

1147
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:19,476
Just choose what you want.

1148
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:21,607
I like this one.

1149
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:23,545
Are you crazy?

1150
00:50:25,497 --> 00:50:26,488
Who are you?

1151
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:27,509
Why are you here?

1152
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:29,777
Well. So what happened is...

1153
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:32,754
Who are you, people? Why are you here?

1154
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:34,673
Yes, about that.

1155
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,740
Professor Cha, we finally succeeded.

1156
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:46,076
Professor Kook, we finally did it.

1157
00:50:46,165 --> 00:50:47,242
Success?

1158
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:49,892
-What are you saying?
-Let us introduce ourselves.

1159
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:52,414
Nice to meet you.

1160
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:54,299
Nice to meet you, too.

1161
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,203
We are from America's NASA.

1162
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:00,610
We are researchers who are secretly...

1163
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,217
...studying teleportation.

1164
00:51:03,136 --> 00:51:04,871
-Teleportation?
-Yes.

1165
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:06,504
After long and arduous experiments,

1166
00:51:06,593 --> 00:51:09,519
we have finally succeeded
in teleporting ourselves here.

1167
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,408
You teleported?

1168
00:51:11,592 --> 00:51:13,596
Into this closet?

1169
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:14,803
As you can see.

1170
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,252
There's nothing that can be done.
I'll have to show you proof.

1171
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:26,008
This is the teleportation device.

1172
00:51:27,325 --> 00:51:31,288
If we use this,
we will teleport into another closet.

1173
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:32,481
Alright.

1174
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:34,053
Close your eyes.

1175
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:34,977
Why?

1176
00:51:35,065 --> 00:51:39,812
The extreme light from this device
can destroy your optic nerves.

1177
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:43,059
If you want to lose your eyesight forever,
you can keep your eyes open.

1178
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,523
-My eyesight?
-Well, then.

1179
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:50,873
Alright.

1180
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:53,127
I'll start it now.

1181
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,207
Honey.

1182
00:51:54,295 --> 00:51:56,172
I will count to three.

1183
00:51:58,025 --> 00:51:59,034
One.

1184
00:51:59,664 --> 00:52:00,503
Honey.

1185
00:52:00,682 --> 00:52:02,856
Close your eyes for now.

1186
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:03,896
Two.

1187
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:06,672
We're from NASA.

1188
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:07,801
NASA.

1189
00:52:08,457 --> 00:52:09,317
Three.

1190
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:16,752
What happened?

1191
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:18,653
Did they teleport?

1192
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:20,115
Oh, well...

1193
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,015
You punks.

1194
00:52:24,355 --> 00:52:25,940
I knew you'd do this.

1195
00:52:26,907 --> 00:52:29,485
You guys work for CEO Han, don't you?

1196
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:31,717
Suyeon! Start the car!

1197
00:52:31,805 --> 00:52:34,066
-Hurry up.
-Okay. Alright.

1198
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:35,437
You jerks.

1199
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:36,577
Stop where you are.

1200
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,801
You're dead if I catch you.

1201
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,758
I thought I'd die.

1202
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:43,728
Me, too.

1203
00:52:43,908 --> 00:52:45,839
I was so scared to death.

1204
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:47,394
I told you not to go in.

1205
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:48,447
Look at yourself.

1206
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:50,591
-It was going well before they...
-Shut up!

1207
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,688
Anyway...

1208
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,427
...this is all because of Han Suyeon.

1209
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:57,356
Still, she's our first love.

1210
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:00,069
Hello? Secretary Kim?

1211
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:02,756
Do you know where my dad is?

1212
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,517
He's with me right now.

1213
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:08,997
-Suyeon.
-Dad.

1214
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,496
Suyeon, where are you?

1215
00:53:10,716 --> 00:53:11,563
Are you okay?

1216
00:53:11,782 --> 00:53:13,736
Yeah, I'm okay. How about you?

1217
00:53:13,825 --> 00:53:15,000
I'm okay, too.

1218
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,464
I'm really sorry, Suyeon.

1219
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:18,667
Because of me...

1220
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,428
No, it's fine.

1221
00:53:20,517 --> 00:53:22,559
But, what happened?

1222
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:26,017
I think I was scammed.

1223
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:28,917
I'll figure it all out and call you back.

1224
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:30,344
Just hang in there.

1225
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:32,377
-Understand?
-What are you saying?

1226
00:53:32,466 --> 00:53:34,324
I can't talk for long,

1227
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:35,507
so I'll call you later.

1228
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:36,444
Dad.

1229
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:37,862
Dad.

1230
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:44,326
Suyeon,

1231
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:45,432
what's wrong?

1232
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:47,387
What did your dad say?

1233
00:53:58,011 --> 00:53:59,102
I think this is the place.

1234
00:53:59,762 --> 00:54:01,990
Is this your husband's house?

1235
00:54:02,236 --> 00:54:02,921
Yeah.

1236
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:05,310
But, I don't think the creditors are here.

1237
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:06,434
I guess you're right.

1238
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,711
By the way,

1239
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,698
didn't you say you couldn't
reach your husband?

1240
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:11,135
What are you going to do?

1241
00:54:11,908 --> 00:54:13,732
I'm going to wait until he comes.

1242
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,350
Anyway, thanks for everything you've done.

1243
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:21,010
I'll make it up to you guys one day.

1244
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:22,968
Don't mention it.

1245
00:54:24,568 --> 00:54:25,747
Goodbye, Suyeon.

1246
00:54:26,356 --> 00:54:28,052
If something happens, let us know.

1247
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:29,459
-He's right.
-I will.

1248
00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:30,875
Get home safely, guys.

1249
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:32,277
Yeah, goodbye.

1250
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,459
Is she going to be okay?

1251
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:42,563
Should you be worrying
about someone else right now?

1252
00:54:42,686 --> 00:54:44,040
Let's go and earn some money.

1253
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:45,393
Yeah, let's go.

1254
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:47,190
Hold on, hold on.

1255
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:50,872
-That place has really great...
-Yeah.

1256
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:53,420
Suyeon.

1257
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,572
Minseok...

1258
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,877
Isn't that the groom?

1259
00:54:58,265 --> 00:54:59,098
That's right.

1260
00:54:59,975 --> 00:55:02,651
What happened?
Why couldn't I get in touch with you?

1261
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,727
Well...

1262
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:04,979
The thing is...

1263
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:11,647
I'm sorry.
You must've worried so much, Mother.

1264
00:55:11,736 --> 00:55:14,096
Who are you calling Mother?

1265
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:18,489
-Excuse me?
-Do you know how much my family,

1266
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:19,759
was humiliated because of you?

1267
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:21,899
What's going on?

1268
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:23,571
What is it?

1269
00:55:24,442 --> 00:55:27,309
There's no need to drag things out.

1270
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:28,585
Let's just pretend...

1271
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:30,620
...this wedding never happened.

1272
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:32,831
What...

1273
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,926
What are you talking about?

1274
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:38,099
Are you clueless or just dumb?

1275
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,310
Dis you think we approved of
this marriage because we liked you?

1276
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:43,953
It was because of your father's wealth.

1277
00:55:46,751 --> 00:55:50,473
So, you should understand your
situation and not come here again.

1278
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:51,783
Don't contact us either.

1279
00:55:52,486 --> 00:55:54,435
You have no shame.

1280
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:01,810
That lady was too harsh.

1281
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:07,069
Minseok.

1282
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:13,464
I'm sorry.

1283
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:15,630
There's nothing I can do about it.

1284
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:36,933
That piece of trash.

1285
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:38,560
How can a man like that exist?

1286
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:41,090
I know right.
I ought to just kill those people...

1287
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:42,788
-Let's just go.
-Where are you going?

1288
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:44,255
-We're going home.
-Wooshik!

1289
00:56:44,344 --> 00:56:46,331
Don't go, let's go home.

1290
00:56:50,649 --> 00:56:51,512
Get up.

1291
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,866
Hurry and get up. Let's go.

1292
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:57,356
Go where?

1293
00:56:58,495 --> 00:57:00,083
I have nowhere to go.

1294
00:57:00,172 --> 00:57:01,006
Why?

1295
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,135
Are you going to get
on your knees and beg them?

1296
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,714
Are you not even angry
after hearing all of that?

1297
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:06,884
I am.

1298
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:09,648
I'm angry and it feels so unfair.

1299
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:12,881
But, what can I do?

1300
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:18,829
What can I do in my state right now?

1301
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:21,816
Nothing's going to change
by you doing this.

1302
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,637
So, just follow me.

1303
00:57:24,795 --> 00:57:26,387
I'm not going.

1304
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,154
I said I'm not going.

1305
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,508
All of my stuff are in there.

1306
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,255
Who is it?

1307
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:51,513
Geez.

1308
00:57:56,028 --> 00:57:58,150
We're here to get Suyeon's belongings.

1309
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,456
Belongings?

1310
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:02,452
Suyeon, who are these people?

1311
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:05,286
That's none of your business.

1312
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:07,860
Would you please get out the way.

1313
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:10,121
Who are you to be doing this?

1314
00:58:10,164 --> 00:58:11,035
Us?

1315
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,064
We're Suyeon's first loves.

1316
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:13,941
What about it?

1317
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:15,061
First love?

1318
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:17,501
All of these people
are your first loves?

1319
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:18,315
All three of them?

1320
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:19,826
No.

1321
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,133
Suyeon is our first love.

1322
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,011
I'm Number One.

1323
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,087
I'm Number Two.

1324
00:58:31,419 --> 00:58:32,409
I'm Number Three.

1325
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:33,869
Got it?

1326
00:58:34,258 --> 00:58:35,205
What are you doing?

1327
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:36,353
Go get her stuffs.

1328
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:38,051
Let's go.

1329
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,118
-You people.
-Move.

1330
00:58:40,207 --> 00:58:42,319
Hey you...!
Suyeon...

1331
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:44,753
Excuse me. Where...

1332
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:00,805
What do you think...

1333
00:59:00,894 --> 00:59:02,584
...you people are doing right now?

1334
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:03,869
Can't you tell?

1335
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,226
We're getting Suyeon's stuffs.

1336
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:06,029
What did you say?

1337
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:07,889
You wanted to pretend like
the wedding never happened.

1338
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,012
So, we set things straight.

1339
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:12,969
You have no shame.

1340
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:13,940
What...?

1341
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,601
You people,
you're getting more out of hand.

1342
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,697
So what are you going to do?

1343
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,509
What?

1344
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:23,209
Suyeon, you got all your things, right?

1345
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:24,730
-Did you leave anything behind?
-Huh?

1346
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:28,353
There's one more thing.

1347
00:59:28,442 --> 00:59:29,292
What is it?

1348
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:35,805
What?

1349
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:37,013
The suit?

1350
00:59:39,468 --> 00:59:41,484
Did you buy that for him?

1351
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:45,171
What?

1352
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:47,526
Are you clueless or just dumb?

1353
00:59:47,615 --> 00:59:49,334
Take off your suit.

1354
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:50,411
What did you say?

1355
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:53,098
Geez, you have really bad hearing.

1356
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:56,360
Take it off while we're being nice.

1357
00:59:58,109 --> 00:59:59,151
Hurry up.

1358
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:11,257
Here you go.

1359
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:13,800
Geez, you must be dumb.

1360
01:00:13,889 --> 01:00:15,041
What is a suit, guys?

1361
01:00:15,129 --> 01:00:16,951
-It's a set.
-It's a set.

1362
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,681
-What do you mean?
-Take off your pants too.

1363
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:21,194
-Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

1364
01:00:26,853 --> 01:00:27,690
Suyeon...

1365
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:29,731
...are you really going to do this to me?

1366
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,983
I'm sorry.

1367
01:00:32,808 --> 01:00:34,407
There's nothing I can do about it.

1368
01:00:40,028 --> 01:00:42,020
-Take it off.
-Take it off.

1369
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:47,220
Suyeon, look around.

1370
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:48,811
We didn't leave anything behind, right?

1371
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:49,865
No.

1372
01:00:51,134 --> 01:00:51,983
Oh, right.

1373
01:00:52,072 --> 01:00:52,922
Minky.

1374
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:54,611
I forgot about Minky.

1375
01:00:54,699 --> 01:00:56,241
-Minky?
-Is there more?

1376
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:57,235
Minky?

1377
01:00:57,493 --> 01:00:58,476
What's that?

1378
01:01:01,827 --> 01:01:02,786
Minky...

1379
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,396
...is an iguana?

1380
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:05,337
Yeah.

1381
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:08,035
I've had him since I was young.
He's family to me.

1382
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:10,033
I see.

1383
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,576
But, Suyeon, what's your plan?

1384
01:01:12,796 --> 01:01:14,939
Should we drop you off
at your relatives' house?

1385
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:15,967
My relatives?

1386
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,161
It's been a long time since we've
lost contact because of money issues.

1387
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:22,432
Is there anywhere you can go to?

1388
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,537
I should start looking for that now.

1389
01:01:24,832 --> 01:01:25,674
Really?

1390
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:27,906
You have to look?

1391
01:01:29,266 --> 01:01:32,632
You can just stay at our guesthouse.

1392
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,841
Right, Wooshik?

1393
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:34,887
He's right.

1394
01:01:34,976 --> 01:01:37,144
We have a lot of empty rooms
and no guests.

1395
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:39,537
Really?

1396
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,001
Can I really stay?

1397
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:41,924
Of course.

1398
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:44,827
It's okay, right, Wooshik?

1399
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:46,397
Well...

1400
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:48,028
...If she wants to.

1401
01:01:48,149 --> 01:01:49,015
Really?

1402
01:01:50,364 --> 01:01:51,754
Thank you so much.

1403
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:53,834
I'll make it up to you guys one day.

1404
01:01:53,923 --> 01:01:55,456
Don't be too happy about it yet.

1405
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,281
We don't know when we'll be kicked out.

1406
01:01:57,369 --> 01:01:59,451
It's fine. It's fine.

1407
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:01,318
We have Suyeon's wedding dress.

1408
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,500
We can sell that and pay
the landlady 5 million won.

1409
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:04,773
She'll cut us some slack.

1410
01:02:13,092 --> 01:02:14,484
-Jungi.
-Yes?

1411
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,973
Suyeon, be careful.

1412
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:20,388
Here we go.

1413
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:22,021
Be careful with your hands.

1414
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:22,960
Be careful.

1415
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,093
Thanks so much, guys.

1416
01:02:26,182 --> 01:02:28,381
I really will make it up to you guys...!

1417
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:31,390
Why? What's wrong? What is it?

1418
01:02:31,479 --> 01:02:32,265
Over there...

1419
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,224
It's Jeongeun.

1420
01:02:40,685 --> 01:02:41,608
Kim Jeongeun.

1421
01:02:41,777 --> 01:02:43,706
What are you doing here?
Why are you sleeping here?

1422
01:02:44,864 --> 01:02:45,958
Kim Jeongeun!

1423
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:49,891
Jungi.

1424
01:02:49,979 --> 01:02:51,752
Why are you here like this?

1425
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:53,774
Wait a second.

1426
01:02:53,995 --> 01:02:55,638
Isn't this Suyeon's wedding dress?

1427
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,157
Well, what happened was...

1428
01:02:58,246 --> 01:03:00,821
It was in the living room,
so I tried it on.

1429
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:02,376
It's not even yours.
Why would you wear it?

1430
01:03:02,465 --> 01:03:03,705
Do you know how expensive...

1431
01:03:05,479 --> 01:03:06,281
Hold on.

1432
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,888
Why is the dress stuck there?

1433
01:03:17,134 --> 01:03:18,256
This. This.

1434
01:03:18,345 --> 01:03:19,500
Why is it ripped?

1435
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:20,876
What happened?

1436
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,040
What happened to this?

1437
01:03:23,129 --> 01:03:24,851
I tried to take it off,

1438
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:27,135
but then my hair got stuck.

1439
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:28,497
If you were going to take it off,
you should've done it properly.

1440
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:29,838
You fool!

1441
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:31,377
We're all doomed.

1442
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:33,818
We're doomed and it's all you fault!

1443
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:35,116
My 5 million won.

1444
01:03:35,465 --> 01:03:37,440
My 5 million won is all gone.

1445
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:39,248
Mr. Cha!

1446
01:03:41,689 --> 01:03:43,877
The landlady is here. What should we do?

1447
01:03:43,966 --> 01:03:45,213
Let's go down. Quickly.

1448
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:47,451
Where are you going?

1449
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:49,651
Get me out first.

1450
01:03:51,418 --> 01:03:53,045
Where did they all go?

1451
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:54,395
Oh my god!

1452
01:03:54,609 --> 01:03:55,860
What's that?

1453
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:57,009
Ma'am!

1454
01:03:58,986 --> 01:04:00,440
Ma'am, you've arrived?

1455
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:01,610
Wooshik.

1456
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,023
No. I mean...

1457
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:04,410
...Mr. Cha.

1458
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:07,057
Did you prepare the money you promised?

1459
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:07,903
Pardon?

1460
01:04:07,992 --> 01:04:09,177
Well...

1461
01:04:09,506 --> 01:04:10,331
In knew it.

1462
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:11,631
You don't have the money.

1463
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:13,464
Well, there's nothing we can do.

1464
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,514
-You may get started.
-Yes, ma'am.

1465
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:16,723
What? Start what? Why?

1466
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:17,837
Why, why, why?

1467
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:22,309
Ma'am, please forgive us just this once.

1468
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:25,824
Please just wait one more week.

1469
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:27,316
Ma'am.

1470
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,656
I beg you. Please give us one chance.

1471
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:30,597
Let me go.

1472
01:04:30,686 --> 01:04:32,157
-We can't.
-I can't let it slide any longer.

1473
01:04:32,249 --> 01:04:33,446
Let me go!

1474
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,160
You guys are overreacting.

1475
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,248
Excuse me.

1476
01:04:39,337 --> 01:04:41,408
You said you just needed
the money by today, right?

1477
01:04:42,273 --> 01:04:43,293
Yes, why do you ask?

1478
01:04:43,873 --> 01:04:46,121
Guys, how much rent do you owe?

1479
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:47,165
Well...

1480
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:49,148
...with everything combined...

1481
01:04:49,373 --> 01:04:50,668
...about 10 million won.

1482
01:04:50,757 --> 01:04:51,601
Really?

1483
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:56,718
Guys...

1484
01:04:57,718 --> 01:04:58,823
...go get Minky.

1485
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:00,955
Here you go.

1486
01:05:04,198 --> 01:05:05,982
The iguana is worth 10 million won?

1487
01:05:06,071 --> 01:05:08,412
Minky is a really special
breed of the iguana.

1488
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:09,753
He's really rare.

1489
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:11,246
I see.

1490
01:05:11,443 --> 01:05:12,766
Will you be okay?

1491
01:05:13,558 --> 01:05:15,048
There's nothing I can do.

1492
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:17,688
Minky...

1493
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:21,354
...I'll come back one day to get you.

1494
01:05:21,939 --> 01:05:23,705
Make sure to eat, okay?

1495
01:05:30,578 --> 01:05:32,445
Now that we got the
money for the landlady,

1496
01:05:32,534 --> 01:05:34,780
the world seems so beautiful.

1497
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:36,828
-Right?
-Yeah.

1498
01:05:37,277 --> 01:05:40,161
I really thought we'd be
kicked out this time.

1499
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,549
-Right, Wooshik?
-What?

1500
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:43,020
Yeah.

1501
01:05:43,668 --> 01:05:45,592
Anyway, you saved us today.

1502
01:05:46,468 --> 01:05:47,320
Thank you.

1503
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:48,681
Don't be.

1504
01:05:48,938 --> 01:05:50,802
I told you I'd make it up to you guys.

1505
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,072
Those kids remind me of our old days.

1506
01:05:57,236 --> 01:05:58,100
Right?

1507
01:05:58,701 --> 01:05:59,834
You're right.

1508
01:06:00,154 --> 01:06:02,376
We were always together
like that back in the day.

1509
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:03,522
Do you remember, Suyeon?

1510
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:04,642
Of course.

1511
01:06:04,731 --> 01:06:06,300
Those were the good days.

1512
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,403
Put honey in it.

1513
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:09,943
Oh, right.

1514
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:13,721
I'm curious about something.

1515
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:14,660
What is it?

1516
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:19,121
Am I really your guys' first love?

1517
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,046
For all of you three?

1518
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:23,791
It's cold tonight.

1519
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,206
It's cold. I'll have to run.

1520
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:27,881
-I'm tired now that the rent is paid.
-What's going on?

1521
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:29,585
-Why are you changing the subject?
-What's wrong?

1522
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:31,551
Am I not your first love? Huh?

1523
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:32,607
Tell me. Tell me.

1524
01:06:33,105 --> 01:06:34,000
Tell me. Tell me.

1525
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:35,680
It's so cold. Let's just run.

1526
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:36,849
-Should we?
-Okay.

1527
01:06:36,938 --> 01:06:37,991
-Alright.
-Why are you running?

1528
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:39,480
Let's go.

1529
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:42,556
Where are you going?

1530
01:06:43,607 --> 01:06:44,803
Get back here!

1531
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:46,054
Wait for me!

1532
01:06:46,498 --> 01:06:47,907
-Let it go.
-This is mine.

1533
01:06:48,012 --> 01:06:49,460
Why did you take it all?

1534
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:51,081
-Stop it.
-Look at him.

1535
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,012
Stop it!

1536
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:10,831
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1537
01:07:10,919 --> 01:07:12,461
Why do we have no guests?

1538
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,326
We need to promote.
It's best to do it with a TV appearance.

1539
01:07:15,415 --> 01:07:17,291
Kibong, the producer from
the broadcasting station came.

1540
01:07:17,379 --> 01:07:20,021
Is it true that you never feel the cold?

1541
01:07:20,109 --> 01:07:21,543
You want me to go in there?

1542
01:07:22,629 --> 01:07:25,251
Why is this here?
It shouldn't be here. Right?

1543
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:27,031
Hurry and leave.

1544
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,261
How do I look?
Do I look like a successful career woman?

1545
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,321
I'm going to get a job.

1546
01:07:30,409 --> 01:07:31,497
Inside the bear?

1547
01:07:33,085 --> 01:07:34,551
How is it that you
always get into trouble?

1548
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:36,236
Should you be saying that
to an injured person right now?

1549
01:07:36,325 --> 01:07:37,801
You'll work at a promotional event?

1550
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:39,721
Jeongeun can't be fired because of me.

1551
01:07:39,809 --> 01:07:41,501
Suyeon might be fired because of me.

1552
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:43,261
Two free ones.

1553
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:44,641
That one. That one.

1554
01:07:45,215 --> 01:07:49,007
Excuse me. The angel and
the flower are fighting.

1555
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,261
What is it now?

1556
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:52,641
You suffered so much because of me today.
