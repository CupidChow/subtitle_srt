1
00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:01,101
What?

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,904
Who did you say?

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,006
What?

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,108
-That startled me!
-Oh my!

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,384
Wooshik, what's wrong? Who was it?

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,311
My...

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,313
My sister is coming.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,083
What?!

9
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,312
Your sister is coming?

10
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:19,172
For real? Yuri?

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,079
Yes, she is. Guys,
go and lock the front gate right now.

12
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:23,657
-Hurry up!
-Yes! Yes!

13
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,295
Hi!

14
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:31,398
How have you been, slacker?

15
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:34,268
You're still slacking as usual.

16
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:40,468
This bear's head has gotten bigger.
How much bigger will it get?

17
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:42,876
Soon, you can start
floating around by yourself.

18
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:47,047
Oh my, just look at that!

19
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,082
It's been a while.

20
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,386
You've become manlier
since I last saw you.

21
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,273
Oh my dear...

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,859
Oh my...

23
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,160
We're stranger, aren't we?

24
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:02,062
Yes.

25
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:03,970
Sorry.

26
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:04,965
Sorry.

27
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:11,138
Oh my, my cute brother. How have you...

28
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,152
Enough. Why are you here?

29
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:14,562
What do you mean by that?

30
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:17,177
I'm here to see you of course.

31
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,271
Right. I enjoyed the show!
Huam-dong's Goat Man.

32
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:22,049
Whatever. Now that you've seen
me, you can leave.

33
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,386
Hurry up and leave.
I'm tired of cleaning up after your mess,

34
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:27,855
hurry up and leave now!

35
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,777
You're too much.

36
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,064
How could you do this to me?

37
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,730
I worked so hard to raise
you without our mother.

38
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:41,735
When you had a high
fever, I carried you...

39
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,864
...on a heavy winter,
and climbed over three mountains.

40
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:49,055
I crossed over that frozen stream barefoot
and brought you to the health center.

41
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,444
We don't have any mountain
in our neighborhood.

42
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,447
And we have a General Hospital near our
house. Such crap about health center.

43
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,149
Sure. You don't have to believe
me if you don't want to.

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,051
I can't do anything about it.

45
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,253
If you tell me to leave,

46
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,255
I'll leave.

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,161
Take care of yourself, everyone.

48
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:11,556
I'll leave now.

49
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,572
Throw some salts.

50
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,845
Wooshik.

51
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,958
I'll go now.

52
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:29,750
Don't get sick.

53
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,252
Eat well.

54
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:33,453
And...

55
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,756
-Take care, Wooshik.
-Okay, bye.

56
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,743
Darn it, he's not falling for it.

57
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:48,675
He's become smarter since
the last time I saw him.

58
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,155
Fine, brother.

59
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:54,007
So, you're going to be like this?

60
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,810
Let's see who will win.

61
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,456
-Did she leave?
-Yes.

62
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,958
But aren't you being a
bit harsh on your sister?

63
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,760
She was even crying.

64
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,821
Those were all acts.

65
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,832
Besides breathing, all she does is lying.

66
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,134
Do you know how many times
I've been tricked by her?

67
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:24,014
That's right. She bullied us
so much when we were young.

68
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:26,540
I get shivers just by thinking of it.

69
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:28,930
That's right. She's a dangerous being.

70
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:31,344
Anyway, it's an emergency situation now.

71
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,448
Don't put your guards down,
and never answer her calls!

72
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,242
Don't talk to her,
don't even look at her.

73
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:40,048
If I catch you talking to her,
I'll kick you out right away.

74
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:41,356
-Of course!
-For sure!

75
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:43,256
Don't worry, my friend.

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,693
Be careful!
Make sure you remember her face!

77
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:57,204
Why is she suddenly here anyway?

78
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,473
Was I too harsh on her?

79
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:03,877
Whatever. If she really doesn't have
anywhere to go, she'll go to dad.

80
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,260
That's strange.

81
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,963
All she did was put ointment on me.

82
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,865
Why was my heart pounding so much?

83
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,600
Is it maybe?

84
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:29,303
Do I have a heart disease?

85
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,816
No way. The checkup said I was fine.

86
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:33,206
It's strange.

87
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,275
What's wrong?
Why are you mumbling by yourself?

88
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,859
No, it's nothing.

89
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,076
What then?

90
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:41,448
By the way, Jungi.

91
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,466
A woman made a very ordinary move,

92
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:47,172
but your heart suddenly starts pounding,

93
00:04:47,256 --> 00:04:49,189
and you feel excited.
What would the reason be?

94
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,167
Your heart started pounding?

95
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:52,252
Yes.

96
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,367
Your heart?

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,454
But since your nipple is there,
your heart must be lower.

98
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,799
Do you want to die? Stop saying
nonsense and just answer the question.

99
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,101
Why do you even ask?
Of course it's because you like her.

100
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:03,003
What? It's because I like her?

101
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,605
Of course! If not,
why would your heart be pounding at all.

102
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,899
Why? Do you have a woman that you like?

103
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,302
No, it's not me but my friend.

104
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:13,513
Your friend?

105
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,081
You don't have other friends besides
us because of your nasty personality.

106
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,555
I do so! Who do you take me for?

107
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,785
This jerk!

108
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,381
See! That's what I'm talking about.

109
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:24,858
That's why you don't have friends!

110
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,149
So cold! Why is it so chilly?

111
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,068
What's that?

112
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:49,349
Yuri!

113
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:50,817
Why are you there?

114
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:52,317
You didn't go back home?

115
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:54,187
Hi Kibong.

116
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,291
Well, actually...

117
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,303
I didn't have any place to go.

118
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:03,517
-What do you mean by that?
-The thing is...

119
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:08,683
I was kicked out because the friend I
lived with ran away with the deposit.

120
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:10,389
So that's what happened.

121
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:13,073
Oh right! Wooshik said
not to ever talk with you!

122
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,175
I see.

123
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:16,476
Well...

124
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,912
I did a lot of things to him before.

125
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,292
It's understandable.

126
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,615
But Kibong,

127
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,302
do you know the feeling?

128
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:26,519
Like the feeling of being left alone...

129
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,423
...in this whole universe.

130
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,126
Like the feeling of...

131
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:37,330
...working so hard to throw
baseball in minor league,

132
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,033
but no one recognizes you effort.

133
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,836
If only someone said, "Kibong, cheer up!"

134
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:44,337
"Kibong, you can do it!"

135
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,439
Just those words.

136
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,844
If you hear it,
you can hold on and get up again.

137
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,049
But no one is by your side.

138
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:55,532
Besides those who call you
"loser" or "useless punk",

139
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,751
and those who blame you.

140
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,153
I'm talking about that lonely feeling.

141
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,123
I understand that feeling.

142
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,626
I understand it better than anyone else.

143
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,732
-It has been hard on you, hasn't it?
-Yes.

144
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:16,036
From now on, I will cheer for you.

145
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,437
Kibong, cheer up!

146
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,308
-Kook Kibong, you can do it!
-Yuri!

147
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:24,911
I also want someone to grab my hand...

148
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,112
No, even if it's just...

149
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:29,683
...holding this one tiny finger,

150
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,485
I could get back up again.

151
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,958
I'll hold it for you.

152
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:39,859
Kibong...

153
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,963
I'll be on your side.

154
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,864
Even if Wooshik ignores you,

155
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,068
-I won't ever ignore you.
-Kibong!

156
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,170
Yuri!

157
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:55,949
Cha Wooshik, you mean jerk!

158
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,146
That means, I really like Suyeon?

159
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,948
That's impossible.

160
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:05,051
But why was my heart pounding?

161
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,954
I'm crazy! I'm out of my mind!

162
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,393
Are you crazy?

163
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:15,328
How could you do that unless you're crazy?

164
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,932
Cha Wooshik,
are you really out of your mind?

165
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:23,036
I'm crazy. That's for sure.

166
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,539
I'm crazy.

167
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,241
What do I do now?

168
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:29,909
Darn it!

169
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:34,814
Yuri, hurry up!

170
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,853
Gosh, that was so nerve-wrecking.

171
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:42,522
-I really thought we were caught.
-Exactly.

172
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,149
-But why is my brother like that?
-I don't know.

173
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,572
Anyway, use the guest room for today.

174
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,663
-We don't have any empty room.
-Really?

175
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,959
Wow, I guess your business
is going really well.

176
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:57,937
By the way, who's the girl that I
met for the first time just now?

177
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,814
Oh, it's our high school mate, Han Suyeon.

178
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:01,908
Really?

179
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,144
But...

180
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,646
...her name sounds very familiar.

181
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,648
Han Suyeon, Han...

182
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,351
Isn't she Wooshik's first love?

183
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:13,620
-How do you know that?
-Why wouldn't I?

184
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,588
I've read everything in
Wooshik's diary back then.

185
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:18,792
In his diary,
he put a lot of heart at her name.

186
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,094
Really? Cha Wooshik, this brat.

187
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:21,895
Wait a minute.

188
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,218
You even read his diary?

189
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:27,035
Hey, that's not the most
important thing right now!

190
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:29,144
That's right. I'm sorry.

191
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:32,939
But why is Suyeon here?

192
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:35,632
I remember she rejected Wooshik.

193
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:39,145
Well, Suyeon had some sort of problem.

194
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,949
Anyway, you should leave
before Wooshik wakes up tomorrow!

195
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,251
Or, I'll get kicked out as well.
You know it, right?

196
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,942
I get it.

197
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,556
Stop being so worried.

198
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,163
It's warm.

199
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,265
I feel much better now.

200
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,234
Kibong, turn off the lights.

201
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:02,635
Turn off the lights.

202
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,870
Sure.

203
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,377
-Go ahead and rest.
-Okay. Good night.

204
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:19,752
You just woke up?

205
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,649
Yes.

206
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,422
Why did you wake up so early?

207
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,257
I have work today.

208
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,059
Do you want some bread too?

209
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:27,060
No, it's fine.

210
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,564
So, I still like her?

211
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:34,267
But why? Why would I?

212
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,236
Does that make sense?

213
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,410
Why are you looking at someone like that?

214
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,708
So offensive.

215
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,302
When did I ever?

216
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,215
I'm looking there, not at you.

217
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,617
Are you a narcissist?

218
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:53,319
What did you say? This brat!

219
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:55,510
Why are you always letting
out your anger at me?

220
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,323
When did I do that? When?

221
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,828
Just forget it!

222
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,732
Look at that! Such a nasty temper!

223
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,634
Why would I like someone like her?

224
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,313
Wait a minute.

225
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,939
Was it because I have
been single for too long?

226
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,242
Because it has been a long
time since a woman touched me,

227
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,345
my heart probably fluttered
just for a moment.

228
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,047
What do I do if that's not right?

229
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,952
What? You want me to put it on you?

230
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,555
-Did you wake me up for this?
-It's something urgent.

231
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,356
Try and put it at this wound.

232
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,459
No! Just put it yourself,
why would you ask to do that?

233
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:34,661
Jeongeun!

234
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,676
Just put it once!

235
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,765
Can't you even do it for a friend?
So unloyal!

236
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,166
Fine. I'll do it.

237
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,468
My goodness!

238
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:48,575
What's this?
Why is it not pounding at all?

239
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,617
That's right!

240
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,414
Is it because she didn't blow into it?

241
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,950
Jeongeun, I'm sorry but can you...

242
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:00,119
-blow the wound for me?
-What?

243
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,121
Are you crazy? No way!

244
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,622
Please! It's very important for me!

245
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:07,427
So, just do it over here.

246
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,522
Blow air over it once.

247
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:11,731
Why are you asking me to
do weird things. Darn it.

248
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,539
-Satisfied?
-What is going on?

249
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,942
Instead of my heart fluttering, it feels
like it will stop because of her breath.

250
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,045
But Jeongeun is a woman like Suyeon.

251
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,647
So, why is my heart not fluttering?

252
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:31,417
Wait, she's not a woman like Suyeon.

253
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,721
In fact, Jeongeun is more like a man.

254
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:39,425
Now that I think of it, she looks exactly
like Sergeant Kim back in the military.

255
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,330
Sergeant Kim, the top marksman
known as Terminator of our platoon.

256
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,240
That's right. There's no way my
heart would flutter in this case.

257
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,210
My heart will surely flutter
if other woman put it on me.

258
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,213
I need to find other woman.

259
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,616
What's going on? What's wrong with him?

260
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,886
Let's start the cleaning.

261
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,790
Yuri must have left.

262
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:12,792
What are you doing there?

263
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:14,994
What the heck?

264
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,798
You're still here?

265
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,792
I told you to go before Wooshik wakes up!

266
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:23,569
I really intended on doing so...

267
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,872
-But I decided to stay.
-What did you say?

268
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,556
What are you saying?!

269
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,177
-You told me you'll leave in the morning!
-I did say that yesterday...

270
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,851
I have a change of heart. Sorry.

271
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,649
Are you really going to be like this?

272
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:38,934
Sure. Fine. Do whatever you want.

273
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,341
I won't care anymore even if you get
kicked out by Wooshik! Do you understand?

274
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,257
You can't ignore it though.

275
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,563
I'll hold it for you.

276
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,566
I'll be on your side.

277
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:56,469
Even if Wooshik ignores you,
I won't ever ignore you.

278
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,171
What is that?

279
00:13:58,346 --> 00:13:59,339
When did you...

280
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,473
Kibong...

281
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,576
We're on the same boat now.

282
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,858
So, you need to persuade Wooshik.

283
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:08,147
Persuade him to let me stay here.
Understand?

284
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,449
Darn it!

285
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,752
-How can such sister exist?
-Kibong, let's change the sheet.

286
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,654
Kibong!

287
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,522
Kibong!

288
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,822
What's going on?

289
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,225
Who's that with you?

290
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:21,427
Well, actually...

291
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,230
Who's that?

292
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,535
Hey, Kibong!

293
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:33,840
What the heck are you doing
at the sacred guesthouse?

294
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,145
Yes, I understand.

295
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,749
Finish what you're doing.

296
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:46,519
Oh my gosh!

297
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,025
-What did you just do?
-We didn't have any choice!

298
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,929
Even so, how can you do
that without permission.

299
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,631
You said that both of us will
get kicked out if caught.

300
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,633
I'm going crazy because of you!

301
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:04,039
That's why,
if you don't want to become crazier,

302
00:15:04,142 --> 00:15:05,938
hurry and persuade Wooshik. Okay?

303
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,540
Whatever!

304
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:12,612
Gosh, what a cute kid.

305
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,223
Hey! Hey Kibong! What happened just now?

306
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,721
-Who was that woman?
-Well, she's...

307
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,022
She's a guest.

308
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,024
What? A guest?

309
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,827
So, did you just kiss a guest?

310
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,630
Which guest? Who was it?

311
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,831
You don't need to know.

312
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,733
By the way, where's Wooshik?

313
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,134
Why are you suddenly looking for him?

314
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,803
Hurry up and tell me who was it!

315
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,709
Where are all the female guests at?

316
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,307
Wooshik! Hey, Wooshik!

317
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,410
-Aren't you worried about your sister?
-What?

318
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,912
Why are you suddenly talking about her?

319
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,032
It's because I'm worried about her.

320
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,818
It seems like she didn't have
any other place to go yesterday.

321
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,642
Why don't we just let her stay here?

322
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,512
What are you saying? Don't you
know what kind of person she is?

323
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,087
-No way.
-Hey!

324
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:57,790
She's your biological sister,
aren't you even worried about her?

325
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,492
When I say no, it means no.

326
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:00,903
What's wrong with you?

327
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,095
You heartless man!

328
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,597
Fine! Forget it!

329
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,821
-Where are you going? Who was it? Who?
-I told you it's a guest!

330
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:13,205
Why is he suddenly bringing
up Yuri and get all worked up?

331
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,006
That's right!

332
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,208
Other woman.

333
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,012
A woman.

334
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:23,916
My heart will surely flutter
if she put the ointment on me.

335
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,247
I'm positive.

336
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,593
Please.

337
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,393
Yes.

338
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,669
What's going on?

339
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,371
Why is my heart not pounding?

340
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,274
She's a woman just like Suyeon.

341
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,676
Why is my heart not pounding at all?

342
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:54,280
That's not right. They're not the same.

343
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,216
This woman is Japanese
and Suyeon is Korean.

344
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,518
They might both be woman,

345
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:01,420
Japanese is practically
hundred kilometers from here.

346
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,123
Psychologically, it's too far to work.

347
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,626
We also have a heart-wrenching history.

348
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:10,630
So, there might be an
unseen wall between us.

349
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,833
That's right.
There's no way my heart would flutter.

350
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,402
My heart will surely flutter if
a Korean put the ointment on me.

351
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,305
I need to find a Korean woman.

352
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:20,306
Korean.

353
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,345
No way! Impossible!

354
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,648
My first kiss...

355
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:31,651
I've cherished it for so long.

356
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,254
I can't believe such evil
woman stole it from me!

357
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,390
I need to clean it off!

358
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,559
I need to clean off her evil breath.

359
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,594
The evil breath!

360
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,367
What? Kibong was kissing with a guest?

361
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,969
Yes, he did!

362
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,640
On top of that, he did it so passionately
in the middle of the living room.

363
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,142
That's amazing!

364
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,832
He's calling me again.

365
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,315
Why? Who is it?

366
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,201
He's a part-timer at work.

367
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,919
He keeps calling me and following
me around. It's driving me crazy.

368
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,017
You?

369
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,152
His taste is so peculiar.

370
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:15,227
-Do you want to die?
-It's a joke. It's a joke. I'm joking.

371
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,832
I've rejected him but I don't
know why he's acting like this.

372
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,434
What don't you like about him?

373
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,270
Well, our personalities don't match,

374
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,940
and most importantly,
he looks so much like a rabbit.

375
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,609
-Rabbit?
-Yes.

376
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,001
He has two big teeth, and very big ears.

377
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,348
And he even has long beard like a rabbit.

378
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:36,849
Such person doesn't exist in the world.

379
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,551
All you do are lies.

380
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:40,553
And, what's so important
about people's looks?

381
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,955
You just need to be kind.

382
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,352
What vibration is this?
Hey, it's probably that rabbit guy again.

383
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,361
-It's not my phone.
-Something is ringing.

384
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:49,862
What's this?

385
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,664
Isn't this Kibong's cell phone?

386
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:52,865
It's his coach.

387
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,167
Hello, Coach. I'm Jungi, Kibong's friend.

388
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:57,770
You're looking for Kibong?
Wait a minute, Coach.

389
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:08,247
My stomach hurts.
Where was the toilet again?

390
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,449
Kibong?

391
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,558
-Kibong.
-What do I do?

392
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,395
Just a minute, coach.

393
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,764
What do you think you're...

394
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,566
Kibong?

395
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,869
Kibong, are you here?

396
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,774
Yes. Why? Why do you ask?

397
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:38,044
Answer the call. It's your coach
and there's something urgent.

398
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:41,847
I'm not in a situation
where I can answer it.

399
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:45,351
What are you talking about?
Your coach needs to talk to you...

400
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,319
What?

401
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,123
Four?

402
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,426
There are four legs?

403
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,228
Hey, Kibong!

404
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:58,531
What the heck are you doing in there?

405
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,833
Kibong, you... What?

406
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:11,110
Okay. I understand.

407
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,180
Coach, Kibong can't answer
your call right now.

408
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,883
If you tell me what it's
about, I'll deliver it to him.

409
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,281
What do you think you're doing?
Are you crazy?

410
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:25,059
I don't have any choice.

411
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,582
I was almost caught by Jungi.

412
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,561
But still, how could you come in here!

413
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,062
Hurry up and get out!

414
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:31,964
Get out now!

415
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,335
This is driving me crazy.

416
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,473
So, hurry and persuade Wooshik. Okay?

417
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,775
I say get out!

418
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,849
Okay?

419
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,517
What's going on?

420
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,551
Why is my heart not fluttering again?

421
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:57,022
She's a woman, and also Korean,
just like Suyeon.

422
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,125
Yet, why is my heart not pounding?

423
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:00,826
Is it perhaps?

424
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,728
May I know...

425
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,431
-...where are you from?
-I'm from Jeju Island.

426
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,251
-Of course, that's right!
-That startled me!

427
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,368
That's right, she's not the same.

428
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:12,438
This woman is from Jeju Island
and Suyeon is from Seoul.

429
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:15,251
They might both be from Korea,
but Jeju Island is different from Seoul.

430
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,648
It has a lot of wind, rocks and women.

431
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:19,368
They also have a lot of mawakrin.

432
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:21,339
A woman who grew up eating a
lot of mawakrin in Jeju Island,

433
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:23,340
and Suyeon who grew up in
Seoul with a lot of fine dust,

434
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,246
are in no way the same.

435
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:28,621
That's right.
There's no way my heart would flutter.

436
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,924
If a woman from Seoul put the ointment
on me, my heart will flutter for sure.

437
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:34,711
I need to find a woman from Seoul.
Seoul woman.

438
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,268
Darn it.

439
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:38,464
Hey, tell me who the woman was!

440
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:41,055
-Tell me who it is!
-Stop it!

441
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,735
Wooshik! Wooshik!

442
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,392
What do you want now?

443
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:45,471
Can't you just let Yuri in?

444
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,961
Let go. Why do you keep on
bringing her up since just now?

445
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:50,362
She's your one and only sibling.

446
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:52,044
Please just accept her.

447
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:54,580
Please save me.

448
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:56,482
How many times have I told you no?

449
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,384
You heartless man!

450
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,386
You're the meanest person in the world.

451
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,588
God darn it!

452
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,191
Why has he been talking
about Yuri since just now?

453
00:22:05,395 --> 00:22:08,093
Wooshik, I have big news!

454
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,182
In the shower, Kibong...

455
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,691
Whatever! I'm busy!

456
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:25,444
That devilish woman didn't
only steal my first kiss...

457
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,348
She also saw my naked body...

458
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:41,594
Dummy, I'm hungry.

459
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,997
I don't care even if you starve to death!

460
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,862
It's been so long since we had pizza.

461
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,060
-Exactly!
-Jeongeun.

462
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:53,172
Jeongeun, are you home?

463
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,174
What the? That's his voice.

464
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:56,113
Who do you mean?

465
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,264
Oh, the rabbit guy?

466
00:22:58,367 --> 00:22:59,745
I'm not here, okay?

467
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,771
Why do you have to go that far?

468
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,350
Just how does he look like...

469
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,178
Is Jeongeun home?

470
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,855
No, she's not.

471
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:11,156
I didn't see her.

472
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,560
She didn't even answer her phone.
I wonder where is she at?

473
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,067
Jeongeun!

474
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,367
Darn it!

475
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,570
Jeongeun, wait! Jeongeun!

476
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,940
Jeongeun, wait.

477
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,042
Jeongeun.

478
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,645
Jeongeun, wait a minute.

479
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,950
Jeongeun, hold on.

480
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:41,553
Why did you enter without knocking first?

481
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,889
Sorry, I'm not in a situation to do that.

482
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:46,292
Jeongeun...

483
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:49,561
-What should I do? What do I do?
-Jeongeun, let's talk for a minute.

484
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,499
Hey! Hey! Stop.

485
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,721
If he comes in, tell him I'm not here...

486
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:57,803
No, just tell him that I'm dead.

487
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,706
What are you doing?

488
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:13,077
Why is that brat,
Kibong not answering his phone?

489
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,787
I'm starving.

490
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,530
How could someone look
exactly like a rabbit?

491
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,732
It's so fascinating.

492
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:33,005
Kibong must be hungry too.

493
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,907
I should bring the pizza to him.

494
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:46,919
Move!

495
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,121
Who is it now?

496
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,224
Kibong, we're in trouble!

497
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:54,727
-Kibong!
-Darn it!

498
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,629
-Move!
-What are you...

499
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,732
Are you crazy? What do you think...

500
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,622
Kibong, I bought pizza. Have some.

501
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,202
Hey, you have so many legs.

502
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,506
Why are there so many legs?
Two, four, six.

503
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,108
There are six legs.

504
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:12,311
Six legs!

505
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,207
Kibong, you...

506
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,172
Why are there six...

507
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,184
Jungi, there's a misunderstanding...

508
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,958
Yes, I understood.

509
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:29,661
Kibong, pizza is not important right now.

510
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
You can do it!

511
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,665
Jungi, that's not it!

512
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:35,768
-Good luck!
-Hey!

513
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:39,571
Yuri, what did you just do?

514
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,673
Did Jungi leave?

515
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,976
Did rabbit leave?

516
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,078
-Yuri?
-Jeongeun?

517
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,281
Darn it!

518
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,788
This is driving me nuts.

519
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,690
Looking for woman born and
raised in Seoul is so hard.

520
00:25:58,775 --> 00:25:59,758
What do I do now?

521
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:02,661
Should we start the interview?

522
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,352
Let's see.

523
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:08,534
Your name is Han Suyeon?

524
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:09,835
Yes.

525
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,638
Your home is in Huam-dong?

526
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:17,230
Yes, I've lived in Huam-dong
from I was born until now.

527
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,410
Really?

528
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,731
Your father's business went bankrupt?

529
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:21,731
Yes.

530
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:25,818
My father was scammed and went bankrupt.

531
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,920
So, I had to break off engagement.

532
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:31,623
Now, I'm living with
my high school friends.

533
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:35,561
Excuse me.

534
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,637
What's going on?

535
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,639
Why is my heart not pounding again?

536
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,142
She's a Korean woman like Suyeon,

537
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:53,172
on top of that, her father went bankrupt
and she had to break off her engagement.

538
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,947
She's also living with
her high school friends,

539
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,655
she also shares the same name with Suyeon.

540
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,851
Why is my heart not fluttering at all?
Just why?

541
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,051
Darn it!

542
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,256
What the heck?

543
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,859
Does that mean I really like Suyeon?

544
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,062
It's been more than 10 years since
we've graduated from high school.

545
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,999
But I still have feelings for Suyeon?

546
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:15,868
Does that make sense?

547
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,171
That's impossible.

548
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:20,372
No way.

549
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,773
Wooshik!

550
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:28,046
"School Uniform Discount Event"

551
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:56,141
Wooshik, where were you from?

552
00:27:58,644 --> 00:27:59,344
Wooshik,

553
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,846
what's wrong with you?

554
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,347
Are you sick?

555
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,026
No way!

556
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,329
No!

557
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,446
No way!

558
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,434
No way!

559
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:25,003
No!

560
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,104
What the heck?

561
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,706
What's wrong with him?

562
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,918
Please, I beg you.

563
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:36,316
Dear heaven, please help Kibong...

564
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,442
Are they still in front of the door?

565
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:41,687
Yes, they're just standing
there in front of the door.

566
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:47,292
Anyway, Jeongeun...

567
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:50,051
Keep it a secret from
Wooshik that you saw me.

568
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,431
Yes, Yuri.

569
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,666
This is nuts. Wooshik will be here soon.

570
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:56,793
What are you going to do now?

571
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:01,640
Firstly, do whatever you can to get
Jungi and that rabbit guy out of here.

572
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,136
Okay.

573
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:06,227
You're still here?

574
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:09,142
Well, I saw Jeongeun go into
this room but she's not coming out.

575
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:11,241
That's not true. Jeongeun is not inside.

576
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:14,453
-No, I clearly saw she go in.
-Really?

577
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,329
You must be hungry.
Do you want some pizza?

578
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,451
-Do you want some carrot?
-No!

579
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:22,961
-I hate carrot!
-No. You look like you'd love them.

580
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,652
Kibong, how was it? What happened?

581
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:26,965
What were you doing on the bed?

582
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,166
That's not it.

583
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:30,362
What do you mean by that?
I've seen it all.

584
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:31,770
There were six feet under the blanket.

585
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,572
I'm sure two of it belong to my friend.

586
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:37,081
Then, whose feet do
the other four belong to?

587
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,077
No. Fine!

588
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,279
I'll tell you everything,
so let's go upstairs.

589
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:43,482
Really? You're going
to tell me everything?

590
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:45,284
You need to tell me in full details, okay?

591
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,085
I got it!

592
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,587
My goodness!

593
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,475
Come with us too.

594
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:52,078
Me? Why?

595
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,193
I'll tell you an interesting story, and
even give you carrot, so follow me. Hurry!

596
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:59,197
-No, I hate carrot!
-You look like you'd love them!

597
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:03,802
Yuri, it's clear. Come out now!

598
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:10,375
No way!

599
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,802
Why did my heart flutter again?

600
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,919
I guess I still like Suyeon.

601
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,823
Darn it! This is driving me nuts!

602
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,397
Goodness.

603
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,672
How did this roll out?

604
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,776
But I don't think it's this pen.

605
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:50,782
Yes, that's right. It's this pen!

606
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:53,178
Wait a minute.

607
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,157
Brother...

608
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:01,860
Hi!

609
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,931
Get out this instant!

610
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:10,235
I can't handle any more of your
trouble, so get out.

611
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,731
I won't cause any trouble.

612
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:16,141
I will behave really well from now on.
Wooshik, please...

613
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:19,644
Forget it. I won't be fooled
anymore, so leave right now.

614
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:22,247
Hey, you're being really mean.

615
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:24,716
You can let Suyeon,
your first love stay here.

616
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,112
Why can't you let me?

617
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,420
She also did something bad
to you a long time ago.

618
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:31,490
That's why you even cursed
her and tore her pictures!

619
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:32,391
What?

620
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,916
-But how do you know about that?
-Of course I know, I'd read your...

621
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,730
What? You read my diary?

622
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,437
That's right. You like her, right?

623
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:48,206
Like her? Who said that?

624
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:49,808
I've heard everything you said.

625
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,510
-You heard it wrong.
-What?

626
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,944
Is it?

627
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,018
I guess I still like Suyeon.

628
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,721
No, when did you...

629
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,382
Erase it right now.

630
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:11,363
Why? I guess Suyeon
can't find out about it?

631
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,698
Is that so?

632
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,303
Thank you.

633
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,608
-Brother, coke.
-Sure, Yuri.

634
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,114
-Pickle.
-Sure.

635
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:31,216
Here you go.

636
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,977
So fresh.

637
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,689
Hey, what's wrong with you?

638
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:40,392
-You said you'll never let her in?
-What?

639
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:42,561
I think she'd regretted her action.

640
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:46,097
And she's my one and only sister,
so I can't totally ignore her.

641
00:32:52,176 --> 00:32:53,905
What's going on right now?

642
00:32:55,676 --> 00:32:58,777
Hey, Kibong,
the woman who was with you just now...

643
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:02,614
No, the women. Who were they?
Who? Tell us!

644
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,402
-You don't have to know.
-Women?

645
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:08,119
This brat and a woman he just met...

646
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,922
He had his first kiss with
her, first shower...

647
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:14,331
Wait, that was Kibong's first kiss?

648
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,412
Wow!

649
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:17,028
I see.

650
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:18,830
Goodness! Darn it!

651
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:44,222
Hey, face reader.
Do I have the face of a King?

652
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:47,259
-What are you doing?
-Do I have a strange face?

653
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,451
Even a face reader is render speechless.

654
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:52,564
-What do you think...
-Sure, I'll change my question.

655
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,065
Hey, director.

656
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,867
Do I have the face of a lead role?

657
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,570
Or do I have the face of a supporting actor?
If not...

658
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,275
do I fail this audition?

659
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,613
Looking at your face,
it seems like I've failed again.

660
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,849
Tell me now!

661
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,631
Do I have the face of a male lead?

662
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,999
Or the face of a supporting actor?

663
00:34:25,236 --> 00:34:28,733
Why? Just why does it have
to be Han Suyeon again?

664
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:32,127
How much foolish am I going to be?

665
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:35,037
You're totally out of your mind!

666
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:36,541
Wooshik!

667
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:39,144
What? Why are you here?

668
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,501
-What are you two doing here?
-Brother, you left your phone.

669
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,118
We're here to give it to you.

670
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,219
I see.

671
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,439
You're welcome.

672
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:50,355
Sure.

673
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,454
Suyeon, what about you?

674
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:55,560
Because Yuri suddenly
forced me to come with her.

675
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:00,351
Well, we also want to see your work place,

676
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:03,057
and maybe have some tea.

677
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,672
Brother, you know what I mean, right?

678
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,374
What's wrong with her?

679
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,777
But looking at it now,

680
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,472
you and my brother
look good together.

681
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:17,678
You two look like a couple.

682
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,484
What are you saying all of a sudden?

683
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,072
It's just that you guys look
together now that I see you together.

684
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,389
What is this? You're practically
match-made in heaven.

685
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:27,492
Yuri, let's talk.

686
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:28,793
Wait here.

687
00:35:33,803 --> 00:35:36,801
-What are you plotting right now?
-What do you mean that?

688
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,603
This is all for you.

689
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,904
Why would it be for me?

690
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,806
You said you like her.

691
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,009
So, do well!

692
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,012
I will set up the right mood for you,

693
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,015
so brother, you just need to trust me.
Okay?

694
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,316
Yuri, are you crazy?

695
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:55,120
I never asked for help with Suyeon.

696
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,322
I don't want to be a fool again,

697
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,603
so please don't do anything.

698
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,331
Fool? What does he mean?

699
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,532
What? Director Hong
Hongseok recommended me?

700
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,043
Exactly.

701
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:19,831
I look forward to working with you.

702
00:36:19,915 --> 00:36:22,714
Thank you. Thank you so much.

703
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,718
Lately, I've been depressed
for failing all audition.

704
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:28,520
Thank you.

705
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,408
May I know what role...

706
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,524
Well...

707
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:33,525
It's the lead role...

708
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,626
Lead role?

709
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:36,020
Lead role's stand-in.

710
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:37,552
Stand in?

711
00:36:37,636 --> 00:36:42,333
Well, you look almost the same with
our lead role's physique and all.

712
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,636
But being a stand-in is a bit...

713
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,639
But, if you help me this one time,

714
00:36:47,946 --> 00:36:50,942
I'll make sure to give you an
important role on my next work.

715
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,143
Really?

716
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,445
Okay.

717
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:57,052
I'll do my best! My very best!

718
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:58,349
That's good!

719
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,253
By the way, who's the male lead?

720
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,656
Oh, there he is!

721
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,760
Yoo... Yoomin?

722
00:37:10,466 --> 00:37:11,362
Welcome.

723
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,267
Why are you telling me
to come when I'm so busy?

724
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,571
-Who is he?
-He's your stand-in this time.

725
00:37:19,676 --> 00:37:20,661
Greet him.

726
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:23,675
-Jungi, you know Yoomin, right?
-Of course.

727
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,778
No one in Korea would not
know who top star Yoomin is.

728
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,681
It's an honor to meet you.
I'm the actor, Lee Jungi.

729
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:33,151
-I don't need to know your name.
-What?

730
00:37:33,236 --> 00:37:34,652
I'll look forward to working with you.

731
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,157
Yes.

732
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:48,222
Drink that and leave. I need to work.

733
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,335
We got it.

734
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:55,032
Suyeon, I heard that you're
Wooshik's first love?

735
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:55,907
What?

736
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,243
That's what I heard too.

737
00:37:58,415 --> 00:37:59,644
I see.

738
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,748
Then, was Wooshik also your first love?

739
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,950
What? No, that's not true.

740
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:08,241
Why would I like a loser like him?

741
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,624
Yuri, my first love in high
school was someone else.

742
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,811
He was so handsome, so cool...

743
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:16,494
What's so wrong about my brother?

744
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:20,832
He's the only one in our
family with an IQ over 100.

745
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,121
He even got 15th place in elementary
school before. What's wrong with you?

746
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:24,102
-Yuri.
-What?

747
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,204
Stop it. That's nothing to brag about.

748
00:38:26,315 --> 00:38:28,731
Of course it is. Getting 15th is
such an amazing thing to do. Right?

749
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:29,707
Wooshik?

750
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,909
Yes, sir.

751
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:34,112
This singer will perform
at our pub starting today.

752
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:35,702
-Say hello.
-Ah, hello...

753
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,514
Hello.

754
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,217
-Seojun!
-Wooshik.

755
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:43,188
Suyeon.

756
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:46,591
Seojun...

757
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:51,362
It's been so long.

758
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,152
Isn't it the first time
since we graduated?

759
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,652
That's right. How have you been?

760
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,767
I'm doing alright.

761
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,436
How did you end up
living in the same house?

762
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,137
What?

763
00:39:01,846 --> 00:39:03,541
There was a bit of a situation.

764
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,742
I see.

765
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,544
Anyway, nice to meet you.

766
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:07,961
Let's have a drink.

767
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:12,350
-The drink is finished.
-I'll get it.

768
00:39:12,556 --> 00:39:13,985
Okay, thank you.

769
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:17,222
By the way, you've become a lot prettier.

770
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,025
You've become a lot cooler too.

771
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:29,735
"High School Band Club Concert"

772
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,043
It's Suyeon.

773
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,955
Why is she here so early?

774
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:54,158
"I love you"

775
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,177
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

776
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:17,782
So, you'll be performing here?

777
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,072
Yes, I...

778
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:21,853
Brother, who's that guy?

779
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,755
We were in a band together in high school.

780
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:24,555
Really?

781
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,826
But the atmosphere between
them is quite suspicious.

782
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,428
They have some history, don't they?

783
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,137
Tell me. What's their relationship?

784
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,632
He's Suyeon's first love.

785
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,433
What?

786
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,602
He is Suyeon's first love?

787
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:39,304
So, what you're saying is...

788
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,707
...you liked Suyeon back
then but she liked him?

789
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:43,808
I don't know.

790
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,777
It's not true?

791
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,380
My brother is so pitiful,
what should I do?

792
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,902
It's a good day today. Let's have a drink!

793
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,729
Which jerk is crying right now?

794
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,891
It's me, jerk.

795
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,669
It's Oh Daeshik.

796
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,374
For 10 years,

797
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,677
I've promised myself while in tears.

798
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,352
But do you jerks have to do that?

799
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:24,254
My seafood restaurant,

800
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:26,447
my mom,

801
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,154
do you have to take them...

802
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:34,559
...all from me?

803
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:37,962
Where do you think you are?
Do you want to die?

804
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:47,572
Okay, up until here.

805
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,876
You just need to do like what
Jungi did during rehearsal.

806
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:54,178
-Yoomin, do you understand?
-Okay, whatever.

807
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,149
Let's proceed with the shoot.

808
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,452
Have a good shoot.

809
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,554
Have a good shoot.

810
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,541
That rude jerk.

811
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,458
Have a good shoot.

812
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,161
Jungi, sorry for making you
do the rehearsal for him.

813
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,131
It's fine. Don't worry about me.

814
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,422
My seafood restaurant, my mom,

815
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:23,441
do you have to take them all from me?

816
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:24,642
You jerk!

817
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:28,346
Where do you think this is?
Do you want to die?

818
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:32,617
Hold on a minute.

819
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:33,618
Cut.

820
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:37,121
Yoomin, what's wrong? What is it?

821
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:39,714
I have to shoot a TV commercial this week,

822
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,411
so let's just ask the stand-in
to do the action scenes.

823
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:44,929
Stand-in? You need to
do at least this much...

824
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,815
Will you take the responsibility
if I get a scratch on my face?

825
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,334
No. Okay, I understand.

826
00:42:51,306 --> 00:42:52,637
-Lee Jungi.
-Yes?

827
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:54,439
-We need you.
-Okay.

828
00:42:57,415 --> 00:43:01,245
Oh yeah, instead of fainting
on the floor after getting hit,

829
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,448
make him fly and land on the table.

830
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:06,141
No, that's too small. Oh, that's right.

831
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:10,655
That table over there.
He should smash it as he's falling down.

832
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:14,459
I don't think you need to do that much.

833
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:17,349
Don't you know that this
is my first action movie?

834
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:19,751
I need to do it well to maintain my image.

835
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:23,267
And you know that this movie gets
its investment because of me, right?

836
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,762
Sure. Let's try it then.

837
00:43:25,846 --> 00:43:30,561
Jungi, fly over and fall on that table.

838
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,247
-What? What?
-Okay?

839
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,679
Okay. Yes, I understand.

840
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,581
Yes, you can do it.

841
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:40,184
Let's do it again. One more time.

842
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:44,455
Do it properly and make it look real.
Don't destroy my image.

843
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,851
Yes, sir. Yes.

844
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:11,382
Seems like Oh Daeshik is all washed out.

845
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,480
Are you already exhausted?

846
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:16,721
Must you provoke me like this?

847
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,823
This jerk!

848
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:19,824
Kneel.

849
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:21,826
Kneel!

850
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,081
Wait a minute!

851
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:25,863
Cut!

852
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,466
-Why?
-Let's use the stand-in from here.

853
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:30,791
I can't bruise my knee.

854
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,171
It's summer and I won't
be able to wear shorts.

855
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:36,092
Sure. Lee Jungi!

856
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:36,774
Yes?

857
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,276
Go.

858
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,979
Yes? Okay sure. Go in.

859
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:53,224
Before I die, must you...

860
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,994
...feed me jjajangmyeon as my last meal?

861
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:00,097
Jjajangmyeon...

862
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,201
-Hold on a minute!
-Cut!

863
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:06,502
Let's use a stand-in over here.

864
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:08,992
-I'm bad with chopsticks.
-What?

865
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,828
Sure. Lee Jungi!

866
00:45:10,913 --> 00:45:11,709
Enter.

867
00:45:14,216 --> 00:45:15,307
Yes, sir.

868
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:24,827
What a strong relief patch smell.

869
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,224
Are we eating rice or relief patch?

870
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:28,126
Just how many did you put on your body?

871
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,356
Let me be.

872
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,729
Every part of my body hurts.

873
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,737
Why did you take the stand-in role
when your face won't even show?

874
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:38,351
The director promised that he'll
cast me for his next movie.

875
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:39,637
However it is...

876
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:44,342
Hello?

877
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,558
Yes?

878
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:46,811
What?

879
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,714
Okay, I understand. I'll head there now.

880
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,516
-Why? Who was it?
-It's Yoomin...

881
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:54,585
...and he wants me to go
to his home right now.

882
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,087
I'll go now.

883
00:45:57,071 --> 00:45:59,290
-Eat slowly.
-Bye.

884
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:01,292
-See you later.
-See you.

885
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,395
Things need to work out for Jungi.

886
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,797
I feel so sorry for him.

887
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,499
Kibong...

888
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,788
Just think about getting
yourself into Major League.

889
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,803
I think you're much worse.

890
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:13,704
What?

891
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,307
I'm still better than you.

892
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:18,399
You're living off your
brother and his friends.

893
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:21,316
What? Living off? This brat!

894
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,415
Stop it! What are you doing
in the middle of a meal?

895
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,616
Gosh, that startled me!

896
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,217
-Is anyone home?
-Yes.

897
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,119
Who is it?

898
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:33,424
Seojun!

899
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:35,304
-Kibong.
-Yes!

900
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,427
-How long has it been?
-I know, right?

901
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:41,137
-I also heard about them meeting you...
-Our high school senior.

902
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:42,733
What are you doing here?

903
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,036
I came because it's been a
while since I last met you guys.

904
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:48,139
Good thinking.
Seojun, come and sit over here.

905
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,848
What the heck? Why is he here again?

906
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,557
Do you think it's because of Suyeon?

907
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:02,053
How would I know?

908
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,057
Brother! Brother!

909
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:09,860
My dear...

910
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,862
My brother must be worried.

911
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,932
I have no choice.

912
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,436
I'll have to step in.

913
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,740
-I can't see him.
-Where is he?

914
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:27,445
I can't see him. I can't see anything.

915
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,246
Yoomin must have ordered jjajangmyeon.

916
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,848
-He ordered jjajangmyeon!
-Oh my gosh!

917
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:32,249
He can see him inside!

918
00:47:32,361 --> 00:47:34,151
-What's inside there?
-What is it?

919
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,477
-My gosh!
-Are you going in?

920
00:47:39,177 --> 00:47:40,693
Here's the jjajangmyeon
with extra picked radish!

921
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,661
Why did you come so late?

922
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:44,662
Well...

923
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,766
I came here as soon as I got your call.

924
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,285
But, why did you want
me to put on a disguise?

925
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,472
It's none of your business.
Just take off your clothes.

926
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:56,073
What?

927
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,377
What?

928
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:02,380
You want me to stay here and
pretend to be like you?

929
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,483
You saw how it is full with
fans and paparazzi outside.

930
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:08,986
I have a very important thing to do
today, so please do me this favor.

931
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:10,488
Why?

932
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:12,301
You don't want to?

933
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:15,393
It's true that I'm your stand-in, but...

934
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,094
...this is a bit too much...

935
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,095
Sure.

936
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,630
Just forget it then.

937
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,407
I can just tell the director
to change the stand-in.

938
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:24,702
Change?

939
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,004
No, sir. I'll do it.

940
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,690
-I'll do it. I'll do it for you.
-You should've said that sooner.

941
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:32,277
You don't have to lock yourself in the
room, you can sit on the sofa here.

942
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:33,694
That will make it less suspicious.

943
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:34,678
Thank you.

944
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,881
Excuse me...

945
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,152
This is just too much...

946
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:45,556
He was known as Huam High's Volcano.
He was a legend.

947
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,459
-He was the leader of the band?
-On top of that,

948
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,654
he's a good singer and looks handsome.

949
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:53,947
There was no one who hadn't heard
of Yun Seojun of Huam High School.

950
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,233
-Right, Suyeon?
-That's right.

951
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,036
A lot of my friends also chased
after him because he's good looking.

952
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,639
I guess he looks alright.

953
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:05,042
No one can beat Wooshik
when it comes to looks.

954
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,347
What? Yuri,
what are you saying so suddenly?

955
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:11,949
To me, you look much better.

956
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,552
Wooshik is nothing compared to Seojun.

957
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:17,757
He's a traditional good-looking type.

958
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:18,757
I apologize.

959
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:21,459
Wooshik's face is the
trendy good-looking type.

960
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,061
Most women these days like
Wooshik's kind of face more.

961
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:26,964
-That's impossible.
-Should we ask others then?

962
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,566
The winner gets 100 thousand won, deal?

963
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,566
-Okay, deal!
-Deal!

964
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:31,844
Yuri, let's talk.

965
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,772
What's wrong with you?

966
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,568
What do you think you're doing right now?

967
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:37,876
Why do you make such bet?

968
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,479
I am doing all of this for you.

969
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,886
-Stay quiet.
-What?

970
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,479
What are you talking about?

971
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,263
That senior of yours,

972
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,385
it seems like he still likes Suyeon.

973
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,684
What if Suyeon falls for him again?

974
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:52,690
Do you want to lose her to him again?

975
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:54,496
What do you expect me to do?

976
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,394
That's why,
"Cha Wooshik is more handsome",

977
00:49:57,511 --> 00:50:00,998
"Cha Wooshik looks way
better than Yun Seojun."

978
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:04,201
You need to make sure
Suyeon realizes that.

979
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,992
Only then Suyeon will at least have some
interest in you. Don't you think so?

980
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,808
-Is it?
-Of course!

981
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,912
All women like good-looking men.

982
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,215
I do look kind of elegant.

983
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,317
I have that glamor.

984
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,022
Of course, you're my brother!

985
00:50:25,141 --> 00:50:26,824
The way I see it,

986
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,727
it's a game that you'll 100% win in.

987
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,030
-Just trust me.
-Okay, Yuri.

988
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:38,302
Okay, between Wooshik and Seojun,
let's decide on who's more good-looking.

989
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:40,304
Let's count the votes.

990
00:50:44,431 --> 00:50:47,211
It's a game that you'll 100% win in,

991
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:48,712
just trust me.

992
00:50:57,415 --> 00:50:58,622
"Cha Wooshik"

993
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,525
Cha Wooshik! Okay! See, I told you!

994
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,695
-I told you Wooshik looks better.
-Yuri, stop it.

995
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,397
You're embarrassing me.

996
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,199
That's impossible.

997
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:11,735
Next!

998
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:16,041
Yoon Seojun...

999
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:20,311
It's a tie. Neck and neck.

1000
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:21,612
That's right.

1001
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,014
"Cha Wooshik vs Yoon Seojun"

1002
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:25,215
Yoon Seojun.

1003
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,833
"Cha Wooshik: 1 vote,
Yoon Seojun: 11 votes"

1004
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,041
Yoon Seojun.

1005
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,121
Yoon Seojun.

1006
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:33,924
Yoon Seojun.

1007
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,417
Yoon Seojun.

1008
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,127
"Yoon Seojun"

1009
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:38,729
Yoon Seojun.

1010
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,101
"Cha Wooshik: 1 vote,
Yoon Seojun: 14 votes"

1011
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:46,203
14 over 1?

1012
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,406
This is impossible. It doesn't make sense.

1013
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,409
See, I've told you. It's a useless game.

1014
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,413
But, who was the one
person who picked Wooshik?

1015
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,415
The only person with a different taste.

1016
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,118
Did you vote for him?

1017
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,921
No, I didn't vote because I'm the judge.

1018
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,226
Then, who was it?

1019
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:06,824
The person who vote for Wooshik?

1020
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,258
Mr. Cha?

1021
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:10,027
Mr. Cha?

1022
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,046
None? Then?

1023
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:15,432
The person who wrote down
"Cha Wooshik" in red pen?

1024
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,736
Who's the person who agrees with me?

1025
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:19,941
What's going on?

1026
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,047
Wooshik,
did you perhaps write it yourself?

1027
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:27,077
I didn't! Who do you take me for?

1028
00:52:44,642 --> 00:52:45,729
Cha Wooshik!

1029
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,633
Did you really write your own name?

1030
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,835
You're so shameless.

1031
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:56,140
I can't believe this.
I didn't see this coming.

1032
00:52:56,761 --> 00:52:57,941
I can't accept this.

1033
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,943
Give us the 100 thousand won.

1034
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:03,814
Look at him?
What's lacking about his face?

1035
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,117
He looks like Park Bogum.

1036
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,618
In one glance,
he looks like Gongyoo's twins.

1037
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,520
See, one glance.

1038
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,525
One glance.

1039
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,189
-Right? One glance.
-Let go!

1040
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:13,396
Please just stop it!

1041
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:14,892
-Brother...
-Darn it!

1042
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:17,494
-Brother.
-Wooshik...

1043
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:19,396
Take back what you wrote.

1044
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,704
How long do I need to stay here?

1045
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:32,807
Do you have to...

1046
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:35,512
-That's our movie.
-...take it from me?

1047
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,481
When did they take that?

1048
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,286
Won't I come out too?

1049
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:43,016
I am with the famous actor, Yoomin.

1050
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,712
You're filming an action movie this time.
How was it?

1051
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,126
I am lacking in many ways,

1052
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:52,429
I just hope I'm not causing
the cast and crew any trouble.

1053
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,531
But won't action usually be a bit tough?

1054
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:55,928
-Of course it's tough.
-Yes, it's tough.

1055
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,835
It's tough and tiring,

1056
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,004
but I'm doing all the stunts by myself.

1057
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,500
I could use a stand-in, but I don't
think that's respectful for the fans.

1058
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,313
-You're so cool.
-No. It's a given to do that.

1059
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:11,515
-I am actually your fan.
-Really?

1060
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,118
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1061
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,521
-Hello, Yoomin.
-Are you doing well?

1062
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,022
Yes, of course.

1063
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,524
Well, yes...

1064
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,727
Honey, what are you doing?
Who are you talking to?

1065
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,028
The one I told you about.

1066
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,197
Oh, the puppet that's standing
in for you at your place?

1067
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,100
What are you saying? When did I say that?

1068
00:54:30,194 --> 00:54:32,002
Puppet?

1069
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,505
I'll be back soon. Hang in there.

1070
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:36,573
Wait a minute, sir.

1071
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,747
What? Puppet?

1072
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:45,582
Yoomin!

1073
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,586
You're looking down on Jungi, aren't you?

1074
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,594
Thanks to Yuri,
we're going to stuff ourselves today.

1075
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,503
Yuri, I'll enjoy the food. Thank you.

1076
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:02,299
Wooshik, thank you for being ugly too.

1077
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,569
Just shut up and eat.

1078
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:07,571
I'm sorry, Yuri.

1079
00:55:09,366 --> 00:55:12,776
Excuse me, but I feel like the
mood is ruined because of me.

1080
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:14,978
-Should I show you something fun?
-What is it?

1081
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,480
Okay.

1082
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:20,284
Look carefully.

1083
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:22,553
What's that?

1084
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,557
Nothing is on the tissue, right?

1085
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,357
Yes.

1086
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:30,561
I'll cover this glass with this tissue.

1087
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:41,572
What do you think will happen?

1088
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,173
I think the coin might have disappeared.

1089
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,775
Okay, look carefully.

1090
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,782
Nothing has happened.

1091
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:54,885
Suyeon, give me your hand.

1092
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:56,653
My hand?

1093
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,361
Abracadabra.

1094
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:05,762
Okay.

1095
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,375
We're putting it down.

1096
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,070
-Wow!
-Amazing!

1097
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:14,171
Amazing!

1098
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,773
Look at that! The cup disappeared!

1099
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,675
Wooshik, the drinking glass disappeared!

1100
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:21,879
You call that special talent?

1101
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,382
Wooshik is the best when it
comes to special talent too.

1102
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,483
What are you saying now?

1103
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,886
What? You do have one!

1104
00:56:28,976 --> 00:56:30,487
Something way more fascinating than that!

1105
00:56:30,677 --> 00:56:33,762
Wooshik does? No way, he doesn't have any.

1106
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,186
Are you looking down on him right now?

1107
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:37,777
-Yes.
-Then, do you want to make a bet?

1108
00:56:37,886 --> 00:56:39,872
This time it's 200 thousand won! Deal?

1109
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,802
200 thousand? Okay! Deal!

1110
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:43,200
Yuri, come and see me right now!

1111
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:47,313
-What is it now?
-Why are you being like this again?

1112
00:56:47,397 --> 00:56:49,606
You need to make up for the loss!

1113
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,816
Did you see how Suyeon loves his magic?

1114
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:54,414
So, what?

1115
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:56,113
What do you mean?

1116
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,923
"Cha Wooshik also has a special talent."

1117
00:56:58,007 --> 00:57:01,218
"Cha Wooshik's talent is more
fascinating than that Seojun guy."

1118
00:57:01,303 --> 00:57:02,419
You need to show that.

1119
00:57:02,528 --> 00:57:04,221
Show it properly!

1120
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:06,490
What is this?
Some kind of childish contest?

1121
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:07,690
Childish?

1122
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:10,503
Sure, forget it.

1123
00:57:10,587 --> 00:57:14,096
I won't care if he takes away the
girl that you like or whatever,

1124
00:57:14,487 --> 00:57:16,500
so do whatever you want.

1125
00:57:19,996 --> 00:57:21,104
I do have...

1126
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,706
...one special talent.

1127
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:39,222
Look at that.

1128
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:43,627
Wooshik, stop!

1129
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:44,928
What's wrong?

1130
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,129
Can't you tell?

1131
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,432
You've totally ruined the mood.

1132
00:57:49,226 --> 00:57:50,623
There's no other choice.

1133
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:52,386
Now, we need a game changer.

1134
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:53,904
What game changer?

1135
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,205
Just stand still.

1136
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:57,407
I'll take care of everything.

1137
00:57:58,697 --> 00:57:59,813
Just trust me.

1138
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:01,011
What will you do?

1139
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,215
Just now was a practice.

1140
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,674
Now is the real thing.

1141
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:09,686
Cha Wooshik,

1142
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:11,176
attention!

1143
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,593
Just be prepared, everyone.

1144
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,761
Here we go!

1145
00:58:35,552 --> 00:58:36,949
What did you do?

1146
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,649
We need to do this much to win.

1147
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,650
Wooshik...

1148
00:58:43,346 --> 00:58:44,463
You're the winner now.

1149
00:58:44,547 --> 00:58:45,455
No...

1150
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,759
What's the point of winning like this?

1151
00:58:48,854 --> 00:58:49,860
Why?

1152
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:55,766
You're driving me nuts!

1153
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:58,368
Darn it! Darn it!

1154
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,572
Wooshik, where are you going? You've won!

1155
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:04,674
-You win!
-Win what?

1156
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,689
The player went out. He forfeited.

1157
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:08,378
Yes! I got money again.

1158
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:13,697
Yes, Jungi.

1159
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:16,386
Wow, this place is amazing!

1160
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,398
Hey, Jungi!

1161
00:59:20,494 --> 00:59:22,292
Kibong, you're here?

1162
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,594
So this is how Yoomin's house looks like.

1163
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,696
-But why are you here?
-That's not important.

1164
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,702
Is this what I wanted to borrow?

1165
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:30,967
Yes. But why do you need it?

1166
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,669
And what's Ichiro's autographed bat for?

1167
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,572
There's a reason for everything.

1168
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,875
Okay, why don't we start?

1169
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:42,079
So, what do we do now?

1170
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,780
Why do you even ask?

1171
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,083
Let's have a blast of time!

1172
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:47,951
A blast? How?

1173
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,052
How?

1174
00:59:49,547 --> 00:59:51,054
Like this! This way!

1175
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,255
-Like this.
-Why are you hitting me?

1176
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,057
You're dead today!

1177
01:00:01,027 --> 01:00:02,532
-Oh my gosh!
-What's wrong with him?

1178
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:04,813
-What are they doing?
-My gosh.

1179
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:08,305
-Stop taking pictures.
-I can't see. Move!

But is it okay for us to do that?

Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

Yoomin is calling.

Why is the top star Yoomin calling me?

1190
01:00:30,487 --> 01:00:31,294
Hey!

1191
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,599
What are these articles about?

1192
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,599
What did you do at my home?

1193
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,012
Why? What did I do?

1194
01:00:37,096 --> 01:00:38,301
Are you really asking me that?

1195
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:40,303
Explain that it's not me!

1196
01:00:40,397 --> 01:00:43,173
Explain that you were
there as my stand-in!

1197
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:44,662
What stand-in?

1198
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,675
No way.

1199
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,278
It's not respectful to
the fans to use stand-in,

1200
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,981
so you did everything by
yourself, don't you?

1201
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:53,183
-What?
-Hey!

1202
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,285
You have a lot of money.

1203
01:00:56,107 --> 01:00:57,487
And a lot of popularity.

1204
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:00,257
You even have a girlfriend.

1205
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:02,359
Do you have to...

1206
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,855
...take everything from...

1207
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,472
...a stand-in actor?

1208
01:01:09,556 --> 01:01:11,173
-What did you say?
-Hey!

1209
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:12,769
You just wait!

1210
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,071
I'll make sure to be successful,

1211
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:18,441
and use you as my stand-in actor.
Do you understand?

1212
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:22,153
It won't be long, so just wait!

1213
01:01:22,237 --> 01:01:23,046
I'm hanging up!

1214
01:01:23,536 --> 01:01:24,447
Good job!

1215
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,367
Good job!

1216
01:01:30,647 --> 01:01:32,355
I feel good.

1217
01:01:35,886 --> 01:01:37,460
It's all because of Yuri!

1218
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,363
I humiliated myself in front of Suyeon.

1219
01:01:43,442 --> 01:01:44,810
What are you doing here?

1220
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:46,939
Suyeon!

1221
01:01:52,086 --> 01:01:53,412
Why are you here?

1222
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:55,712
I went to look for you
because you didn't come back.

1223
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,314
Goodness...

1224
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,217
Why did you exaggerate today?
So embarrassing.

1225
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,997
Of course you'd be embarrassed.

1226
01:02:05,082 --> 01:02:07,090
You met your first love in ten years,

1227
01:02:07,296 --> 01:02:10,093
and I made such a scene in front of him.

1228
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:12,095
That must be so embarrassing.

1229
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:12,896
What?

1230
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,598
First love?

1231
01:02:14,683 --> 01:02:15,322
Who?

1232
01:02:15,406 --> 01:02:16,800
I know everything.

1233
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,302
Seojun was your first love.

1234
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,893
That's why you always
came to our practice room.

1235
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:23,807
What nonsense is that?

1236
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,109
He was not my first love.

1237
01:02:26,216 --> 01:02:27,410
Yeah, right.

1238
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:29,312
Without even knowing that,

1239
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:32,082
I wanted to sing the song that you liked.

1240
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:34,184
So I held the guitar all night...

1241
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,287
I practiced until my hand bled.

1242
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,489
Forget it.

1243
01:02:40,097 --> 01:02:42,279
I was stupid for being mistaken.

1244
01:02:46,607 --> 01:02:47,998
You weren't mistaken.

1245
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,100
What?

1246
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,703
I said you weren't mistaken.

1247
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,887
How can someone like you be my first love.

1248
01:03:00,687 --> 01:03:01,378
What?

1249
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,380
What do you mean?

1250
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,683
You were my first love.

1251
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,785
Cha Wooshik, you were my first love.

1252
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,620
Yesterday, you said it wasn't me?

1253
01:03:10,806 --> 01:03:13,189
You said your first love was someone else.

1254
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:17,802
How can I say that right in front of you?

1255
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,998
Do you remember the first day we
met each other at the music room?

1256
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,301
That...

1257
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,603
...was not a coincidence.

1258
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,235
What are you doing here?

1259
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:00,737
That startled me!

1260
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:04,441
-Suyeon...
-Did I startle you?

1261
01:04:04,816 --> 01:04:07,243
I was walking by and
heard the guitar sound.

1262
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:14,651
Is that true?

1263
01:04:15,756 --> 01:04:17,420
Then, on the day of
our band's performance,

1264
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:18,604
what was that?

1265
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:20,523
What do you mean?

1266
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:23,126
On that day, you and...

1267
01:04:23,636 --> 01:04:25,128
...Seojun were...

1268
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:27,731
...kissing and I saw it.

1269
01:04:27,836 --> 01:04:29,733
What? Kiss?

1270
01:04:33,446 --> 01:04:35,823
Wooshik, that was not it.

1271
01:04:45,846 --> 01:04:46,850
Hey Suyeon...

1272
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:50,453
It's still early for the concert.
Why are you here?

1273
01:04:51,351 --> 01:04:52,442
I just feel like it.

1274
01:04:52,648 --> 01:04:54,035
But where's Wooshik?

1275
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:55,625
I don't know. I guess he'll be here soon.

1276
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:02,232
-Thank you.
-That's not for you...

1277
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:14,110
What do you think you're doing?

1278
01:05:14,216 --> 01:05:15,502
Suyeon, what's wrong?

1279
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:16,813
Are you crazy?

1280
01:05:16,986 --> 01:05:18,397
What do you think you're doing?

1281
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,517
Didn't you like me?

1282
01:05:21,426 --> 01:05:22,318
What?

1283
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:23,935
No, I don't!

1284
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,922
Give me that bouquet!

1285
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,628
Cha Wooshik, you fool!

1286
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:34,831
Actually, I like you.

1287
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:38,435
I was waiting for your confession
but I'll confess first.

1288
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:41,104
Good luck for today's performance.
You can do it!

1289
01:05:45,486 --> 01:05:46,609
Really?

1290
01:05:46,716 --> 01:05:49,232
You should have told me such things!

1291
01:05:49,316 --> 01:05:51,214
How can I tell you?

1292
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:53,616
Have you ever talked to me after that day?

1293
01:05:53,727 --> 01:05:56,219
You avoided me every time we
met and rejected all my calls.

1294
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:00,890
Wait.

1295
01:06:01,397 --> 01:06:04,994
Are you telling me that the reason you
were annoyed and treating me badly...

1296
01:06:05,107 --> 01:06:06,396
...was all because of that?

1297
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:08,198
No! That's not the reason.

1298
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,903
Right, I know you're a loser,
but you can't be that lame.

1299
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:20,076
It's cold. Let's go back.

1300
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:21,077
What?

1301
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,979
Just go back first.

1302
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,481
I'll go back later.

1303
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,083
Alright, don't stay out too late.

1304
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:38,394
Darn it!

1305
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,897
That means I was Suyeon's first love?

1306
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:44,367
And I hated Suyeon for 10 years
without even knowing that?

1307
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:48,293
This fool! You fool!

1308
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,678
My gosh! This is nuts!

1309
01:06:59,285 --> 01:07:02,685
You fool! You dimwit!

1310
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:12,795
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1311
01:07:13,506 --> 01:07:15,698
She told me I was her first love.

1312
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,867
Wooshik, are you seeing someone lately?

1313
01:07:17,973 --> 01:07:20,393
-Hey, are you going to date her?
-I'm convinced...

1314
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:22,162
...that Suyeon has feelings for
me, like you said.

1315
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:24,965
-You want me to sell my dream?
-Nothing works for me these days.

1316
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,573
You're going to hold in until
tomorrow, without going to the toilet?

1317
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:31,685
I got called in for an audition for
a movie that I really wanted to do.

1318
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:33,786
-I bought the dream back.
-Let's go!

1319
01:07:33,876 --> 01:07:35,473
-Kibong, good luck today.
-Yes, you too...

1320
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:36,773
Kibong, good luck today.

1321
01:07:36,857 --> 01:07:40,156
Don't be surprised.
I have to do everything four times.

1322
01:07:40,267 --> 01:07:41,758
Hani is on my team?

1323
01:07:41,867 --> 01:07:43,760
I must finish it with this throw.

1324
01:07:43,937 --> 01:07:45,828
-No matter what!
-Throw it! Throw it!
