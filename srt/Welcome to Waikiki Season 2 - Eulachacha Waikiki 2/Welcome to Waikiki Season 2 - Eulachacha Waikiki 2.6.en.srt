1
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:11,148
Stop. I told you that's not how you do it.

2
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:15,048
This song requires the faint voice
between your head and nose.

3
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:17,496
You need to sing with your forehead.

4
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,712
♪Faint voice, faint voice.

5
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:24,228
How can you fail this?

6
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:25,676
Try it.

7
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,674
Stop! Do you think singing is a joke?

8
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,951
And you call yourself a singer?
Just quit already.

9
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,465
Stop it, come on. You're being too harsh.

10
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:37,092
Go get some fresh air.

11
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:38,010
Okay.

12
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:39,728
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,154
Go easy on him.

14
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,951
Do you know that everyone's calling
you "evil trainer" around here?

15
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:48,920
Look, all I know is that...

16
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,107
...I can't stand people
singing halfheartedly.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,392
You know that too.

18
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:54,259
You haven't changed a bit.

19
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:57,160
Oh, right. Since I'm here,
can you check my singing?

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,514
My singing's out of tune these days.

21
00:00:58,598 --> 00:00:59,431
Really?

22
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,114
Okay. Go ahead.

23
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,658
Stop, stop!

24
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,201
How can you be this bad
when you have all that experience?

25
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:28,210
Is it singing if you scream
at the top of your lungs?

26
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:31,363
There's no emotion
that touches the heart.

27
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:32,480
Oh, really?

28
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,152
And why do you keep shaking your hands?

29
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:37,043
Do you have hand tremor? What is this?

30
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:38,148
Do you sing with your hand?

31
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,156
Why not stick a microphone
on your hand too?

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,666
Even you get to be a singer
while I'm training little kids.

33
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,035
How is this fair?

34
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,937
Darn this world!

35
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,248
It's our yearbook.

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,691
It's been a while.

37
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,357
This is bringing back memories.

38
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:11,132
It's me.

39
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:14,719
My skin was so firm and pretty back then.

40
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,670
I see.

41
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:19,722
By the way, did you have
a crush on anybody?

42
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,639
What?

43
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,542
Well, I did have a crush.

44
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,316
Actually...

45
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,502
...Wooshik was my first love.

46
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:30,784
-Why?
-Because he was nice.

47
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:34,284
No matter what anyone said, he never
got angry and smiled like an idiot.

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,806
Wooshik was nice?

49
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,446
That guy who's prickly like a diva?

50
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,947
Now he's changed a little bit,
but he was really nice back then.

51
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:44,870
Maybe it's because I'm mean.
But I like nice guys.

52
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:47,221
Oh, you have to keep this a secret.

53
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,352
Okay.

54
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,717
Let's keep cleaning before
Wooshik starts nagging.

55
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,046
Okay.

56
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,104
We're almost done here
so let's go to the second floor.

57
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,675
Is that so?

58
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,556
What is this? Where is everyone?

59
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,075
I bought this a few days ago.

60
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,939
Who broke this?

61
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,650
Brother. Shush.

62
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:16,881
Don't shush me!

63
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,567
Oh, it was you, wasn't it? Tell me!

64
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,389
Gosh, I told you to be quiet!

65
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,342
What's the matter with you?

66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,528
Brother, I overheard Jeongeun
and Suyeon talking just now.

67
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,663
Suyeon's ideal type is a nice guy.

68
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,633
-A nice guy?
-Yes.

69
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,762
She liked you back in the day
because you were nice.

70
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,640
You never got angry and
just smiled all the time.

71
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:43,690
Oh, really?

72
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,906
So what?

73
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,557
You clueless idiot.

74
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:48,750
Suyeon's ideal type is a nice guy.

75
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:53,018
Do you think it's okay to go berserk
to find the person who broke this broom?

76
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,200
It's not okay.

77
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:56,258
Then what do you have to do now?

78
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,779
Should I stop looking
for the culprit? Or...

79
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,993
Should I buy a new broom?

80
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:01,338
You dumbass.

81
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:02,880
What was that for?

82
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:11,045
So... You made all this?
What's the occasion?

83
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,244
Well, you know...

84
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:15,921
...you guys seem tired lately
so I just cooked for you.

85
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,144
Oh, my. You did?

86
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:21,629
Wooshik, you're such a nice guy.

87
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,296
Right, Suyeon?

88
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,769
What? Oh, yes.

89
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:28,685
Come on. It's not even a big deal.

90
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,041
Go on. Help yourselves.

91
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:31,394
Kibong, can you pass me the water?

92
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,811
Water? Sure.

93
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,966
-Cold!
-I'm sorry, Wooshik.

94
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,078
Why, you...!

95
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,351
It's okay.

96
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:48,912
I was burning up from the cooking
so that felt nice and cool.

97
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,301
Go ahead and eat. It's okay.

98
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:52,184
But I still feel sorry.
Let me wipe this for you.

99
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:53,601
It's okay, I'll do it.

100
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:55,785
Oh that's hot!

101
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:57,393
Wooshik!

102
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:59,884
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

103
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,302
Why, you...!

104
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:07,829
It's okay.

105
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,367
I was feeling cold but now it's all warm.

106
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,537
It's all good. Go ahead and eat.

107
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,221
Everyone spills soup once in their lives.

108
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,142
"Filming in Progress,
'Son the Guest House'"

109
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:26,386
-Hello.
-Hello.

110
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,272
-Hello, I'm Lee Jungi.
-Hello.

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,553
The smell of the set.

112
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:34,324
Goodness. Then how did you refrain
yourself all this time?

113
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,580
Jungi, do you think I can pull this off?

114
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,318
You'll be fine.

115
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:41,241
Just relax and do as you practiced.

116
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,645
What is your name?

117
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:53,486
Park Yido...!

118
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,375
Park Yido? So it was you.

119
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,113
In the name of the Lord...

120
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,895
...I command you to leave
this man's body at once!

121
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:21,444
Hyungcheol!

122
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,968
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked?

123
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,588
-What?
-Cut!

124
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,962
Jeongeun, what are you doing?

125
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,437
Your acting's like a robot.

126
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,062
You have to bring some tension.

127
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:33,178
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:34,859
All right, let's go again.

129
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,847
Okay.

130
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,821
Ready, action!

131
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,568
What is your name?

132
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:45,705
Park Yido...!

133
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:48,209
Park Yido?

134
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:49,759
So it was you.

135
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,445
In the name of the Lord...

136
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:54,180
...I command you to leave
this man's body at once!

137
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,078
Hyungcheol!

138
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:02,608
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked.

139
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,450
-Jeez, you freaked me out.
-Cut!

140
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,745
Again.

141
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:09,879
Hyungcheol!

142
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:12,470
You okay? You must've been shocked.

143
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:13,866
Again.

144
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:16,846
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked.

145
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,381
-Say what?
-Cut!

146
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:22,309
Darn it.

147
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,871
Jeez, why isn't she coming out?

148
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:33,540
Ouch, my throat. My mouth went
dry from all the spitting.

149
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,195
-Jungi.
-Hey, how was my acting today?

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,467
-What did the director say?
-I don't know!

151
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:41,924
What's with your friend?
You said she's good at acting.

152
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,809
She's just nervous because
she hasn't acted in a while.

153
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,732
-She'll do well next time.
-It's too late.

154
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,514
The director wants to replace her.

155
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,776
Wait, replace her?

156
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,371
You mean Jeongeun's been fired?

157
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,400
Come on, that's not right.

158
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,347
Whatever, I don't care.

159
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:57,528
Anyhow, you tell her
since she's your friend.

160
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:00,862
What? Hey, wait. Hey!

161
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:02,708
Darn it. What?

162
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,599
I'm going to lose it.

163
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,964
Jungi, have you been waiting long?

164
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,754
Oh... No, no.

165
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,753
I made too many mistakes today, didn't I?

166
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,611
It's hard because it's been a while.

167
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:15,655
Jeongeun, the thing is...

168
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:18,546
But you know what? I was so happy today.

169
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,464
What?

170
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,034
Thanks so much.

171
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,508
I wouldn't have started acting
again if it weren't for you.

172
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,446
-What?
-To show you how thankful I am...

173
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:27,073
...I'll do my best.

174
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,212
All right, sure.

175
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,314
Weren't you about to say
something just now?

176
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:39,122
No, it was nothing. Let's go.

177
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,398
Gosh, it stings.

178
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,765
Event with ointment on it still stings.

179
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,117
That punk Kibong is so clumsy!

180
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,199
But you held back pretty well.

181
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,239
I was so nervous that
you'd get angry again.

182
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,170
Anyway, you must never blow up
in front of Suyeon. Got it?

183
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,630
It's not easy.

184
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:06,079
It's so hard. I can't do it anymore.

185
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:07,790
I'm back.

186
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:08,921
You're back!

187
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,301
You must be tired from your shift.
Aren't you hungry?

188
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:13,864
No, I have no appetite.

189
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:16,705
What's the matter?? Did something happen?

190
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,860
I was working at an event and
I got scolded for being a bad singer.

191
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,237
Hey, you should take
lessons from Wooshik.

192
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,982
He's a vocal trainer.

193
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:26,969
Really?

194
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:27,935
Yes.

195
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,661
Wooshik, can you teach me how to sing?

196
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:31,586
What?

197
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,716
Yeah, sure. Okay.

198
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,251
Thanks, Wooshik.

199
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,337
I'll just go get changed and come back.

200
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,600
Hey, why'd you bring up
singing lessons all of a sudden?

201
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:45,406
Why not? It's a good opportunity
for you to score points.

202
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:48,033
And it'll be just the two
of you in a room.

203
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,661
You can teach her how to
sing and have a chat too.

204
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,861
Then you'll kiss her, get
married, and have kids with her.

205
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:54,215
That's the way it is.

206
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,016
Come on, that's ridiculous.

207
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,797
Stop talking complete nonsense.

208
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,594
Wooshik! I'm here.

209
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:09,128
Oh, you're here?

210
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:10,046
Yeah.

211
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,846
What should I start with?

212
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:14,955
Can you sing any song that you like?

213
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,614
I like IU's songs.

214
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,764
My tone is pretty similar to IU's.

215
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,411
Wow, I can't wait to hear it.

216
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,604
Okay then. I'll start.

217
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:50,464
How was it?

218
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,020
Wooshik, how was it?

219
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:57,682
Oh, well...

220
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,654
It's all good but...

221
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,131
...you were slightly off-key...
and the rhythm was slightly off-beat.

222
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:08,311
Your pitch is a bit low,
and you ran out of breath too.

223
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:10,273
That's about it.

224
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:14,410
Oh, really? I see.

225
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:17,487
It's okay. It can be corrected.

226
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:18,834
Shall we sing one line at a time?

227
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:32,535
-Got it?
-Oh, that's how you do it.

228
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,615
It's all clear to me now
that I heard you sing.

229
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,968
Really? Then, let's try again.

230
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:36,887
Okay.

231
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:42,820
Stop!

232
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:45,335
It still sounds the same.
Didn't you say you got it?

233
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,331
Why? I thought I sang
just like how you taught me.

234
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:51,153
But, why are you getting all angry?

235
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:53,893
What? Oh no, it's not like that.

236
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,015
I wasn't being angry.

237
00:11:57,051 --> 00:12:00,420
Okay, Suyeon. Shall we try
one bar at a time?

238
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,973
That's it. Now, sing them together.

239
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,983
Stop, stop! Han Suyeon!
Do you think this is a joke?

240
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:25,915
Is singing a joke to you?

241
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,754
I can't sing like that even if I try.

242
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,810
And what? Your tone is similar to IU's?

243
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,616
IU will flip out and faint.

244
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,502
Gosh, you little...!

245
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,734
Why, you...!

246
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:37,572
Wooshik.

247
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,652
What's wrong, Wooshik?
Why are you glaring at me like that?

248
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:46,912
No, I wasn't. I was just
admiring your singing.

249
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,538
It was so soft and sweet.

250
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:50,552
Really?

251
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,018
Then I'll sing again from the beginning.

252
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:53,936
What?

253
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,284
Hey, is the lesson over?

254
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,488
How was it? Did you have fun?

255
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:09,406
Yes, Yuri.

256
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,026
Thanks to him teaching me so kindly,
I think I've made some improvements.

257
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,828
Teacher, I'll look forward
to your lesson tomorrow.

258
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,454
It seems like you two hit it off.

259
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,147
Brother, why do you have
that look on your face?

260
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,729
Don't even get me started.

261
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,251
I've never seen anyone who's
as tone-deaf as she is.

262
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,654
Tone-deaf?

263
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,335
-You mean, Suyeon?
-Yes.

264
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,091
It was almost an insult to the song.

265
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,820
But you know what else?

266
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:42,807
She's completely unaware
that she's tone-deaf.

267
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:44,557
When Suyeon starts singing...

268
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:48,717
...I start feeling this surge of rage
rising from my chest.

269
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,400
I almost started to hate her.

270
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,500
Really?

271
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,588
Just how bad is her singing?

272
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,406
Try to tolerate her.

273
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,662
You must not lose your temper. Okay?

274
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:03,832
Okay.

275
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:09,846
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked.

276
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,784
Which one is the best out of the three?

277
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:13,121
What?

278
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,081
I think they're all good.
Yes, they're all nice.

279
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,823
Really? I must be getting the hang of it
again after practicing all night.

280
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:22,966
I can't wait to go to the studio again.

281
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:28,936
Jeongeun, I have something to tell you.

282
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,344
Something to tell me? What is it?

283
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:33,400
You know, filming tends to...

284
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:35,975
-Hold on.
-Hold on, okay.

285
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,475
Hello? Dad!

286
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,695
The shoot? Of course I did well.

287
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,213
Don't you worry.

288
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,272
I won't let you down this time.

289
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,264
Why are you crying?

290
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,823
Okay.

291
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,948
When the movie's released,
I'll invite you to the preview.

292
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,185
Okay. Bye.

293
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,794
Why? What's wrong?

294
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:05,943
Why are you crying?

295
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:08,174
My dad is so happy.

296
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,275
It's making me cry.

297
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,602
By the way, didn't you have
something to tell me?

298
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,524
You got... No, no. It's nothing.

299
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:22,442
Really?

300
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,671
Then I'll go wash my face.

301
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,378
This is killing me!

302
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,473
What's up with you? Is something wrong?

303
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,077
Kibong, the thing is...

304
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,732
What? Jeongeun got fired?

305
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:48,967
Yeah.

306
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:52,779
But I just can't tell her
because she'll be disappointed.

307
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,473
-Then don't tell her.
-What?

308
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:57,843
Then what about the shoot tomorrow?
She'll find out anyway.

309
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:58,843
Then you should tell her.

310
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:02,385
She just started acting again.
What if she gives up?

311
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:04,043
-Then don't tell her.
-What?

312
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,700
You dumbass.

313
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,307
I'm the nut job to listen
to a dumbass like you.

314
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,521
Die! Die, you lunatic. Die!

315
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,029
Stop, stop. Please stop.

316
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,927
Why? Was it weird?

317
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,422
No, it's not that.

318
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:34,207
I just don't think that
this is the right song for you.

319
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,010
It is a difficult song, too.

320
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,866
Is there another song that's
just a little bit easier?

321
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:43,150
Another song? Well...

322
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:45,223
...how about IU's "Good Day"?

323
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:48,132
What? "Good Day"? The song
with the level 3 high notes?

324
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,437
Yes. One thing I know is that
I'm pretty good with high notes.

325
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,355
Do you want to hear?

326
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:57,848
One, two...

327
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:11,353
How was it?

328
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,037
Oh, well...

329
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,975
It was good. It was, but...

330
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm just getting this slight feeling...

331
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:26,017
...that your vocal range is just
teeny-tiny bit low for level 3 high notes.

332
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:30,581
Then I'll try again
with the highest pitch possible.

333
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:31,858
-Oh my
-Oh my.

334
00:17:31,943 --> 00:17:33,009
One, two...

335
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,933
Stop, stop! Han Suyeon!

336
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:48,142
You call that "level 3 high notes"?

337
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:50,775
Only your hand was raised three times
but the tone was still the same.

338
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,729
I can achieve a level 30 note like that.
You want to see?

339
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,515
See? Is this a level 30 note if I do that?

340
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,436
Is it?

341
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:08,494
Do you have a hearing problem?

342
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:11,418
I said, "Do you?"

343
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,374
Wooshik! How was my level 3 note?

344
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:18,284
Oh. It's much better.

345
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:21,005
I was so impressed.

346
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,624
Right? Then, I'll sing
again from the start.

347
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,202
Oh my.

348
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:36,442
One, two...

349
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,710
Your face got haggard in just one week.

350
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,313
Yuri, it's too much for me.

351
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:56,169
I've lost my appetite and I get
nightmares every time I close my eyes.

352
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,404
My heart starts pounding
when I see IU on TV.

353
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:06,040
How bad must her singing be
for you to become such a mess?

354
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:08,461
IU? IU!

355
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:09,395
It's okay.

356
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,820
Jungi, you have a shoot today, right?

357
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,942
Yeah.

358
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:17,189
Did you tell Jeongeun?

359
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:18,970
-No
-Still?

360
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:20,860
What are you going to do?

361
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:23,128
Jungi! Did you sleep well?

362
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,569
What day is it today? It's filming day!

363
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:28,300
Give me a minute.
I'll be back right out with my things.

364
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,522
Look at her, look. She's over the moon.

365
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:38,411
How can I tell her
when she's so delighted?

366
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,447
This is driving me nuts!

367
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,726
Kibong, do you have any good ideas?

368
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,022
Then just tell her
that the movie's been canceled.

369
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:47,939
What?

370
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,385
Then what about me?
I need to go to the shooting.

371
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,759
You can just say that you're
going out for some fresh air.

372
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,424
What? Fresh air?

373
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:03,751
You're a genius! I thought you
were a dumbass, but I guess not.

374
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,853
Genius!

375
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:09,564
-Jeongeun.
-What?

376
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,028
I was just about to go out.

377
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:12,587
The thing is...

378
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,168
How should I put this?

379
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,615
I just got a call from
the production company...

380
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:18,003
...that the movie's been canceled.

381
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,704
What? What are you talking about?

382
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:25,044
The investors pulled their funds
so the production had to be shut down.

383
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,912
-Really?
-Yes.

384
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,996
I never thought that this would happen.

385
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:34,048
Don't get so upset.

386
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,180
I'm sure there will be
another opportunity.

387
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,392
For you and me both.

388
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,206
Get some rest, then.

389
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,308
Did you tell her? What did she say?

390
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,226
Of course she was very disappointed.

391
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:56,601
I don't feel too good about it.

392
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,439
Still, instead of telling her that
she was fired due to her bad acting...

393
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,367
...it's much better to tell her that
the movie was canceled. It hurts less.

394
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:04,230
That's true.

395
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,375
But I still feel sorry for her.

396
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:11,675
Jeongeun!

397
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:15,229
Why did you come out?
Are you going somewhere?

398
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,236
I just want to get some air.

399
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,153
Get some air?

400
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:19,932
Where?

401
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,213
I thought I'd visit the set.

402
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:24,542
What? The set?

403
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:26,379
Why? What for?

404
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:29,241
I practiced all night for days.

405
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:32,033
I feel so sad that it had to end.

406
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:35,424
What do you mean, sad?
Why would you go there?

407
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:36,956
It will only break your heart.

408
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,912
There's nobody there anyway.

409
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,153
I know.

410
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:45,310
But I don't think I can let it go
until I see the movie set for myself.

411
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,144
See you later.

412
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:51,310
What? Jeongeun. Jeongeun!

413
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:55,447
Kibong, what should do now?

414
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:57,310
Maybe you shouldn't have told her.

415
00:21:57,395 --> 00:22:00,580
What? Why, you bird-brain, knucklehead!

416
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,926
I'm the fool for listening
to an idiot like you!

417
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,830
Jeongeun, Jeongeun!

418
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,997
Wait a minute.

419
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,979
Why do you bother going
all the way there?

420
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:18,614
It'll only break your heart.
What's the point?

421
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:20,218
I know.

422
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:22,684
But how am I supposed to
deal with the frustration?

423
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:25,229
I just can't help but being sad.

424
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:29,320
I know. How could I not
understand that you're sad?

425
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:31,236
I know that feeling so well.

426
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:34,512
But still, let's not go to the set.

427
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:36,140
-Jungi.
-Yes?

428
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:37,495
You want to get a drink?

429
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:41,242
How can we drink in broad daylight?

430
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,935
Besides, you always fall asleep and
someone has to carry you home.

431
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,324
Then I'll just...

432
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,929
...take a visit to the set.

433
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:49,875
The set?

434
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,428
Jeongeun, wait a minute. Jeongeun, please!

435
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:57,766
Think Jungi. Think Jungi. Think.

436
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,278
Jeongeun, wait a minute.

437
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,302
Let's go. Let's go get a drink.

438
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,393
You said that you didn't want to
because I always fall asleep.

439
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,290
That's why we should drink.

440
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,142
Sometimes, it's okay to get some sleep
after getting hammered.

441
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:15,225
Let's go! Let's go get drunk!

442
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:18,312
Why are you here, Yuri?

443
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:22,279
I just wanted to come and watch.

444
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:24,171
Oh, I see.

445
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,930
Wooshik, what's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?

446
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,663
What? It's nothing.

447
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,138
I'm fine.

448
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:31,810
That's a relief.

449
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:33,050
Shall we begin?

450
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:34,013
All right.

451
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:36,176
You want to warm-up your throat first?

452
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,779
Why would I need a warm-up?
I'm not a beginner anymore.

453
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:42,649
I want to perform live
since we have an audience.

454
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:44,956
"Perform live"?

455
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:48,955
What are you doing?

456
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,833
I want to dance and sing
like I do in real events.

457
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,070
-Dance?
-Yes.

458
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:55,318
Since my singing's good,
I should practice with my dance.

459
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,424
Here I go!

460
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:58,659
Stop, stop! Han Suyeon!

461
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,970
Have you lost your mind?
You can't even sing standing still.

462
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:03,727
Forget about dancing!

463
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,885
You should try singing properly first.

464
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,502
That's right, you brat!
"Cheer up", my butt!

465
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:11,456
I get tired from watching you!

466
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,770
Who do you think you are?

467
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:14,964
Agreed!

468
00:25:15,235 --> 00:25:17,349
Wooshik! Yuri!

469
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,053
-What?
-What's wrong?

470
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:21,860
I'm done. Why are you guys quiet?

471
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,255
Oh, you're done already?

472
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:26,583
I was so into it that
I didn't even notice.

473
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:27,737
Exactly!

474
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:31,448
You were so shockingly...

475
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:33,106
...good.

476
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:36,217
I just fell so deep for the song.

477
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:39,458
I see. Do you have any other
comments, Wooshik?

478
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,134
What? No. No, I don't.

479
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:43,676
Really?

480
00:25:44,123 --> 00:25:45,644
Then I'll go to work now.

481
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:48,466
See?

482
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:50,617
Yeah.

483
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:56,416
Brother. How did you put up with this?

484
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,889
I don't know that either.

485
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,978
Sometimes, when I imagine her sing...

486
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:04,472
...my chest feels heavy...

487
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,517
...and I can't breathe...

488
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:11,295
Brother!

489
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:18,811
Doctor, what's wrong with him?

490
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:21,935
It's repressed anger.

491
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,068
It's something that
middle-aged women suffer...

492
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:27,158
...after tolerating their drunk husbands
for about 30 years.

493
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:29,436
How could this happen to a young man?

494
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,411
This just won't do.

495
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:34,151
Let's stop with the lessons.

496
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:36,433
No, I still have to do it.

497
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:40,466
It's an opportunity to get
closer to Suyeon.

498
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:43,447
Doctor, can you just prepare...

499
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:45,704
...the strongest medicine you have?

500
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,479
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

501
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:54,924
All right. She falls asleep
whenever she's drunk.

502
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,563
I'll make her fall asleep
by getting her drunk.

503
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,722
Then I'll go to the set.

504
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:03,112
Jeongeun, have a drink.

505
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:04,613
Here.

506
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:07,601
All right.

507
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,912
Drink it up...

508
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:13,051
...and forget about everything
after a good nap, okay?

509
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:13,969
Okay.

510
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,520
Aren't you going to drink?

511
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:19,437
Oh...

512
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:23,374
I have an upset stomach.
I'm fine, drink it up.

513
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:26,929
Then forget it. I don't want
to drink alone.

514
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,928
I'll just go to the set.

515
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:31,256
The set?

516
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:33,090
No, no.

517
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,957
Let's drink. Let's drink together.

518
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:36,555
Sit down.

519
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,382
Why are you so impatient?

520
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,763
Let's say cheers. Cheers.

521
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:54,105
Here. Have some more. There you go.

522
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:56,431
Again? Why are you in such a hurry?

523
00:27:56,516 --> 00:27:59,014
The faster you drink,
the better the booze.

524
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:02,369
All right, let's drink. Cheers.

525
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,402
-Slowly.
-What kind of medicine is that?

526
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,708
-Are you sick?
-You don't have to know.

527
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,330
I'm back.

528
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:18,597
Hey, you're back.

529
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,365
It's all right.

530
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,222
Why do you sound so depressed?

531
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:26,399
I got scolded again for
my singing at work today.

532
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:31,871
My boss told me not to hold
a microphone again from now on.

533
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,885
Wooshik, I want to stop
learning how to sing.

534
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,531
What? Why?

535
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:43,337
I want to look into
proper vocal academies.

536
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:45,206
What? A vocal academy?

537
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,155
Yeah.

538
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:50,174
I think it's better to learn
from more competent trainers.

539
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:51,098
What?

540
00:28:51,937 --> 00:28:53,412
So, are you saying that I didn't...

541
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:56,001
...teach you properly
because I'm incompetent?

542
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:58,620
I didn't mean it like that. But...

543
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:02,174
I can't say that you're not
partially responsible.

544
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:03,689
What did you say?

545
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:05,747
That being said...

546
00:29:05,832 --> 00:29:08,281
...I actually didn't like
your teaching method.

547
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:09,726
You don't have enough equipment...

548
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,807
...you're disorganized and
you make me do the same thing.

549
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:14,004
And you should scold me
if there is a problem.

550
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,775
How could I improve when
all you do is compliment me?

551
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:19,838
You're too nice,
and you have no of charisma.

552
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,871
Stop it! Hey, Han Suyeon!

553
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:25,449
What did you say? I'm the problem?

554
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,432
You didn't improve because
I didn't teach you properly?

555
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,016
Hey. Even if Freddie Mercury
comes back to life...

556
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,734
...he can't help you!
You're completely tone-deaf!

557
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:33,913
While teaching you...

558
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,793
...I got repressed anger disorder!

559
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:39,315
I got herbal medicine from
an oriental clinic, get it?

560
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:40,742
And what did you say?

561
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:42,876
How dare you babble on such nonsense?

562
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:45,323
This. This mouth of yours is the problem.

563
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:48,628
I ought to rip this off, darn it!

564
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:51,212
Wooshik! What the hell are you doing?

565
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,286
What? Why?

566
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:54,979
What has gotten into you?
Why are you acting like this?

567
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:56,608
What? Isn't this my imagination?

568
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:58,566
What imagination?

569
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,316
You crazy jerk!

570
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,821
No way. This can't be real.
This is my imagination.

571
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:05,081
It can't be...

572
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:08,827
Oh, gosh!

573
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,364
Su... Suyeon.

574
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:16,028
Yeah. I'm sorry that I'm tone-deaf.
I'm really sorry.

575
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,578
Oh, no. I didn't mean...

576
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,441
I really thought it was my imagination.

577
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:21,915
It was all my imagination until now.

578
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,488
So I thought I was imagining again.

579
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:27,251
So you've been cursing at me
in your mind all this time?

580
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:30,063
What? No, it's not that. It's...

581
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,383
Forget it!

582
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:35,267
Don't even talk to me again, you jerk!

583
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:37,594
Suyeon, I'm sorry.

584
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,884
Suyeon, I really thought
it was my imagination.

585
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:50,128
Why isn't she falling asleep today?

586
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:53,885
It's almost time for the shoot.
I'm about to lose it!

587
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:55,991
I don't have a choice.

588
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,618
It's time for the last resort.

589
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,254
Hey, Jeongeun. Drink.

590
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:23,970
Hey. Isn't this way too much?

591
00:31:24,054 --> 00:31:26,681
We should drink on a day like this.

592
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:27,894
Let's go!

593
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,155
Let's drink until the end!

594
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:33,780
Okay, let's go!

595
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:48,749
Bingo. She fell asleep.

596
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,576
Wait, I should make a call.

597
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,116
Hey, Kibong?

598
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:02,136
I'm at the Twin's Bar.

599
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,477
Jeongeun got drunk and she fell asleep.

600
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,147
I have to go to the shoot.

601
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:09,964
Can you come and take her home?

602
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:13,451
Okay. Okay, thanks.

603
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,761
Jungi, where are you going?

604
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:24,843
I'm not going anywhere.

605
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,245
Where would I go?

606
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:31,176
Get back over here.
We should have another drink.

607
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:34,903
Let's go!

608
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:38,123
Let's go one more time!

609
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,533
Okay.

610
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:47,778
She really fell asleep.

611
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,115
Are you okay?

612
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,182
Quiet auntie.

613
00:32:57,164 --> 00:33:01,035
My friend will come and pick her up.

614
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,959
You must not wake her up.

615
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,208
I have to go.

616
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:07,978
I have to go for the shoot.

617
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,306
All right. Is everyone ready?

618
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,859
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

619
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:20,520
Jungi, I like that look in your eyes.

620
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,906
-Thank you.
-Wow.

621
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:25,661
You even sound like you're possessed.

622
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:28,107
Okay, then. Let's begin shooting.

623
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,879
-Okay.
-Okay.

624
00:33:32,117 --> 00:33:34,651
Ready, action!

625
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:37,731
What is your name?

626
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:45,223
Park Yido...!

627
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:47,869
Park Yido.

628
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,507
So it was you.

629
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,696
In the name of the Lord...

630
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:55,166
...I command you to leave
this man's body at once!

631
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,211
Hyungcheol!

632
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,977
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked.

633
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,185
This isn't enough.

634
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:21,116
-Maria, the holy water.
-Yes, Father.

635
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:27,607
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit...

636
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,601
...begone, Satan!

637
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:42,878
Cut!

638
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,313
Give him a hand.

639
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:48,620
That was some killer acting.

640
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:51,254
-Amazing.
-I got goosebumps.

641
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:55,460
In my 30 years as a director,
I've never seen such passionate acting.

642
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:56,786
Thank you.

643
00:34:57,176 --> 00:35:00,402
Jungi, you will be the main character
of my next movie.

644
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,970
The main character?

645
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,669
Thank you!

646
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:08,591
Can I see that act one more time?

647
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:09,569
Again?

648
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:12,969
Sure. I'll show you.

649
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,581
The main character.

650
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,140
Kibong.

651
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:31,392
Auntie?

652
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,277
Why are you here?

653
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:34,672
You told me to come.

654
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:36,983
Really? No, I didn't.

655
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:39,450
I never said that.

656
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,949
Can you wait?

657
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:45,243
I'm going to show
my acting to the director.

658
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:58,559
Auntie, how long has he been like this?

659
00:35:58,643 --> 00:36:01,152
He's been like this ever since
he collapsed on his way out.

660
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:05,697
Park Yido...!

661
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,183
Darn it.

662
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:13,572
What the hell is he doing?

663
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:15,660
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked.

664
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:17,883
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked.

665
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:20,456
What's she babbling about?

666
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,237
Seriously, this is humiliating.

667
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:29,090
Are you all right?
You must've been shocked?

668
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:35,191
You okay? Were you shocked?

669
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:40,310
Darn it.

670
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:43,100
Hey, until when are you
going to be like this?

671
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:44,598
No one told you to get
boozed up like that.

672
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:48,300
Jeongeun kept insisting to go to the set.
What was I supposed to do?

673
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,431
Oh well, I guess it's fine
since her feelings aren't hurt.

674
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:55,229
You care so much about Jeongeun.

675
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,049
By the way, did you apologize to Suyeon?

676
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,457
No, not yet.

677
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,310
She won't talk to me.
What can I do?

678
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:02,986
Bad singing's not a federal crime.

679
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:05,356
Why did you humiliate her like that?

680
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,525
Do you dislike Suyeon that much?

681
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,193
Why are you always so mean to her?

682
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:10,206
When was I mean to her?

683
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,721
Come on. You're mean to her everyday.

684
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:15,766
This chump disliked idea of her
moving in right from the start.

685
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:16,896
Yes, exactly.

686
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:18,671
You shouldn't be mean
to her when she's...

687
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:20,492
...already troubled because
of her dad's bankruptcy.

688
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:21,838
What did I do?

689
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:23,141
I'm back.

690
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,191
Hey, Suyeon. Welcome back.

691
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:34,822
Suyeon, I'm sorry about yesterday.

692
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:36,542
Can you stop being mad at me?

693
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:39,749
Forget it. I'm tired.
I'm going to my room.

694
00:37:40,116 --> 00:37:42,312
Hey, I said I'm sorry.

695
00:37:42,397 --> 00:37:44,015
Can you please settle down already?

696
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:45,908
It's not because of you.

697
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:48,826
Then what? Tell me what the problem is.

698
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,354
Tell me.

699
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,104
I got fired.

700
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:57,208
I'm so upset right now.
Why are you yelling at me, jerk!

701
00:37:57,815 --> 00:37:59,544
Seriously.

702
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,481
No, it's not... I was just trying to...

703
00:38:04,864 --> 00:38:06,632
That jerk!

704
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:10,321
Hey jerk! Are you human or demon?

705
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:12,874
You're worse than a demon, you jerk!

706
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,924
-No, I was just...
-You're a jerk!

707
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:16,843
No, the thing is... I...

708
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,430
Oh gosh, kill me already.

709
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,407
-Good job, Kibong.
-Good work.

710
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:28,907
Hey, Kibong.

711
00:38:30,344 --> 00:38:33,311
It must've been very disappointing
to fail the try out for the first team.

712
00:38:34,317 --> 00:38:36,052
-No, sir.
-Come on.

713
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,413
You know, the first team's coach was...

714
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,898
...very torn until
the end because of you.

715
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:45,108
He said your ball power is good,
but your pitches are too simple.

716
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:48,801
It'd be perfect if you could
learn the forkball.

717
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:49,953
The forkball?

718
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,383
Oh, boy. What should we have for lunch?

719
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:55,500
What? Lunch? Excuse me.

720
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,126
How could you think about food
after making Suyeon cry like that?

721
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:03,009
Anyway, you'd better apologize
to Suyeon again today.

722
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,768
-Okay, demon?
-Jeez, I got it.

723
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:07,655
-I'll be back.
-Where are you going?

724
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:08,877
It's none of your business.

725
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:12,479
What are you doing, Yuri?

726
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:17,056
I've had enough fun.

727
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,182
So I should start working again.

728
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:22,193
Work? Are you going back
to the hotel kitchen?

729
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,729
Do I look crazy?
I'll never work there again.

730
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:26,467
No matter how hard I work...

731
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:29,392
...they belittle and disrespect me
because I never studied abroad.

732
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:31,529
I'm going to open up my own restaurant.

733
00:39:31,614 --> 00:39:33,037
I already came up with a name.

734
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,988
"Yuri's Kitchen." Isn't it awesome?

735
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,474
Do you have money to do that?

736
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:39,495
No, I'll start saving now.

737
00:39:39,808 --> 00:39:43,504
For the rent deposit and other things,
50 million won should be enough.

738
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,911
50 million won? How much
have you saved up?

739
00:39:45,995 --> 00:39:47,072
3,800 won.

740
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:50,143
So I just need to save 49,996,200 won.

741
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:52,069
Gosh, I knew it.

742
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:55,938
So I'd like to ask you...

743
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:58,618
...to invest in my business
if you have any extra money.

744
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:00,365
Extra money?

745
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:01,933
I don't even have money to eat.

746
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,109
Is that so?

747
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:07,406
Gosh, where am I going
to get all that money?

748
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:12,452
Where can I find a dumb, rich fool?

749
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,680
Whose phone is that?

750
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:17,516
I think this is Kibong's phone.

751
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:20,664
Really?

752
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,292
Then I should drop this off for him.

753
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:26,983
-Come on, Byungcheol.
-Gosh.

754
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,686
You want me to teach you the forkball?

755
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:32,055
Yes, you throw the best forkball in Korea.

756
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,884
Well, that is true.

757
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,401
Hey, not everyone can do it.

758
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,462
Come on, don't laugh at me.

759
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:44,653
I'm not laughing at you.
I'm just think it's absurd.

760
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:47,063
You're doing it again!

761
00:40:47,147 --> 00:40:48,462
Stop laughing at me already.

762
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,602
Teach me how to throw
the forkball, please?

763
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:52,313
-No. No.
-Please, Byungcheol.

764
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:53,363
Kibong!

765
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:56,216
Hey, Yuri.

766
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:04,790
-What brings you here?
-You left your phone.

767
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,442
So I brought it for you. Here.

768
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,624
Oh, I see.

769
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:09,734
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

770
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:12,828
22,000 won for the trouble.
Including the surtax.

771
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:15,339
For the trouble? Surtax?

772
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:19,994
Hey, surtax is added
even on candy. Pay me.

773
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,084
This is ridiculous. Take it back, then.

774
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:24,882
Oh, really? Is this how you'll play it?

775
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,194
You will regret this.

776
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:28,955
Regret what? What are you going to do?

777
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,160
The guys don't seem to know
that you had your first kiss with me.

778
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:34,911
Shall I go ahead and tell everyone?

779
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:37,516
If you'd like, I can also post
it on your team's website.

780
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:41,250
Wait, Yuri. Okay, I'll give it to you.

781
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:44,749
But you have to keep it a secret, okay?

782
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:46,471
You should've played nice from the get-go.

783
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:50,432
Okay! Now, I just need
to save 49,974,200 won.

784
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,411
Thank you.

785
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:55,980
Seriously, that psycho...

786
00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:58,500
-Who is she?
-What?

787
00:41:59,904 --> 00:42:01,529
She's my buddy's sister.

788
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:02,920
Oh.

789
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,762
Is that so?

790
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,062
What? A blind date?

791
00:42:09,149 --> 00:42:11,065
No thanks. I don't have time for that.

792
00:42:11,149 --> 00:42:13,562
Come on. Please go on
the blind date just this once.

793
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:17,034
Byungcheol would only teach me
the forkball if I set you up with him.

794
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:20,761
Come on. I have to learn that
to make the first team.

795
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,513
Gosh, cut it out. I have no time.

796
00:42:23,597 --> 00:42:25,687
I need to earn money
to open Yuri's Kitchen.

797
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:28,780
Money? Then I'll give you 50,000 won.

798
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:30,934
Who do you think you're dealing with?

799
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,739
100,000 won. No surtax.

800
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:35,997
Okay, deal. So you'll do it, right?

801
00:42:36,082 --> 00:42:37,844
I'll go ahead and arrange
the blind date, then.

802
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:39,379
Okay.

803
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:42,555
Okay! Now, I just need
to save 49,874,200 won.

804
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,045
Goodness, looks like you're
on a roll making money.

805
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:46,851
What?

806
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,933
I'm back.

807
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:50,822
Where's Suyeon?

808
00:42:50,906 --> 00:42:54,060
Beats me. She didn't eat all day
and she won't come out of her room.

809
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:55,642
Oh, what's that cake for?

810
00:42:55,726 --> 00:42:57,408
Get lost. It's not for you.

811
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:07,073
Hey, Suyeon. What are you doing?

812
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:09,151
I bought...

813
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,722
...this cheesecake for you. Have some.

814
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:13,991
You like this cake.

815
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:17,695
Thanks, but I don't have
an appetite right now.

816
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,697
Come on, cheer up.

817
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:22,300
It's just a part-time job.
Don't be like that.

818
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:26,616
I just feel like a pathetic fool.

819
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:28,406
What do you mean, pathetic?

820
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:32,018
I'm no good at housework.

821
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:35,022
I can't keep a job because
I keep making mistakes.

822
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:38,245
I can't do anything right.

823
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:44,038
Jungi, I used to think that I
was very competent and bright.

824
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,253
But now I feel like a complete idiot.

825
00:43:50,646 --> 00:43:52,643
How did I end up like this?

826
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:57,963
I feel like such a fool
that it's driving me crazy.

827
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:04,742
And my dad isn't even around.
I feel so lonely and sad.

828
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:12,217
Guys, what should we do?
It seems like Suyeon's really upset.

829
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:13,494
I know.

830
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:16,744
Hey, is there anything
we can do to cheer her up?

831
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:18,923
I thought it over...

832
00:44:19,467 --> 00:44:20,398
...and I have a great idea.

833
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:21,742
A great idea? What is it?

834
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:25,077
I should be Suyeon's boyfriend.

835
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,621
What? Boyfriend?

836
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,502
What the hell are you saying?

837
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:29,846
What kind of solution is that?

838
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:31,715
Hey, think about it.

839
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,802
Having a trustworthy boyfriend like me
who can be as considerate like her dad...

840
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:38,383
....will help her feel
less sad and lonely, right?

841
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:43,350
So you'll be her boyfriend since
she's having a hard time, is that it?

842
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:46,250
Yeah. It's the least I can
do for my first love.

843
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:47,602
That doesn't make any sense.

844
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,983
Do you like Suyeon?

845
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:53,784
No, but I'm going to start
liking her again from now on.

846
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:55,608
What? No. No way.

847
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,695
What? Who are you to decide?

848
00:44:57,881 --> 00:45:01,132
Why do you care if I like her or not?

849
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,441
What? Well, you know...

850
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:06,420
...it's because you're too good for her.

851
00:45:06,505 --> 00:45:08,355
-What?
-You're good looking...

852
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,185
...nice and loyal.

853
00:45:12,984 --> 00:45:14,779
-And you're fit.
-Huh, what?

854
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:18,060
And not only that, you're sexy.

855
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:20,785
Why would you go out with
someone like Suyeon?

856
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:24,599
-Right, Kibong?
-I'm not sure about that.

857
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:25,705
I'm not sure either.

858
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,795
But I'm worried if we butt in...

859
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:30,357
...we might end up making
things worse for Suyeon.

860
00:45:30,442 --> 00:45:31,275
You think so?

861
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:33,546
Then let's just forget it.

862
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,739
Yeah, good thinking.

863
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:42,403
Okay, don't worry.

864
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:45,403
I'll help you learn the forkball
or spoonball or whatever.

865
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:46,320
Bye.

866
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,166
Gosh, he's so annoying.

867
00:45:49,311 --> 00:45:50,848
So who's the chump I'm meeting?

868
00:45:52,322 --> 00:45:53,851
Yuri, over here!

869
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,950
Oh my, hello.

870
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,120
Wow. He's handsome and tall.

871
00:46:02,205 --> 00:46:04,384
He's totally my type.

872
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:09,734
Oh, so your hobby is voluntary work.

873
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,594
I'm the kind of person
who can't walk by...

874
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:15,023
...when I see people in need of help.

875
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,802
Oh, I see.

876
00:46:16,913 --> 00:46:20,708
By the way, Kibong told
me that you're a chef.

877
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:21,626
Yes.

878
00:46:22,034 --> 00:46:26,201
I'm the happiest woman
in the world when I cook.

879
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:30,757
What kind of dish can you cook?

880
00:46:30,975 --> 00:46:31,808
Korean food?

881
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:34,583
Western food? Chinese food? Japanese food?

882
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:35,732
Or...

883
00:46:36,454 --> 00:46:37,704
...cutie pies?

884
00:46:43,223 --> 00:46:46,562
What? What's up with his laughter?

885
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,163
It was a joke. Wasn't it funny?

886
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:54,593
I laughed all night
when I thought of this joke.

887
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:57,686
It still cracks me up.

888
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:59,695
What in the world? What is that laugh?

889
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:01,128
Cutie pies.

890
00:47:01,213 --> 00:47:03,318
What is this? What's wrong with this guy?

891
00:47:05,384 --> 00:47:06,891
What the devil? What the hell?

892
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:10,984
-Kook Kibong!
-Hey, you're back.

893
00:47:11,068 --> 00:47:13,059
He told me that he really likes you.

894
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:14,562
Shut up! Are you crazy?

895
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:16,617
Why, you didn't like him?

896
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:17,639
Of course!

897
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:20,471
What kind of man laughs like that?

898
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:23,126
I can't even imitate it.

899
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,444
Oh, that?

900
00:47:24,724 --> 00:47:26,920
He does have a unique laugh.

901
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:29,998
Whatever. Just know that
I'm not going see him again.

902
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,672
-Understood?
-Yuri!

903
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,898
I'm begging you.

904
00:47:34,078 --> 00:47:35,869
I must learn how to throw the forkball.

905
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,079
I really have to go up
to the first team this time.

906
00:47:39,163 --> 00:47:41,759
Stop it. You're making me feel bad.

907
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:47,237
Fine. Then give me 50,000 won
more for emotional distress.

908
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:48,974
Otherwise there's no deal.

909
00:47:49,122 --> 00:47:50,838
Okay, I'll give it to you.

910
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,580
Thanks, Yuri.

911
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:54,888
Just get off of me!

912
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:56,782
You're not a friend. You're an enemy.

913
00:47:57,738 --> 00:47:59,105
Thanks, Yuri. Thanks so much.

914
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,464
Hey Yuri, how was the blind date?

915
00:48:01,786 --> 00:48:03,147
-What's up with her?
-It's nothing.

916
00:48:03,878 --> 00:48:04,711
Where's Jungi?

917
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:07,254
Jungi? He went out on a date with Suyeon.

918
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:09,132
What? Jungi and Suyeon are on a date?

919
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:13,249
Yes. He said he can't let
Suyeon be lonely anymore.

920
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:15,199
So he's going to tell her
how he feels about her.

921
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:17,422
What? That punk!

922
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:21,975
-Hey.
-Where did they go? Where!

923
00:48:23,558 --> 00:48:26,171
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

924
00:48:31,848 --> 00:48:33,043
This is delicious.

925
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,951
-Thanks, Jungi.
-Don't mention it.

926
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:39,702
So, how are you now? Feeling better?

927
00:48:39,786 --> 00:48:42,115
Yes, thanks to you.

928
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,566
That's good.

929
00:48:45,164 --> 00:48:46,939
Just tell me if there's
anything you want to do.

930
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,260
-I'll do it all for you.
-Anything?

931
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:53,794
It's been frustrating
so I wanted to see the beach.

932
00:48:53,879 --> 00:48:54,835
Let's go to the beach!

933
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,751
No, it's okay. I was just saying.

934
00:48:56,835 --> 00:48:57,668
No?

935
00:48:58,651 --> 00:48:59,904
-Really?
-Yes.

936
00:49:03,515 --> 00:49:05,253
You're a bit strange today.

937
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:06,983
Why are you so nice to me?

938
00:49:07,396 --> 00:49:10,653
-Did you do something wrong?
-No, of course not.

939
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:16,663
Actually, I have something
that I want to tell you.

940
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:17,581
You do?

941
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:19,382
What is it?

942
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:21,158
Well, it's...

943
00:49:22,144 --> 00:49:23,049
Hey, Suyeon.

944
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:25,370
I...

945
00:49:25,454 --> 00:49:27,702
-Jungi!
-Oh my gosh!

946
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:28,969
Goodness!

947
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:34,938
Wooshik, what brings you here?

948
00:49:35,454 --> 00:49:37,632
You... told me...

949
00:49:37,796 --> 00:49:39,291
...to apologize to Suyeon officially.

950
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,432
Yeah, I did tell you that.

951
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:44,831
Suyeon. I'm sorry for getting angry...

952
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,452
...when I was teaching you how to sing.

953
00:49:47,587 --> 00:49:51,135
And I'm sorry for yelling at you
again when you got fired.

954
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:52,964
I mean it.

955
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:56,807
Oh, okay.

956
00:49:57,144 --> 00:49:58,668
She said okay. Off you go now.

957
00:49:58,752 --> 00:50:00,173
-I'm not done yet.
-What?

958
00:50:00,607 --> 00:50:01,440
Suyeon.

959
00:50:02,007 --> 00:50:03,061
I'm sorry.

960
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:04,802
I'm sorry.

961
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:06,599
I'm sorry.

962
00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:08,057
I'm sorry.

963
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:09,918
I'm sorry.

964
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:12,812
That's enough. Just go.

965
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:13,823
I'm sorry.

966
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:15,241
I'm sorry.

967
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:17,296
I'm sorry.

968
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:20,484
I'm sorry.

969
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:23,654
-Say what?
-I'm sorry.

970
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:25,207
They all mean I'm sorry.

971
00:50:26,726 --> 00:50:29,275
Wooshik, what do you think you're doing?

972
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,407
Who makes apologies
in 50 different languages?

973
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:34,824
I missed my chance of asking
Suyeon out because of you.

974
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,328
You told me to apologize.
So I came up with a sincere apology.

975
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:40,192
Are you kidding me?

976
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,280
Something's fishy about this guy.

977
00:50:43,365 --> 00:50:46,422
You were dead set against it yesterday
when I said I wanted to date Suyeon.

978
00:50:46,506 --> 00:50:48,628
And today, you followed us
to the wine bar.

979
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:52,461
Hey, do you like Suyeon?

980
00:50:52,781 --> 00:50:54,982
-What?
-Hey, how does that make sense?

981
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:56,808
Don't you know how
Wooshik dislikes Suyeon?

982
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:00,213
Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

983
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,748
Then why did you do that?

984
00:51:01,832 --> 00:51:03,033
What's your reason?

985
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:06,070
What reason? I just went
there to apologize.

986
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,164
Something's up.

987
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:13,773
He's definitely hiding something.

988
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:21,124
It's so strange.

989
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,048
Something's up with Wooshik for sure.

990
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:28,719
What? Jungi wants to ask Suyeon out?

991
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:31,158
-But why?
-I don't know.

992
00:51:31,243 --> 00:51:32,453
What should I do now, Yuri?

993
00:51:32,538 --> 00:51:34,082
What else can you do?

994
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:37,428
Just tell Jungi the truth
about how you feel.

995
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:44,450
But, do you think Jungi would understand?

996
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,404
It's not a crime to like someone.

997
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:48,968
I know, but...

998
00:51:49,053 --> 00:51:51,266
...what if our friendship gets ruined?

999
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:52,925
So you're just going to give up?

1000
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,479
Until when are you going
to keep this a secret?

1001
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:59,414
Jungi will eventually
find out about how you feel.

1002
00:51:59,643 --> 00:52:01,800
The sooner he knows, the better.

1003
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:05,376
So, just tell Jungi about
how you really feel.

1004
00:52:05,683 --> 00:52:08,058
That you had feelings first.

1005
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:10,425
That you had love in your heart...

1006
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,517
...since high school.

1007
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:16,400
And that you'll continue to feel
this way forever and ever.

1008
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:33,315
What's wrong? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

1009
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,441
Kibong... I just found out that...

1010
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:39,462
...Wooshik...

1011
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:43,020
...likes me.

1012
00:52:43,105 --> 00:52:46,194
-What?
-He loved me since high school...

1013
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,327
And he'll continue to love
me forever and ever.

1014
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:52,775
What on earth are you talking about?

1015
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:56,199
I clearly heard Yuri and Wooshik
talking with my own two ears.

1016
00:52:56,284 --> 00:52:58,384
You must have heard wrong.
That's just ridiculous.

1017
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,216
I thought so too at first.

1018
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,500
But now that I thought about it,
it actually makes sense.

1019
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:05,303
Do you remember what
Wooshik said yesterday?

1020
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:07,215
I think you are too good for her.

1021
00:53:08,248 --> 00:53:12,786
You're good looking, nice and loyal.

1022
00:53:14,502 --> 00:53:17,150
And you're fit. And not only that...

1023
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:19,340
...you're even sexy.

1024
00:53:19,703 --> 00:53:22,399
Why would you go out with
someone like Suyeon?

1025
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:24,935
Yeah, it was a little strange but...

1026
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:27,397
But still, that's impossible.

1027
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:31,296
Then what about him showing up
at the wine bar and ruining my plan?

1028
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,425
How do you explain that?

1029
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,360
Do you think he came because of Suyeon?

1030
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,385
No, that can't be. He can't stand Suyeon.

1031
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:37,968
Exactly!

1032
00:53:38,317 --> 00:53:40,851
He came because of me.

1033
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:43,552
Because he loves me.

1034
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,843
Love...?

1035
00:53:44,927 --> 00:53:47,563
That's why he was so
against Suyeon moving in.

1036
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,141
That's why he picked on her all the time.

1037
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:54,182
Because he didn't want
to lose me to Suyeon.

1038
00:53:54,842 --> 00:53:55,675
What do you think?

1039
00:53:56,094 --> 00:53:59,114
It all makes perfect sense
now, doesn't it?

1040
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,960
It does. How could this happen?

1041
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:06,546
Wooshik.

1042
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,547
Jungi, I need to tell you something.

1043
00:54:10,631 --> 00:54:12,439
No! Don't.

1044
00:54:12,855 --> 00:54:13,794
Just don't say anything.

1045
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:16,320
-What's the matter with you?
-Just don't say anything.

1046
00:54:16,718 --> 00:54:18,034
I have nothing to say to you.

1047
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,451
Nothing!

1048
00:54:23,081 --> 00:54:24,775
Hey, what's gotten into him?

1049
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:27,598
I'm not sure.

1050
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:31,369
How is this place, Yuri? Do you like it?

1051
00:54:31,454 --> 00:54:32,774
Yes.

1052
00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:35,723
I reserved the table by the windows.

1053
00:54:35,808 --> 00:54:37,384
Why did you ask to sit in the corner?

1054
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:39,398
It's all because of you.

1055
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:42,760
Because you bray like a donkey
when there's people around.

1056
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,158
It's just...

1057
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:49,347
...I like the corner seat.

1058
00:54:49,432 --> 00:54:51,688
Oh, I see.

1059
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:54,705
Let's decide what to eat first.

1060
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:56,300
Sure.

1061
00:54:56,464 --> 00:54:58,881
The mushroom pasta here is pretty good.

1062
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,562
Oh yeah. Yuri...

1063
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:03,358
...do you know which vegetable goes
best with jacket potatoes?

1064
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:06,270
No. What?

1065
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,327
Button mushrooms.

1066
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,722
Jeez, he's at it again.

1067
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:25,242
Then, do you know the gun
that uses salt as bullets?

1068
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,915
A salt-rifle!

1069
00:55:29,297 --> 00:55:31,183
A salt-rifle.

1070
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:36,433
Byungcheol!

1071
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:40,795
Oh my gosh. What's wrong, Yuri?

1072
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,592
I'm so sorry to tell you this, but...

1073
00:55:45,351 --> 00:55:47,245
...can you please stop laughing?

1074
00:55:47,816 --> 00:55:50,506
My laugh sounds a bit unique, right?

1075
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,266
But I've been like this since I was born.

1076
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,556
I just can't seem to fix it. I'm sorry.

1077
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,043
No, it's okay.

1078
00:55:57,128 --> 00:56:01,568
I'd appreciate it if you
could tone it down a little.

1079
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:02,600
From now on...

1080
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:05,600
...I'll do my best to resist myself
from laughing when I'm with you.

1081
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:08,031
Okay... Thank you.

1082
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,775
No one's home, right?

1083
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:14,164
All right.

1084
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,875
I'll just grab my clothes and go
before I run into Wooshik.

1085
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,081
Just my clothes.

1086
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,147
-Hey, Jungi.
-Oh, jeez!

1087
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,101
-Wooshik.
-Why are you so startled?

1088
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,166
Jungi, there's something
I need to tell you.

1089
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,778
Why don't we go somewhere
quiet and have a drink?

1090
00:56:33,863 --> 00:56:34,696
A drink?

1091
00:56:35,444 --> 00:56:36,997
No! I quit drinking.

1092
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:38,964
Really? Then should we have
a cup of coffee?

1093
00:56:39,049 --> 00:56:39,882
Coffee?

1094
00:56:40,217 --> 00:56:41,814
No, I quit coffee!

1095
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:42,855
You quit coffee?

1096
00:56:43,294 --> 00:56:44,942
Fine, let's just talk here.

1097
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:45,860
Talk?

1098
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:47,741
No! I quit talking!

1099
00:56:47,826 --> 00:56:48,751
What do you mean?

1100
00:56:48,836 --> 00:56:49,931
This is really important.

1101
00:56:50,015 --> 00:56:51,937
I told you I quit talking.

1102
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:54,245
Don't come. Don't come near me.

1103
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,558
I just need a minute to talk.

1104
00:56:55,642 --> 00:56:56,842
-Don't come.
-What's your problem?

1105
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:57,842
Don't say anything.

1106
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,916
Darn it!

1107
00:57:08,168 --> 00:57:09,568
What do you think you're doing?

1108
00:57:09,652 --> 00:57:11,738
What? I'm doing this because of you.

1109
00:57:11,823 --> 00:57:13,856
Wooshik, what has gotten into you?

1110
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,766
Why are you doing this to me?

1111
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,790
I'm just your friend. That's all.

1112
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,750
What? What are you talking about?

1113
00:57:20,835 --> 00:57:22,906
I know everything!

1114
00:57:24,682 --> 00:57:26,624
You love me.

1115
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,846
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

1116
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:32,019
What?

1117
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:34,680
What? So you're saying...

1118
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:37,646
...the person you like isn't me,
but it's Suyeon?

1119
00:57:37,731 --> 00:57:39,683
Quiet.

1120
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:41,600
Well yeah, it just happened.

1121
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:43,220
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

1122
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:46,208
It's cool. As long as it's not me.

1123
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:48,485
I don't care as long as
it's not me, Wooshik.

1124
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,413
Jeez! What's wrong with you?

1125
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:51,748
You have to keep this secret.

1126
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,498
I know, I know.

1127
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:57,331
From now on, I'll root for
you and Suyeon all the way.

1128
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,633
Don't you worry about a thing.

1129
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:08,260
How was the food? Did you enjoy it?

1130
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:11,625
Yes, it was delicious.
And this place has a good vibe too.

1131
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,492
I'm glad.

1132
00:58:13,845 --> 00:58:15,783
Let's go see a movie tomorrow.

1133
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,311
I'll make the reservation.

1134
00:58:17,876 --> 00:58:18,709
Okay.

1135
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:23,866
Gosh, I'm so happy now
that he's not laughing.

1136
00:58:23,982 --> 00:58:26,918
He's good looking and well-mannered.

1137
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,246
Then, shall we go now?

1138
00:58:29,331 --> 00:58:30,217
Okay.

1139
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:35,089
Byungcheol.

1140
00:58:36,787 --> 00:58:38,531
Dad, Mom.

1141
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,816
Byungeun.

1142
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,322
It's nice to meet you.

1143
00:58:48,287 --> 00:58:51,497
You're much prettier than
from what I heard from Byungcheol.

1144
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:52,774
Thank you.

1145
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:54,928
Is my brother treating you well?

1146
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:58,118
All he does is train, so he's
probably not so great at dating.

1147
00:58:58,203 --> 00:58:59,306
What are you talking about?

1148
00:58:59,395 --> 00:59:01,881
I treat Yuri like a real princess.

1149
00:59:01,966 --> 00:59:02,818
Right?

1150
00:59:02,926 --> 00:59:05,756
What? Oh, yes.

1151
00:59:06,364 --> 00:59:09,279
Anyway, I hope you see
each other for a long time.

1152
00:59:10,475 --> 00:59:14,447
By the way, what do you call
a single soy in English?

1153
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:15,365
Pardon?

1154
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:20,266
-I'm not sure.
-It's Won Bin.

1155
00:59:21,915 --> 00:59:23,035
Won Bin?

1156
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:30,467
What now? What is wrong with this man?

1157
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:37,274
What a shock. The father and son
laugh the same way!

1158
00:59:37,696 --> 00:59:40,461
What? How can a single soy be Won Bin?

1159
00:59:40,546 --> 00:59:41,759
Mom, come on.

1160
00:59:41,843 --> 00:59:45,502
The number 1 in English is "one,"
and soy in English is "bean."

1161
00:59:45,587 --> 00:59:48,999
And "one bean" sounds like Won Bin.

1162
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,586
So that's why it's Won Bin?

1163
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:53,838
Mom!

1164
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:56,406
I told you not to laugh like that.

1165
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:59,596
You're going to crack me up too!

1166
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,999
What kind of family is this?

1167
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,713
"Seeking Female Part-timer"

1168
01:00:25,381 --> 01:00:26,716
I'm sorry.

1169
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:29,566
We can't hire you because
you don't have enough experience.

1170
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:37,680
Wooshik.

1171
01:00:40,573 --> 01:00:41,738
Suyeon, get in.

1172
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:44,448
What? Why?

1173
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:47,529
I want to take you somewhere.
Hurry up and get in.

1174
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:48,711
Go where?

1175
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:56,540
Forget about money.

1176
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,001
I won't see that guy again even for
one million, no ten million won.

1177
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:03,292
I'm going to tell Kibong and
break up with him right away.

1178
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,357
"Donkey"

1179
01:01:40,312 --> 01:01:41,269
Hello?

1180
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,855
Yuri, why weren't you answering my calls?

1181
01:01:44,062 --> 01:01:46,801
Did I make a mistake today?

1182
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:47,852
Pardon?

1183
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:51,473
No, you didn't make any mistake.

1184
01:01:51,558 --> 01:01:53,698
I'll see you tomorrow night
at the movies.

1185
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:55,098
Okay.

1186
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:11,934
What are you doing?

1187
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,015
Kibong, if you don't make
the first team this time...

1188
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,500
...you're dead meat! Got it?

1189
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:19,913
I hate you.

1190
01:02:22,853 --> 01:02:23,686
What?

1191
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,610
Gosh, that psycho!

1192
01:02:27,628 --> 01:02:29,099
Oh, for crying out loud!

1193
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,496
I'm back.

1194
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:33,579
Hey, you're back.

1195
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,336
How did the audition go?

1196
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:37,020
Well, I tried my best.

1197
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,595
Jungi, why did you do that?

1198
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,513
Do what?

1199
01:02:41,598 --> 01:02:43,769
I ran into the assistant director...

1200
01:02:44,004 --> 01:02:46,268
...and he told me that our movie
was never canceled.

1201
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:49,022
Oh, the thing is...

1202
01:02:49,107 --> 01:02:51,118
I heard that I was fired
because of my bad acting.

1203
01:02:51,596 --> 01:02:53,334
Why did you lie to me?

1204
01:02:54,193 --> 01:02:55,122
Well...

1205
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:58,634
...I didn't want you to get hurt.

1206
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,043
I was worried you might give up again.

1207
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:02,644
Why would I give up?

1208
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:04,414
I'll never give up again.

1209
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:06,794
You should've gone to the set.

1210
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,688
And now you're in this mess because of me.

1211
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:10,841
It's okay.

1212
01:03:10,926 --> 01:03:13,567
We're in this together until the end.

1213
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:16,842
Thanks.

1214
01:03:17,883 --> 01:03:19,679
I'm hungry too. Give me
some of that ramyeon.

1215
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:21,569
Forget it. Go make your own.

1216
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:23,779
You just said we're in this
together until the end.

1217
01:03:23,864 --> 01:03:25,605
Not when it comes to Ramyeon, so go away.

1218
01:03:25,689 --> 01:03:27,815
-Don't be silly.
-Give me a bite.

1219
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:30,468
What are you doing?

1220
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:31,613
That's hot.

1221
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:37,716
It's been so long since
I came to the beach.

1222
01:03:38,175 --> 01:03:39,355
It's so nice.

1223
01:03:40,144 --> 01:03:42,503
Is this where you wanted to come?

1224
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:45,627
Yeah, I felt like going
to the beach all of a sudden.

1225
01:03:45,819 --> 01:03:47,391
I didn't feel like coming alone though.

1226
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:48,569
Really?

1227
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:52,045
I also wanted to come to the beach
because I've been feeling down.

1228
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:53,235
Really?

1229
01:03:54,512 --> 01:03:57,173
What a coincidence. I can't believe it.

1230
01:03:58,442 --> 01:04:01,885
Anyway, thanks to you
I get to see the beach.

1231
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:03,603
No problem.

1232
01:04:03,688 --> 01:04:04,653
But, Suyeon...

1233
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:07,615
...do you know what "stupid"
stands for in Korean?

1234
01:04:07,699 --> 01:04:08,532
Stupid?

1235
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,294
"Treasure of the Ocean"?

1236
01:04:11,378 --> 01:04:12,983
Oh? You do know.

1237
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:16,617
Wow, Suyeon. I thought you
were stupid, but you're not.

1238
01:04:16,701 --> 01:04:18,200
What are you suddenly talking about?

1239
01:04:18,285 --> 01:04:21,599
You said you've been
feeling like a fool lately.

1240
01:04:21,743 --> 01:04:23,196
That you've become an idiot.

1241
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:25,605
But you're not stupid at all
from what I can tell.

1242
01:04:26,055 --> 01:04:27,693
So what if you suck at housework?

1243
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:30,547
And so what if you get fired
because you made a mistake?

1244
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:32,802
It was the first time for you.

1245
01:04:32,986 --> 01:04:36,039
That's not stupid.

1246
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,720
It's called "trial and error".

1247
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:42,631
Suyeon, no one can get it
right on the first try....

1248
01:04:42,866 --> 01:04:45,949
...without trial and error.

1249
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,684
So I want you to cheer up.

1250
01:04:49,982 --> 01:04:52,729
I know your dad's not around,
but we're here for you.

1251
01:04:53,209 --> 01:04:56,364
Hey, you have five more people
who support you now.

1252
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:57,963
What's there to be afraid of?

1253
01:04:58,889 --> 01:05:01,498
So whenever you're tired
and feeling down...

1254
01:05:02,082 --> 01:05:03,700
...you can always rely on us.

1255
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:05,692
Don't keep it to yourself.

1256
01:05:07,645 --> 01:05:09,739
Okay. Thank you.

1257
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:13,401
Shall we go now?

1258
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:14,885
Sure, let's go.

1259
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:22,585
-What?
-Huh? What's wrong?

1260
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,896
The car key is gone.
It was in my pocket.

1261
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:27,069
What?

1262
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:29,692
Oh no, I must've dropped
it while walking.

1263
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:32,287
-What should we do?
-What else can we do? Find it!

1264
01:05:32,371 --> 01:05:34,515
Okay, I'll look for it.

1265
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,715
-This is crazy.
-Gosh, you're such an idiot.

1266
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,024
What? Did you just call me an idiot?

1267
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,381
Are you done talking, you moron?

1268
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,627
What? "Moron"?

1269
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:46,102
Yes, I'm done. You stupid idiot meathead.

1270
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,711
"Stupid idiot meathead"?

1271
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:49,451
Not just a meathead but
a stupid idiot meathead?

1272
01:05:49,536 --> 01:05:50,572
Yes, you stupid idiot meathead.

1273
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,131
So childish, my gosh.

1274
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,921
-Just find it already!
-I'm trying! Why don't you help?

1275
01:05:55,005 --> 01:05:57,626
Oh, man. How will we get home?

1276
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,169
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1277
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:15,419
How long have you been staring
at photos of the homeless?

1278
01:06:15,503 --> 01:06:17,224
I'm researching.

1279
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:19,971
So you're an actor and
you're playing a homeless?

1280
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:22,727
I'd like to experience
how the homeless live.

1281
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,651
I'm having another tryout
for the first team tomorrow.

1282
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:26,175
So I don't have to see Byungcheol anymore?

1283
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,286
Byungcheol, I need to tell you...

1284
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:30,110
-I want you to run the kitchen here.
-What?

1285
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,444
I will make the first team this time.

1286
01:06:32,528 --> 01:06:33,993
You can do this, right Kibong?

1287
01:06:35,071 --> 01:06:36,426
He's too ambitious for his own good.

1288
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:39,125
