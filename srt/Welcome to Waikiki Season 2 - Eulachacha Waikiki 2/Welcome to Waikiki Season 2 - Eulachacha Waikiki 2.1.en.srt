1
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:03,977
Bring it on.

2
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:48,088
Cut. Okay.

3
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:52,628
That was great stunts. Good work.

4
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:00,450
Thank you.

5
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,633
Alright, we're done with the stunts,
so bring in the main actress.

6
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:03,568
Okay.

7
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,294
Good work, good work.

8
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,542
Geez.

9
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:14,553
Is it too hard for them to say
that I did a good job?

10
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,603
How did I end up becoming so pathetic?

11
00:02:19,997 --> 00:02:21,913
-Oh my god, that tastes so bad.
-Jungi, your phone.

12
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,382
It's been ringing for a while.

13
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:24,727
Thank you.

14
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:26,847
Hello?

15
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:29,712
What?

16
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,691
Darn it.

17
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:03,475
This song is dedicated to you ladies here.

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,730
It's called "Ddaeng Beol".

19
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:13,882
Sing along.

20
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:19,858
Please clap along.

21
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:22,390
"Housewives Singing Lesson
with Shiba Wooshik"

22
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,737
What? I'm busy.
I'm in the middle of a class.

23
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,752
What?
Darn.

24
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:53,271
"K B Kook"

25
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,356
Yes, there is only one pitch left
to win the championship.

26
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,206
No one has been able to hit
Kook Kibong's pitch for all nine innings.

27
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,448
Everything depends on this last pitch.

28
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,985
The count is three balls and
two strikes right now.

29
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,216
Kook Kibong needs to be careful
about throwing a breaking ball.

30
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,576
It's because Sato is probably
expecting for  a breaking ball.

31
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,866
Yes, this is a very nerve-wracking moment.

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,278
It's a full count for
Kook Kibong right now.

33
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:18,756
Ready...

34
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:30,550
-Strike. He strikes out the batter.
-Yes.

35
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,777
That was great. What a great win.

36
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:34,646
Thank you, Sato.

37
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,936
Everyone, Kook Kibong has
led the team to a victory.

38
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:40,783
Kook Kibong is truly a great player.

39
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,433
Hurry and get up.

40
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:50,599
Hey. Kook Kibong.

41
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,961
I did it. We won. We won.

42
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,085
As if it's not enough
that you passed out while running,

43
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,876
now you're even dreaming, you punk?

44
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,022
Get up already.

45
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:01,564
Don't you want to join the major league?

46
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,408
Are you going to rot
in the minor league forever?

47
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:05,965
Coach,

48
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:07,115
can I take this call?

49
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,884
You idiot, just take it.

50
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,055
Hello?

51
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,694
What is it?
I'm in the middle of training.

52
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,713
What? Darn.

53
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,675
That's it. That's how you should have run.

54
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:28,988
What is he doing?

55
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,279
Where are you going?

56
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:33,478
"Waikiki Guest House"

57
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:34,851
"Waikiki"

58
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,743
What do you think?

59
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:39,516
It's neat inside,
and the interior is great too.

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,666
-It's not bad, right?
-Yes.

61
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,059
On top of that, the location is strategic
so it gets a lot of business.

62
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,483
You can use everything in here.

63
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:47,936
-Isn't that great?
-Yes.

64
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,691
You should think about it.

65
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,161
This is going to drive me crazy.

66
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,915
Why aren't they here yet?

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,775
Everyone who lived here
has become successful.

68
00:05:56,954 --> 00:06:01,116
We've had movie directors, reporters,
shopping mall CEO, and even a pastry chef.

69
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,513
They have all become successful.

70
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,055
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

71
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,827
Who is this?

72
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:14,144
-Who are they?
-They're the only strange ones.

73
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:16,251
I'm serious.

74
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,829
I'm going to give it a bit more thought,

75
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,195
and I'll call you back.

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,556
-Goodbye.
-Wait.

77
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:23,478
-You should have a closer look.
-If you would excuse me.

78
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,496
There's more to see.

79
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,182
-If you just...
-No, no.

80
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,681
Good grief. What are you guys doing?

81
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,991
Ma'am...

82
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,886
How could you put this up for sale
without even discussing it with us?

83
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,500
You should've paid your rent then.

84
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,406
Do you know how many
months you're overdue?

85
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:40,563
About that...

86
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:42,186
Could you give us a week?
We'll figure it out.

87
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,656
One week? Do you know how many months
you've been saying that?

88
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,538
I think it's been about
four months and two weeks...

89
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:50,852
Fine.

90
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,237
I'll give you one more week,

91
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,464
and this will be your last chance.

92
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,198
You better pay up all the overdue rent.

93
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:00,025
Would you just look at yourselves.

94
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,367
Are you guys a traffic light or something?

95
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,591
-Enjoy your day.
-Take care.

96
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,626
What is this tire doing
at this guesthouse?

97
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,390
Look who's talking.

98
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,643
Hey, Red Light.

99
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,939
-Red Light, stop.
-Don't touch me.

100
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,069
-Red Light.
-Hey.

101
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,636
I called you ages ago.
What took you so long?

102
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,428
I ran over as soon as I got the call.

103
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,681
Can't you tell by the fact
that I'm still in my wig and costume?

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,656
I even brought this all the way here.

105
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,204
This is driving me nuts.

106
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,915
How are we going to get
all that money in a week?

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,363
I know, right?

108
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,464
Jeongpal, do you have some money?

109
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:41,771
Do you think I'd be living
off of you, if I did?

110
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,015
I knew it.

111
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,405
But, what's up with your look today?

112
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:47,867
That's what I'm saying.

113
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:51,601
How did I end up from Newsroom's
Song Joonseok to shit like this?

114
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,176
I mean, look at me. I'm a talented actor.

115
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,406
Does it make sense for me
to just play as body doubles?

116
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:58,807
-Just body double?

117
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,378
Looks like you still haven't
come to your senses.

118
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,382
Shut up.

119
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,132
That's why you get dumped by girls.

120
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:07,010
Kim Jeongpal!

121
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:08,797
I told you not to talk about Chewbacca...
I mean...

122
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,763
I said don't talk about Seojin, didn't I?

123
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,203
And again...

124
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:13,401
...I wasn't dumped.

125
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,894
It was a mutual breakup.
Did I not tell you that?

126
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,007
Alright, whatever.

127
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,625
I'm just going to go shower.

128
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:20,592
A shower out of a sudden?

129
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,496
You're leaving after
bringing up a sore spot?

130
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,981
What's that? Why...

131
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,332
Why are you dancing?

132
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:29,330
You stuck your tongue out?
Don't shower, the water bill will be high!

133
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,596
Shut up!

134
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:33,083
In any case, this is all because of you.

135
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,425
So you take the responsibility.

136
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,563
Why?

137
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,556
-Why is it my responsibility?
-You're the CEO.

138
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,457
We're just investors.

139
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:43,971
You said it would be a good investment.

140
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,514
You said we'd be raking in money
if we renovated the house.

141
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:50,052
The global economic recession had change
consumer behaviour, so all guesthouses...

142
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:51,049
Shut up!

143
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:53,586
I'm the idiot here for
trusting you and investing.

144
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,375
You only call me the CEO
when something bad happens.

145
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,722
-Hey, hey.
-People have gathered at Han River Park,

146
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,215
-Look at that.
-to watch a meteor shower.

147
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:01,977
It looks like there's
a festival over here.

148
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,986
-So, what?
-In order to watch the meteor shower,

149
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,776
-What about it?
-that will happen tonight...

150
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,772
I'm just saying that
there are a lot of people there.

151
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,951
Family, friends and couples...

152
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,064
Who could it be?

153
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,696
Who's Meteor Shower?

154
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,615
Who is he that there's that much fuss?

155
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,128
A singer?

156
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,519
If not. Then, an actor?

157
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:19,136
-Are you kidding me?
-I know!

158
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,198
A soccer player?

159
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,273
Wow.

160
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,844
I'm the crazy one here...

161
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,998
...for trusting you guys and
agreeing to work together.

162
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,382
It's all my fault.

163
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,576
I'm the crazy one.

164
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,981
So who's Meteor Shower?

165
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,177
I feel like something good will happen.

166
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:44,760
Are we in a situation to be relaxing
and watching the meteor shower?

167
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:50,780
This is the biggest meteor shower
in history. We can't miss it.

168
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,537
You'll never know.

169
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:56,036
If we make a wish upon a shooting star,
money might rain down from the sky.

170
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,476
It's better to just give it up.

171
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,076
Why are you so negative all the time?

172
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,005
Then what?

173
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:03,310
We might be homeless in a week.
I should stay positive?

174
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,646
That's why you need to be positive.

175
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,795
Wooshik, listen to me carefully.

176
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,773
Hey, Beanpole. Look.

177
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:12,250
Look at each other.

178
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,033
Things can't be worse
than this, can they?

179
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,049
-So?
-So my point is...

180
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:21,481
....we've hit rock bottom in life.

181
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,490
Then, that means...

182
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:27,461
all that's left for us is to go up.
Do you get it?

183
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:30,155
Do you think things could
get worse from here?

184
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:34,378
This is the most positive situation
there could be. Don't you think so?

185
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,201
Do you think that makes
sense, you crazy jerk?

186
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,147
Yes.

187
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,699
Just die. It's a waste of oxygen
for you to breathe. Just die.

188
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:44,589
-Hey, hey. Stop.
-Die.

189
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,059
Seriously, you two.

190
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,274
Hey! It started.

191
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,624
There. Look over there.

192
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,974
So, that's a meteor shower.

193
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:59,045
-It's so cool.
-I know right?

194
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,447
Hey, hey. Look at it.

195
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,574
Hey look at that.

196
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,916
That one is huge, right?

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,876
You're right.

198
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:08,875
But don't you think...

199
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,120
...it looks like it's coming towards us?

200
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,096
I know right.

201
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,826
-Right, Wooshik?
-Whatever.

202
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:16,401
But, isn't that...

203
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,241
...getting a bit too close?

204
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,266
It's so thrilling.

205
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,298
At this rate, it might really fall...

206
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,877
"Guest House Waikiki"

207
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,625
Where is it?

208
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,986
Did a meteor really fall?

209
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:50,782
On our guest house?

210
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,288
It seems like it.

211
00:12:54,602 --> 00:12:56,504
So that's a meteorite.

212
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,077
I guess so.

213
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:01,763
This is so cool. Awesome.

214
00:13:02,108 --> 00:13:04,888
That's so fascinating, right? Isn't it?
It's a meteorite.

215
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,324
You said nothing could get worse.

216
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,946
You said all that was left for us
was to go up. That we had hit rock bottom.

217
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,961
I mean, it's true that we hit rock bottom,

218
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,256
but I didn't think we could
go through the bottom.

219
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,280
Shut up!

220
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,478
Look at that.

221
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,207
There's a hole on the ceiling.

222
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,061
If the landlady finds out about this,
we won't just kicked out,

223
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,263
we'll get sued.
Do you know that?

224
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:26,461
Hey.

225
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,766
It's not our fault.

226
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,313
-It's gravity's fault.
-Do you think she'll believe that?

227
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,516
Last time, when the windows broke
because of the hailstorm,

228
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,306
she blamed it all on us.

229
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,165
That was then and this is different.

230
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:40,346
How could a meteor fell down
on our guest house?

231
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,938
What do we do?

232
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,944
I can't believe a meteor has fallen on us.

233
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,296
Why isn't anything working out for us?

234
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,376
Hey... Wooshik.

235
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,776
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

236
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:55,974
What do we do?

237
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,787
-Wooshik.
-Hurry.

238
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,211
What a genius. A true genius.

239
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,326
You really have the appetite
to eat right now?

240
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,689
-Yeah, it's tasty.
-Tasty?

241
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,562
What if the landlady finds out about this?

242
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,770
You've been whining from a while ago.
Stop it.

243
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,612
I'll handle this. Me.

244
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,126
-What will you do?
-Just sit and watch, Sir.

245
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,919
You need to use your brains.

246
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,812
I think this hole got bigger
than last night.

247
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,546
See. Doesn't it look completely fine now?

248
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:54,750
This is perfect.

249
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,325
The TV's so huge from here.

250
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,145
Ta-da.

251
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,350
-What's this?
-Hey.

252
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,369
Every cent is precious.

253
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,300
We should at least try to sell
whatever we can.

254
00:15:11,051 --> 00:15:13,188
Let's see. Where was it?

255
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,615
Here it is.

256
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:15,660
What's that?

257
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,025
You know Randy Johnson, right?

258
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,528
The major league's legendary
left-handed pitcher.

259
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,690
This is a glove signed by Randy Johnson.

260
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,585
-We could get money if we sell this.
-Really?

261
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,532
"I hope you have a happy life
-Randy Johnson"

262
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:31,478
This...

263
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:33,109
Randy Johnson wrote this?

264
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,873
So, Randy Johnson wrote in Korean,
with clear handwriting...

265
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:39,216
...and even knows the phrase
"Hope you live a happy life"?

266
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,099
-Well, he must've learned Korean.
-Does that make sense?

267
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:43,856
It's fake. Fake.

268
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,036
No, it's not.

269
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,308
I paid my senior 1 million won
to ask this favour from him.

270
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,042
Then what about...

271
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,868
What about this signed bat?

272
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,696
"Kook Kibong-San, Please be happy-desu
-Ichiro"

273
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,946
Fine, let's just say
Ichiro learned Korean.

274
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:01,027
But even then, would he write
"desu" in Korean?

275
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:01,971
Oh...

276
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,093
"Oh"?

277
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,172
Kibong.

278
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,688
Please use your brain.

279
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:06,754
Shut up!

280
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:09,477
You guys are so loud. I can't even eat.

281
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,306
Is it a sin that he's ignorant?

282
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:13,742
Come here, Kibong.

283
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:15,531
As long as you're healthy,
that's all that matters.

284
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,942
You're tall, and you're still growing.

285
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,393
I'm going crazy.

286
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,472
What's this?

287
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:24,832
Where did you get this microphone
with Cho Yongpil's autograph?

288
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:26,901
-I think this is Wooshik's.
-Really?

289
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,930
What are you doing? Get up.

290
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,378
-For what?
-We have to cover that hole.

291
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:32,406
-Get upstairs quick.

292
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,286
Wow, this hole is bigger than we expected.

293
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,825
Since we have to cover it with the sofa,

294
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,141
bring the sofa here
then push it that way.

295
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,538
-Understand?
-Yes, got it.

296
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,341
I fell in here.

297
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,996
Why did you push so hard?

298
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,735
You told me to push.

299
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:01,066
Why are you getting mad at me?

300
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:04,046
-Jeez, you're all brawn but no brain.
-What?.

301
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,254
My foot is all stuck now.

302
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,535
What are you doing? Hurry and help me out.

303
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,362
You're such a mess.

304
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,658
Mr. Cha?

305
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,799
-Are you home?
-Isn't that the landlady's voice?

306
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,052
Why is she here so early?

307
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:21,610
Hold on. She can't know about this.

308
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,104
-Hurry, pull me out. Hurry!
-Mr, Cha!

309
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,561
I'll go down first and stall her.

310
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:25,776
Kibong, you pull him out.

311
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,700
Got it.

312
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:28,383
Come on, Jungi.

313
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,941
Hello, Ma'am.
What brings you here?

314
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,691
I just thought that I lost my earring
here yesterday.

315
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,161
Have you seen it, by any chance?

316
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,183
Your earring?
No, I haven't.

317
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,442
Really?

318
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:50,986
Use some more strength.

319
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,385
I'm trying my best.

320
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,311
But, why isn't your foot budging?

321
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,732
What was that noise?

322
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:03,933
Wasn't there some noise just now?

323
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,336
A noise? No, I didn't hear anything.

324
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,990
Did I mishear it?

325
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,775
Anyway, where could it be?

326
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:13,520
You must be busy, Ma'am.
We'll look for the earring...

327
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:14,606
...and bring it to you later.

328
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,820
It's fine. I'll find it myself.

329
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,627
1, 2, 3...

330
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,386
You heard that too, right?

331
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,713
A sound? No.

332
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,391
I didn't hear anything.

333
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,466
No. I heard something for sure.

334
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,000
I think it came from above.

335
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,842
What are you doing right now?

336
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,150
So...
Well...

337
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:48,923
I love you.

338
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:51,434
What?

339
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:54,632
For a long time,
I've had feelings for you, Ma'am.

340
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,626
What nonsense is this?

341
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,556
It's a bit hard to tell you here.

342
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,812
Let's leave first.

343
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,656
-Let's leave and talk.
-Oh my.

344
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:04,471
Gosh.

345
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,525
-Come with me.
-Let me go.

346
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,983
Let me go.

347
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:11,736
Ouch, it hurts.
You're hurting me.

348
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,114
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:14,680
So...

350
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,093
...is that true?

351
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,793
Do you really...

352
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,466
-...love me?
-What?

353
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,098
How long has it been?

354
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:24,825
Well...

355
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:27,811
It's been about six months.

356
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,896
Six months?

357
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,947
Is that why you've been
putting up with my nagging?

358
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,367
-Yes.
-Oh, my.

359
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,528
I get it now.

360
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,592
I didn't even expect this.

361
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:46,367
Still, this is not right.

362
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:49,198
Our age gap is too large.

363
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,796
Plus, I have children and you know that.

364
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,006
A young man like you and me?
That wouldn't make sense.

365
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:54,954
Right?

366
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,026
I know...

367
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:57,866
...it doesn't make sense.

368
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:00,802
Exactly. This is just ridiculous.

369
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,191
This isn't right.

370
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,543
I guess I was being too greedy.

371
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,287
I apologize.

372
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,855
I'll be off then.

373
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:15,141
Try being greedy.

374
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:16,451
Sorry?

375
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,057
It's not like you can stop
your feelings for someone just like that.

376
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:23,085
So...

377
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,804
You should try become greedy, for once.

378
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,836
I like greedy men.

379
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:39,988
What?

380
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,594
-You're dating the landlady?
-Yes.

381
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:48,899
Today's the first day of our relationship.

382
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:51,222
We have to go on dates now.

383
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,970
Why would you lie about
something like that?

384
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:56,215
-What should I do now?
-No, no.

385
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,557
It's for the better.

386
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:59,900
She probably won't ask for rent
for a while.

387
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,016
Would she ask for rent from her boyfriend?

388
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,618
-Then, I'm supposed to keep dating her?
-Yeah.

389
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,446
That's a scam, you punk.

390
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,638
No, it's not.

391
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,843
-You can just date her for real.
-Huh?

392
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:10,932
I mean, she's not that bad.

393
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,254
She owns a lot of buildings,
money, wrinkles...

394
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:15,882
And she's old too.

395
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,801
Look at yourself.
She's completely out of your league.

396
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,780
Do you think that makes sense right now?

397
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,711
Then, should we just start
living on the streets?

398
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,680
This is driving me crazy.

399
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,266
Why did things turn out like this?

400
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,446
Think about it. It's an opportunity.

401
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm here.

402
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,786
Hi. Did you come back
from your part-time job?

403
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:39,610
Yeah. I had three part-time jobs today.
I feel like I'm dying.

404
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,956
What's up with him?

405
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,140
He has his reasons.

406
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,667
What's this box?

407
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,160
What's with this yearbook?

408
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,296
That's our high school yearbook.

409
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,153
Really?

410
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:53,458
Should I take a look?

411
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:54,829
There's nothing to see.

412
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,265
"Kook Kibong"

413
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,757
"Cha Wooshik"
You all look so young.

414
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:00,736
"Lee Jungi"

415
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,223
Who's this girl?

416
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:07,492
-Why is she surrounded by so many boys?
-Which one?

417
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,580
It's Suyeon.

418
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,076
Her name is Han Suyeon.

419
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,245
Our first love.

420
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,757
-First love?
-Yeah.

421
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:16,916
What do you mean by "Our"?

422
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:19,806
So she was you three's first love?

423
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,898
That's right.

424
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:24,826
Not just us, but all the boys
in our entire school.

425
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,831
Really?

426
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,986
She's not even that pretty.

427
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,106
Kim Jeongeun!

428
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,111
Gosh, you startled me.

429
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,796
Why did you yell at me?

430
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:33,240
You're out of line.

431
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,386
"She's not even that pretty"?

432
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:36,905
Suyeon was...

433
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,069
...a goddess.
A goddess!

434
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:43,638
"Huam High School"

435
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,405
-Left, right, left, right.
-Left, right, left, right.

436
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,576
Guys!

437
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,764
Huge news.

438
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,971
What is this fuss about?

439
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,407
There's going to be a transfer
student in our class today.

440
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:28,073
And guess what?
It's a girl!

441
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:30,901
Plus, she's supposed to be super pretty.

442
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,934
I thought it was something big.
We're not interested in things like that.

443
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:36,958
There she is.

444
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,239
We're not interested.

445
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:47,914
Move.

446
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,603
We fell in love with Suyeon
at first sight.

447
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:55,036
She had a nice face, body,

448
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:57,214
and even a bright personality.

449
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,881
She was just perfect.

450
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,489
Not only was her family rich,

451
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:04,225
but she was exuding elegance
from head to toe.

452
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,433
So, what happened?

453
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:15,700
Did you confess your feelings?

454
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,888
Of course we did.

455
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,727
Knock, knock.

456
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:23,629
Have a drink.

457
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:27,112
Alright. Thanks. I'll enjoy the drink.

458
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:30,123
If you drink it,

459
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:31,771
it means we're dating.

460
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,679
Too bad.

461
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,893
I already saw you take a sip.

462
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:48,868
So, today's our first day of dating...?

463
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,405
That day, Suyeon vomited
all her gastric juice and bile.

464
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:57,011
Every single drop of it.

465
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,341
What about you, Kibong?
What happened?

466
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,529
Han Suyeon!

467
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:08,846
With this ball,

468
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,684
if I can hit that can,

469
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,373
it means we're dating.

470
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,036
That was the first day Kibong's
pitch resulted in a home run.

471
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,705
And that was how our first love
came to an end.

472
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,973
How pathetic. So pathetic.

473
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:57,432
What about you, Wooshik?
You didn't confess your feelings?

474
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,018
That's none of your business.

475
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,846
Geez.

476
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:06,499
What was that?

477
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,286
What's with him all of a sudden?

478
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,966
I don't know. He does that
whenever we mention Suyeon.

479
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,266
That's right.

480
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,064
It's the stunt director.

481
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,141
Hello, sir. Yes.

482
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,995
One more person?

483
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,503
Yes, I know someone who can do it. Yes.

484
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,186
Alright. I'll see you soon.

485
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,706
-You don't have any training today, right?
-Yes. Why?

486
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,238
The stunt director just called,
and he said he needs an extra urgently.

487
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:32,167
Why don't you come with me?

488
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,466
-Don't hit me too hard!
-Okay. I got it.

489
00:26:40,685 --> 00:26:41,788
Here? Do it properly.

490
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,890
Shooting is not a joke.

491
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:48,714
Okay, listen up!

492
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:50,749
Quiet down.

493
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:52,281
Listen to me carefully.

494
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,396
This scene is where the police discovered
the gangsters' hideout in the mountain.

495
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,275
It's a fight scene with
the police officers.

496
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:02,118
So, you just need to follow exactly
what we practiced. That's it.

497
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,536
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

498
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,388
Okay.

499
00:27:04,477 --> 00:27:05,844
Now, then...

500
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,016
-You. What was your name?
-I'm Kook Kibong.

501
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,317
Kibong. That's right, Kibong.

502
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,751
Kibong, since you're the first person,

503
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,548
you'll be hit in the head
with the police officer's baton.

504
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,798
Then, you'll die instantly.
Just like that.

505
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:22,257
Understand? Don't close your eyes.

506
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:24,732
Never close them. Keep them wide open
and then die instantly.

507
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,616
I'm going to die with my eyes open?

508
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,822
Didn't I just tell you that
you'd die instantly?!

509
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,116
-In an instant!
-Okay.

510
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,306
And, for Junho...

511
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,009
I'm Jungi. Lee Jungi.

512
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,339
Jungi. That's right, Jungi.

513
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:36,720
Sorry, sorry. Jungi.

514
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,207
Jungi, you'll fight the police,

515
00:27:39,296 --> 00:27:42,708
but you'll be holding the fire
extinguisher and die instantly like that.

516
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:44,390
-You just die instantly.
-Die instantly.

517
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,949
-Yes, that's right.
-Alright.

518
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:47,550
Okay. Everyone is clear right?

519
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,817
Die instantly.

520
00:27:51,097 --> 00:27:51,935
You.

521
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,649
What was your name again?

522
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,601
Sorry?

523
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,087
Just play along with it.

524
00:27:58,335 --> 00:27:59,651
I'm Kook Kibong.

525
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,646
Kibong. That's right. Kibong.

526
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,936
Kibong, so, what should we do with you?

527
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,689
Kibong, since you're the first person,

528
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,036
you'll be hit in the head by the
police officer's baton.

529
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,311
-And then...
-You...

530
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,167
...already told me.

531
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:13,489
Die instantly.

532
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:15,236
I did? Yes, I did.

533
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,351
Kibong, die instantly.
Don't close your eyes.

534
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,006
-And as for Junbong.
-It's Jungi. Jungi. Lee Jungi.

535
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,778
-Jungi. That's right, Jungi.
-I'm Jungi.

536
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,091
So for Jungi... you'll fight the police,

537
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,899
but you'll be holding
the fire extinguisher and...

538
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:30,216
You already told me.
I have to die instantly.

539
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,394
-Lee Jungi, die instantly.
-Right, die instantly. I already told you.

540
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:35,413
Okay, die instantly. Okay.

541
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:37,101
Everyone knows what they're doing, right?

542
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,689
Excuse me, Director.

543
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:40,585
-We're ready.
-This is the director.

544
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:42,756
-It's me.
-Director, we're ready.

545
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,366
He's gotten worse.

546
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,439
Jungi...

547
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:47,324
...isn't he a bit strange?

548
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:48,675
He's always like that.

549
00:28:48,982 --> 00:28:52,364
He hurt his head while doing a stunt
so his memory only lasts three seconds.

550
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:53,554
I see.

551
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:54,641
Just be understanding.

552
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,106
So, Kibong, you'll die instantly.

553
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,636
I'll die instantly, too.

554
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,753
Lee Jungi, you punk.
You'll really die instantly today.

555
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:02,891
Come here!

556
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,303
Die instantly.

557
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,282
Okay...
Ready, action!

558
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:25,358
Don't follow me!

559
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,129
Ouch. That hurts.

560
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:38,800
Get off me.

561
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,241
Thank you.

562
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,009
Die!

563
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:52,267
That's right. Die instantly.

564
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,985
Ouch. Geez.

565
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:02,445
That's right. Die instantly.

566
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,180
Don't come any closer.

567
00:30:37,622 --> 00:30:38,686
Go away. Go.

568
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,922
No. No, no.

569
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:42,114
Don't come near me.

570
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:44,509
No.

571
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:57,198
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

572
00:30:57,297 --> 00:30:58,331
Be quiet!

573
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,796
Director, it seems that there's
a problem with the fire extinguisher.

574
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,546
I'm the director.

575
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,714
Hey, cut! Cut!

576
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,147
Kibong!

577
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:07,356
My eyes!

578
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:09,790
Open your eyes.

579
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,342
-Open your eyes.
-Ouch! That hurts.

580
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,802
Ouch, it hurts. I can't open my eyes.

581
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,428
My eyes won't open.

582
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:20,186
Why would you aim the fire extinguisher
to your face like that instead of dying?

583
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,356
And how could you kill
a guy who's already dead?

584
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,604
I'm sorry.

585
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,712
Hey, hold on.

586
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,146
This is so frustrating. Here, hold this.

587
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,534
Hold on to this, and get some rest. Okay?

588
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,529
-Thank you.
-How frustrating.

589
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:40,478
By the way, who's this guy next to you?
I've never seen him before.

590
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,805
How many times have I told you
that he's my friend?

591
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,571
Really? He's your friend?

592
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,830
Why is he here, though?

593
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,416
Obviously he came here
to shoot some scenes.

594
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:54,941
No, never mind.
He's just here to hang out.

595
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,169
I see? Okay.

596
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,050
I'm glad you're here.

597
00:31:58,236 --> 00:31:59,116
Enjoy your visit.

598
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,456
It's cool, right?

599
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,787
-Cool?
-What is the next scene?

600
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:05,476
--The next scene will be...
-Gosh.

601
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,630
Well, then...

602
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,246
What are you guys doing here?

603
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,426
Are you not filming?

604
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:14,661
You told us to take a rest
because our eyes hurt.

605
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:17,544
I did?

606
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:18,577
I did...

607
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:20,746
That's right. Okay.

608
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,578
I'm sorry. Just take a rest.

609
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,842
What's the next scene?

610
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:25,480
Geez. Seriously.

611
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,441
His condition is getting worse.

612
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:29,565
Ouch. My eyes.

613
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:31,691
My eyes. My eyes.

614
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:33,335
My eyes.

615
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:36,160
-They hurt so much.
-This is all your fault.

616
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:49,349
That's why...

617
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:51,433
... I told you to eat slowly.

618
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:54,560
Yes.

619
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:58,739
Why? Are you really that nervous
to be with me?

620
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,263
What?

621
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,136
Oh, yes.

622
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,843
You're cute.

623
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:06,961
Anyway,

624
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:09,977
I should've caught on sooner.

625
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,854
It must have been so difficult
keeping it to yourself.

626
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,701
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha.

627
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:21,908
No, I mean...

628
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:24,265
I'm sorry...

629
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,320
...Wooshik.

630
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:29,416
Wooshik?

631
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,205
This is driving me insane.

632
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,786
Cha Wooshik?

633
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:35,666
How much longer will you put up with this?

634
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,262
No matter how desperate you are
to pay the rent, this is just not right.

635
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,310
Fine.

636
00:33:40,554 --> 00:33:42,161
I'll just be honest with her now.

637
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,097
Ma'am.

638
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,229
-Yes?
-I have something to tell you.

639
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:46,191
What is it?

640
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:47,588
The thing is...

641
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,371
Hold on.

642
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,021
Hello?

643
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:54,420
What?

644
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:56,109
It was a lie?

645
00:33:56,209 --> 00:34:00,031
Don't you know that out of all things,
I can never tolerate with lies?

646
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,395
What else do you think
you're supposed to do?!

647
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,616
Throw him in prison right now!

648
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,364
How dare he lie to me?

649
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:11,324
You don't need to show mercy
to trash like him.

650
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:14,376
Even if I have to put all my fortune on
the line, I'm not letting him go.

651
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,886
I don't care if it takes
a 100 or 1,000 lawyers.

652
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:20,710
Make sure that he doesn't see sunlight
again for the rest of his life.

653
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,909
I'm sorry. Sorry.

654
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:37,829
It's another new tenant,

655
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,021
and he lied to me.

656
00:34:40,105 --> 00:34:42,657
The thing I hate the most in the world...

657
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,954
is lies.

658
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:46,269
By the way...

659
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:49,475
...didn't you say
you have something to tell me?

660
00:34:51,294 --> 00:34:52,234
About that...

661
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,750
I wish time stopped like this.

662
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,198
Oh my. Geez.

663
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:04,230
Would you just stop it.

664
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,244
I fell asleep.

665
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:25,834
Ouch. My eyes.

666
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:34,532
Wait.

667
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,999
Why is it so quiet?

668
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:37,004
Hello?

669
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:39,600
Hello?

670
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:41,028
Is anyone there?

671
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:42,529
Excuse...
Ouch!

672
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:45,384
Hello?

673
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:46,947
Director?

674
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:48,332
Director?

675
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,912
Is nobody there?!

676
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:51,186
Gosh, you scared me.

677
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:55,012
What the hell.
Why are you shouting?

678
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,475
Sorry, sorry.

679
00:35:57,672 --> 00:35:59,914
This feels weird.
I don't think anyone is here.

680
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,146
They left us here
after finishing the shoot?

681
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,624
Call the director quickly.

682
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:08,276
Okay, good idea.

683
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,720
Are you calling him?

684
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,736
The staff members said they'd keep
our phones, remember? You idiot.

685
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,692
That's right.

686
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:26,286
What do we do now?

687
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,540
How am I supposed to know? You idiot.

688
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,003
Gosh, how could they leave us
when we can't even see properly.

689
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,097
Hello?

690
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,756
Hello?

691
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:43,168
-Hello.
-There are people here.

692
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:45,960
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello. Hello.

693
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,307
There are people here.

694
00:36:52,884 --> 00:36:54,264
This is nice.

695
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,196
I don't even remember the last time
I walked with a man like this.

696
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:02,913
But...

697
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,788
...why have you been
breaking in cold sweat?

698
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,041
-Are you sick?
-What?

699
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:09,551
No...

700
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:10,986
...it's not that.

701
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,327
What is it, then?

702
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,865
You're unbelievable.

703
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:19,607
Gosh...

704
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:22,671
Is this good enough?

705
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,101
If you wanted to link arms with me,
you could've said so.

706
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,473
You fool.

707
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:36,777
I'm going insane.

708
00:37:37,074 --> 00:37:39,274
She'll go berserk,
if she finds out the truth.

709
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,420
But, still, this isn't right.

710
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:42,668
It's not right.

711
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:44,961
I'd rather go to prison,

712
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:47,083
I can't ignore my conscience anymore.

713
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,649
Ma'am,

714
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:51,610
I have something to tell you.

715
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:52,994
What is it?

716
00:37:53,378 --> 00:37:54,306
Well, the thing is...

717
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,801
-Mom!
-Well...

718
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,922
Son!

719
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,700
Wooshik,

720
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:18,039
say hi.

721
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,382
This is my son.

722
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:23,199
-Hello.
-Mom!

723
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,385
Oh my, son.

724
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,833
Wooshik,

725
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:48,972
say hello.

726
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,461
This is my second son.

727
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,389
He...

728
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,230
Hello.

729
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,120
Who is this?

730
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:58,856
It's someone I'm dating as of today.

731
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,294
My sons, you understand me, right?

732
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:02,263
Of course.

733
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:04,264
We're fine as long as you're happy.

734
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,961
But did he approach you...

735
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,535
...because of your money,
like the last one?

736
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,324
No...

737
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,140
He said he liked me since six months ago.

738
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,046
But, he finally mustered
the courage and told me now.

739
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,513
That's a relief, then

740
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,401
Hey, listen.

741
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,917
We won't let you go
if you make our mom cry.

742
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,818
Wooshik's not that type of person.

743
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:30,648
Didn't you say you had something
to tell me earlier?

744
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:31,616
What is it?

745
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,182
Well...

746
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,946
I just wanted to say that
I don't want to say goodbye yet.

747
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:46,846
Oh my.

748
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,193
My kids are watching,

749
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:50,519
and you've just blurted it out like that.

750
00:39:58,038 --> 00:39:59,694
Jungi, wait for me.

751
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,415
Would you just hurry up?!

752
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,415
Where are we?

753
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,166
Are we even going the right way?
What the hell is this?

754
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,516
That's why we should've just stayed there.

755
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,573
They could've come back for us.

756
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,403
What? Come back for us?

757
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:14,761
I've known the stunt
director for eight years.

758
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,216
But, he still doesn't know my name.

759
00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:18,866
Just give it up!
He won't come back looking for us.

760
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,203
Still, we can't even see,
how are we supposed to get home like this?

761
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:23,659
We'll just try to find the main road
and hitchhike.

762
00:40:23,748 --> 00:40:25,086
Just follow me.

763
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,424
Fine.

764
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:31,772
-Hold on. Wait a minute.
-What?

765
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:34,681
My stomach hurts all of a sudden.

766
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,026
I told you to eat only a little.
But you ate three servings.

767
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,192
I was hungry, I couldn't help it!

768
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:42,153
Is there any toilet around?

769
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:46,326
How can you go to the bathroom
when we can't see anything?

770
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,656
Just do your business anywhere.

771
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,992
Fine.

772
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,324
But, do you have tissues?

773
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,316
Why would I have tissues
in the middle of a mountain?

774
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,001
-Just wipe it with your necktie.
-Fine.

775
00:40:57,273 --> 00:41:01,530
-Why do you keep getting annoyed at me?
-How can I not be annoyed?

776
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,726
Go do it. I'll stay here.

777
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,047
-What's this?
-My stomach.

778
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,016
Kibong.
There are tissues here.

779
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,346
"Scent Of The Woods Camping Grounds"

780
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,334
How about we play a silent 007 game?

781
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:22,266
-That sounds good.
-Sure.

782
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,758
You'll get punished if you make a sound.
I'll start first.

783
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:42,973
Oh, my stomach. Ouch.

784
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,901
Oh, my stomach. Ouch.

785
00:41:54,674 --> 00:41:56,975
It's quiet here.
There must be no one here.

786
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,600
Geez, I thought I'd die.

787
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:02,799
That's right.

788
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:04,028
My tissues.

789
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,382
Who's there?!

790
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,232
Kibong.

791
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,620
Kibong. I had tissues with me.

792
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:43,149
What's wrong with him?

793
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,287
What was that?

794
00:42:46,457 --> 00:42:48,071
What's that sound?
Who are you with?

795
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,899
-Jungi.
-Yeah?

796
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,440
I pooped.

797
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:58,416
"Waikiki Guest House"

798
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:00,909
We didn't get paid,

799
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:02,470
and our eyes got hurt.

800
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:05,199
All I got is utter humiliation.

801
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,154
What kind of life is this?

802
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,422
That's still better than my situation.

803
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:16,066
I have to go to a theme park with
the landlady and her sons tomorrow.

804
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:18,558
They said they want me
to buy them cotton candy.

805
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:21,450
I have sons now.

806
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:24,582
How come nothing works out for us?

807
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,474
When I tried my very best.

808
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,961
Why does life never turn out right?

809
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:36,209
We had pretty great lives back then.

810
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:37,693
Right?

811
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,446
Yeah, that's true.

812
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,122
When I think about the old times,

813
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:42,850
I thought that by now,

814
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,110
I'd be in Carnegie Hall
with an orchestral group,

815
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,606
and performing an amazing concert there.

816
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,356
I thought I'd be in Hollywood
and win Oscars.

817
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:55,328
I thought I'd be in the Major League,

818
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:59,007
and be playing along side with
Ryu Hyunjin and Choo Shinsoo.

819
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,189
But, you know...

820
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:07,024
...it's not over for us yet, right?

821
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:08,672
It's not...

822
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:10,805
...time to give up yet, right?

823
00:44:10,894 --> 00:44:12,013
Of course not.

824
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:13,337
I'm never giving up.

825
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:14,291
That's right.

826
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,079
I can't give up
with the situation I'm in right now.

827
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:18,268
I have to strike out Choo Shinsoo
before I do.

828
00:44:19,525 --> 00:44:21,852
Let's not do that with a fellow Korean.

829
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,749
You should cut Choo Shinsoo some slack.

830
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:24,910
Nonsense.

831
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:25,920
You think so?

832
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:27,252
Then...

833
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:31,135
I won't give up until Choo Shinsoo
gets a home-run from my pitch.

834
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,130
-Yes, that's better.
-You crazy punk.

835
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:40,916
That's it. Let's cheer up.

836
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:44,386
"Success is for those who don't give up."

837
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,769
An old saint once said that.

838
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:47,705
That's right.

839
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:49,573
Let's just try our best until the end.

840
00:44:49,662 --> 00:44:51,131
It'll work out somehow.

841
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,420
But, Wooshik...

842
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,849
...who's Old Saint?

843
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:54,784
Oh my.

844
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:55,756
What?

845
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,908
You said the quote was from Old Saint.

846
00:44:59,735 --> 00:45:02,002
Is there any Old Saint in our country?

847
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:04,077
I've never heard of that name before.

848
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,700
-Why you little...
-Hey, stop. Don't do it.

849
00:45:06,935 --> 00:45:09,097
It'll only infuriate you even more.
Just don't.

850
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,796
Let's go to bed. I'm sleepy.

851
00:45:11,268 --> 00:45:12,359
Yes, you're right.

852
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:13,670
Hold my hands.

853
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:15,199
Take me...
Wait...

854
00:45:15,317 --> 00:45:17,985
Who is that Old Saint?

855
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:20,866
-He's a scientist? He's Chinese, isn't he?
-Shut up!

856
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,999
Take me, too. I can't...

857
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,543
I can't see, either.

858
00:45:26,212 --> 00:45:29,079
Be gentle. Ouch, it hurts.

859
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,057
Hold on.

860
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,696
Oh yeah! I can see.

861
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,253
Wow, I can see now. I can see!

862
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:42,983
Me too.
Thank goodness.

863
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,955
Why do you guys live like this?

864
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,738
What's wrong with you guys?

865
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:48,937
By the way, where's Wooshik?

866
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,012
Wooshik?

867
00:45:58,434 --> 00:45:59,385
He went...

868
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:00,874
...somewhere.

869
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,786
Mom, Mom.

870
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:11,394
Let's just ride the merry-go-round
one more time.

871
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:14,553
-One more time. One more time.
-Again?

872
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,667
Wooshik, you don't mind
if we ride one more time, right?

873
00:46:19,436 --> 00:46:20,492
Whoa, uncle, you're the best.

874
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:21,968
Uncle, you're so cool.

875
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,056
-Ta-da...
-Oh, yes.

876
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,526
Let me get some first.

877
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,772
If you're going to be like this,
then work at a ramyun company.

878
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:45,366
One chopstick full.

879
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,746
Just take a little.

880
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,234
-You should just eat little.
-I didn't even take anything yet.

881
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,504
-I'm home.
-Hi. Come sit and eat some ramyun.

882
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:57,428
Did you have fun at the theme park?

883
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:00,667
That headband looks great on you.

884
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:03,609
Did you buy her sons cotton candy?

885
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:06,398
Did her sons say, "Thank you, Father".

886
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,654
"Dad! Daddy, Daddy."

887
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:11,697
Don't laugh at me!

888
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,777
What is this?

889
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,463
What is all this?

890
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:20,272
What kind of grown men
like the merry-go-round so much?

891
00:47:20,395 --> 00:47:23,481
I rode that more than 30 times.

892
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,950
Just be patient until we get enough
money for the rent and repair costs.

893
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,532
-He's right.
-What?

894
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:32,319
That's almost 10 million won all together.

895
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:34,856
You're telling me to keep this up
until we save that much money?

896
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:36,090
Then, what?

897
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:38,982
You rather sleep on the streets
where it's cold and windy?

898
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,241
This is driving me crazy.

899
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,249
-Who is it now?!
-What's wrong?

900
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:46,737
Eat up. Eat up.

901
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,366
Hello?

902
00:47:49,777 --> 00:47:50,611
What?

903
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:52,063
Really?

904
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:53,810
Okay.

905
00:47:53,899 --> 00:47:55,008
I'll be there soon.

906
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:57,061
What is it? What happened?

907
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,432
It's a wedding planner I know.

908
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:01,004
She said a wedding singer canceled
and wants me to fill in.

909
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:02,629
You just got back
and now you're leaving again?

910
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:03,922
Have some ramyun first.

911
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:06,286
Do you think I have time
to eat ramyun right now?

912
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:09,660
I'm going to get money
as soon as I can,

913
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:12,942
and break free from
this horrifying situation!

914
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:16,126
You guys shouldn't be
idling around either!

915
00:48:16,235 --> 00:48:17,866
Go out and make some money.

916
00:48:17,955 --> 00:48:18,788
Do you understand?!

917
00:48:18,877 --> 00:48:19,761
Ouch!

918
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,056
It's time for my part-time job.

919
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,420
Hey! Wait for me! Let's go together!

920
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,647
Sit here and eat. Wooshik, you should eat.

921
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,705
Hi.

922
00:48:41,893 --> 00:48:42,876
You're here.

923
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,610
I'm sorry for calling you
at the last minute.

924
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:46,816
The wedding singer got into an accident.

925
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,734
It's okay. I'm grateful that you did.
I'm in need of money, you see.

926
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:51,380
Really? It all worked out then.

927
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:53,913
Let's meet the bride and groom first.
Follow me.

928
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:54,951
Alright.

929
00:48:56,985 --> 00:48:58,296
-Thank you.
-You're so beautiful.

930
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,507
-Your dress is so pretty.
-That's right.

931
00:49:00,806 --> 00:49:02,762
-Don't forget your bouquet.
-Thank you.

932
00:49:15,694 --> 00:49:16,853
Han Suyeon?

933
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,164
Why are you being so shy?

934
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:20,373
Let's go meet her.

935
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,367
Hello, Miss Han.

936
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:25,964
What's wrong?

937
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,607
-Are you crazy?
-On second thought...

938
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:31,860
...let's leave first. Right now.

939
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:33,533
Please.

940
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:36,166
We're already here. How can we leave?

941
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:37,618
Oh my.

942
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,581
Miss Han, I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

943
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,864
Don't do this.

944
00:49:41,953 --> 00:49:43,245
What's wrong with you?

945
00:49:43,396 --> 00:49:44,243
Oh my god.

946
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:46,814
Put me down. Put me down. Put me down.

947
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,126
-What's with you?.
-I'm sorry.

948
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,178
I'm really sorry.

949
00:49:51,524 --> 00:49:53,532
But you need to find someone else to sing.
I have to go.

950
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,596
Where are you going?
Why are you being like this?

951
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,920
Don't ask.

952
00:49:58,009 --> 00:49:58,868
Just let me go.

953
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,854
But the ceremony will start in 30 minutes.
How can I find another singer?

954
00:50:01,943 --> 00:50:03,366
Plus, you said you needed money.

955
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,945
Even if I need money...

956
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,377
...I can't do this.

957
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,274
I'm really sorry.

958
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,652
Alright. Fine.

959
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:12,372
I'll pay you double.
1 million won.

960
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:15,026
Money isn't the problem right now.

961
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:16,981
-1.5 million.
-Whatever. I can't do this.

962
00:50:17,484 --> 00:50:18,369
2 million.

963
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,123
Fine. Whatever.
I can't take this any longer.

964
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,601
Geez.

965
00:50:28,072 --> 00:50:28,924
Don't...

966
00:50:30,454 --> 00:50:31,354
In return...

967
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:32,919
...I have a favor to ask.

968
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:40,733
Oh, yes.

969
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:42,676
I wanted a consultation for a loan.

970
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:43,604
Yes.

971
00:50:44,096 --> 00:50:45,228
Employer?

972
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:47,257
I don't have one.

973
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:48,465
Collateral?

974
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:49,861
I don't have any.

975
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:51,965
A car?

976
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:53,802
I do have one.

977
00:50:53,886 --> 00:50:55,214
Her name is Rebecca.

978
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,763
She's a 2001 or 2002 model...

979
00:50:57,852 --> 00:51:00,232
Hello? Hello?

980
00:51:03,153 --> 00:51:04,478
They hung up on me again.

981
00:51:05,443 --> 00:51:08,454
Gosh, even people at the bank
look down on me too.

982
00:51:09,828 --> 00:51:11,637
-Alright.
-What are you doing?

983
00:51:12,388 --> 00:51:13,920
How can you eat ramyun...

984
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:16,749
How many packets did you cook?!

985
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:17,681
Eight.

986
00:51:19,378 --> 00:51:21,869
We should eat a lot
to get the energy to work.

987
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:24,013
Fine.

988
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:26,669
Keep eating. Eat up.

989
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:27,802
So hot.

990
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:33,476
Can't money just fall from the sky?

991
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:40,180
A few days ago, a meteorite fell
on a greenhouse and it became a hot topic.

992
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,570
It fell here, too.

993
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:43,622
-It is dubbed as the "fallen lottery".
-Ah, "lottery".

994
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:46,009
-Yeah, right.
-In the past, a rare 500 grams meteorite,

995
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:47,979
was sold for 500 million won.

996
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,201
The outside is seriously blackened,

997
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,699
however since the inside
is denser than most rocks,

998
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:55,836
it is a defining factor to show
that it might be a meteorite.

999
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:56,698
500...

1000
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,445
500 million won?!

1001
00:51:59,793 --> 00:52:01,088
It's true.

1002
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:03,303
I'm serious. For real.

1003
00:52:03,392 --> 00:52:05,463
It fell on our guesthouse a few days ago.

1004
00:52:05,794 --> 00:52:06,818
Yes.

1005
00:52:07,468 --> 00:52:08,335
Yes.

1006
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:09,871
The coffee shop at Grand Hotel?

1007
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:11,292
Yes, I know where it is.

1008
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:13,620
I'll see you soon, Professor. Goodbye.

1009
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:15,578
Jungi, what did he say?

1010
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:16,667
He collects meteorites,

1011
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,229
and said that he'll see our pretty
little thing before he buys it.

1012
00:52:19,753 --> 00:52:21,400
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

1013
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,831
You're going to take Rebecca?

1014
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:25,824
Yeah.

1015
00:52:25,991 --> 00:52:27,537
I don't want to get in that.

1016
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:31,122
It smells weird inside.

1017
00:52:32,012 --> 00:52:33,844
She'll be hurt if she hears that.

1018
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,480
Shut it. You smell even worse. Just go.

1019
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:38,623
It really does smell pretty bad.

1020
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:41,008
You smell worse.

1021
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:44,763
Let's go.

1022
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,306
What's this? What's wrong with this?

1023
00:52:49,395 --> 00:52:50,631
It's fine.

1024
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,341
You said she smelled weird,
so Becca's upset now.

1025
00:52:53,435 --> 00:52:54,795
Just close the door so that we can go.

1026
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:57,228
Sorry.

1027
00:53:00,649 --> 00:53:02,613
It's totally fine.

1028
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:05,244
You can just close it really gently.
Like patting a baby.

1029
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,424
I'm sorry, Becca.

1030
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:09,030
Gently...

1031
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:13,265
Is this AI, or what?

1032
00:53:13,354 --> 00:53:16,267
It's fine. We can close them
at the same time.

1033
00:53:16,356 --> 00:53:17,352
Both at the same time.

1034
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:21,330
Alright. One, two, three.

1035
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:29,862
Jungi.

1036
00:53:29,951 --> 00:53:31,231
We're so lucky.

1037
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,360
I know.

1038
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:34,622
By the way, how much are we selling this?

1039
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,616
Earlier, the news said
it's 500 million won for 500 grams.

1040
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:39,280
Then, this one...

1041
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:40,520
-Maybe 1 billion won?
-1 billion...

1042
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:41,606
No, no.

1043
00:53:41,695 --> 00:53:43,435
-2 billion?
-2 billion?

1044
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,914
2 billion?

1045
00:53:45,003 --> 00:53:46,025
No. Wait a second.

1046
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:47,502
We'll sell this...

1047
00:53:47,747 --> 00:53:49,797
-...pay our rent, then...
-Yes, the rent.

1048
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,295
I'm sorry to Rebecca,
but I'll buy a great car too.

1049
00:53:54,379 --> 00:53:55,317
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1050
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:56,692
Then, what else?

1051
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:57,857
First thing first,

1052
00:53:57,992 --> 00:54:00,497
I want go to a fancy buffet
and eat all I want.

1053
00:54:00,586 --> 00:54:02,144
-That sounds delicious.
-Then...

1054
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:04,995
I'll go to a fancy sushi restaurant
and eat a tonne of sushi.

1055
00:54:05,084 --> 00:54:07,504
Then, I'm going to a fancy
Korean barbecue restaurant,

1056
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:09,504
-and eat...
-Hold on. Hold on for a second.

1057
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:10,843
What are you doing?

1058
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:14,063
This is my meteorite.

1059
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:15,699
Why are you making plans?

1060
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:17,294
What do you mean it's yours?

1061
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:20,520
Why is it yours?

1062
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:24,008
It fell on my guesthouse.

1063
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:25,107
Isn't that what you guys said?

1064
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:27,560
I'm the CEO and you are the investors.

1065
00:54:27,649 --> 00:54:30,275
So, I can just pay back your investments.
Isn't that how it goes?

1066
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,585
If you say that, then the landlady
is the true owner. How is it yours?

1067
00:54:32,674 --> 00:54:34,650
The landlady does not know about this.

1068
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,436
Then I can just tell her.

1069
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,375
Me.

1070
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:40,442
-Are you crazy?
-What do you want to do?

1071
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:43,080
Do you want to split or not?

1072
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,715
Or, I'm just going to give her a call.

1073
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:47,772
Don't do it, or you'll die.
Don't do it.

1074
00:54:47,861 --> 00:54:49,785
So, hurry and answer me.

1075
00:54:49,874 --> 00:54:52,611
If not, I'm going to press call.

1076
00:54:54,576 --> 00:54:55,526
Okay, fine.

1077
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:57,970
This is what you want, right?
Then go for it.

1078
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:00,055
Go ahead. Do it. Do it. Do it.

1079
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:02,086
Fine...

1080
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:03,475
I'll really call her.

1081
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,875
-You see it, right? I'm halfway there.
-Do it.

1082
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:08,165
-The call is about to be connected.
-Do it.

1083
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:09,951
If I let go, the call
is going to go through.

1084
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:10,960
Do it.

1085
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:13,675
-Don't do it. Stop.
-Hey.

1086
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,797
So, let's split in half.

1087
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:20,305
Let's split...
Hey, focus on the road!

1088
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,585
Alright, now, the star of the day,
the bride, will enter.

1089
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:28,325
Please give her a big round of applause.

1090
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,232
The bride is entering.

1091
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,052
She's beautiful as always.

1092
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:00,847
Because of money, I'm singing
the congratulatory song,

1093
00:56:00,936 --> 00:56:02,235
at my first love's wedding.

1094
00:56:02,385 --> 00:56:05,802
Life sure is crappy.

1095
00:56:08,835 --> 00:56:11,057
-You animal. How can you bite my arm?
-Shut up.

1096
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:12,297
You're unbelievable.

1097
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:14,983
You're really bad at driving.

1098
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:19,469
We're going to split
it exactly in half, okay?

1099
00:56:19,669 --> 00:56:21,683
Don't you dare play any tricks...

1100
00:56:23,723 --> 00:56:26,700
I'm going to call the landlady right away.
Got it?

1101
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,376
Fine. I get it.

1102
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:29,790
Gosh, you're so cheap.

1103
00:56:29,879 --> 00:56:31,137
Get off the car.

1104
00:56:31,872 --> 00:56:32,844
Hold up.

1105
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,770
Why are you holding it?

1106
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:36,705
Let's hold it together.

1107
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:38,163
Are you being suspicious of me right now?

1108
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:39,602
You think I'll run away with this?

1109
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:42,397
I know you'd do more than that.

1110
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,709
Just get out.

1111
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:46,498
How can we both get out
if we both hold it?

1112
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:48,004
Why not?

1113
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,873
I'll just get out from that side as well.

1114
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,297
-Okay, then.
-Yes. After you.

1115
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:55,340
Hey, take it slow.

1116
00:56:55,429 --> 00:56:57,367
-Get out.
-I'm trying...

1117
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,261
Lee Jungi.

1118
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,308
Lee Jungi.

1119
00:57:04,476 --> 00:57:06,220
Come over here you.

1120
00:57:06,309 --> 00:57:07,955
-I told you not to play tricks.
-Stop it.

1121
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:09,625
-Let's hold it together.
-I won't run away.

1122
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:10,935
-Let's hold it together.
-I won't run away.

1123
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:12,588
-Let's hold it together!
-I won't run away.

1124
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:15,156
Do we have to go this far?

1125
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:17,455
People are watching at my meteorite.

1126
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:20,135
You let go, then. I'll take it myself.

1127
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:20,992
As if.

1128
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:22,955
You're not even my friend,
you cheap jerk.

1129
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,587
Then, if we're not friends,
don't talk informally,

1130
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:27,160
Mr. Lee Jungi.

1131
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:29,417
Geez, I'm sorry, Mr. Kook Kibong.

1132
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:31,162
Too bad. The coffee shop is that way.

1133
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:33,735
-No, it's not. It's that way.
-It's this way.

1134
00:57:33,819 --> 00:57:35,052
-It's this way.
-You little...

1135
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:36,850
-You don't believe me?
-Let it go.

1136
00:57:36,939 --> 00:57:38,472
Ouch.

1137
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:40,558
My 2 billion won.

1138
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:41,570
My meteorite.

1139
00:57:42,194 --> 00:57:43,092
No. No!

1140
00:57:43,182 --> 00:57:43,965
No!

1141
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:45,326
My 2 billion won.

1142
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,789
What if it's only worth 1 million now.

1143
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:48,790
Are you okay?

1144
00:57:48,879 --> 00:57:49,941
Are you broken?

1145
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:52,430
Hey, brat.

1146
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:53,968
Hey!

1147
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:57,085
What are you doing?

1148
00:57:58,471 --> 00:57:59,553
What are you doing?

1149
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:09,038
Han Suyeon.

1150
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,399
There she is.

1151
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:23,613
It's really is Suyeon.

1152
00:58:23,702 --> 00:58:26,241
Our first love is getting married.

1153
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,033
This feels strange.

1154
00:58:31,448 --> 00:58:32,370
I know what you mean.

1155
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:34,221
If only one of us really got
to confess our feelings,

1156
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:37,116
we could be standing next to her now.

1157
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:41,387
-Right?
-It could've been me.

1158
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,117
Now, it's time for a congratulatory song.

1159
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:45,919
Please give a big round of applause.

1160
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:54,241
What is that?

1161
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:57,116
What on earth is this?

1162
00:58:57,727 --> 00:58:59,292
What a peculiar congratulatory singer.

1163
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,557
-You are all surprised, right?
-Is this the Masked Singer or what?

1164
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:04,777
Actually, this person is a new singer
who will be debuting soon.

1165
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:07,527
So, he said that he cannot
have his face shown.

1166
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,153
We ask for your understanding.

1167
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:11,692
Well, let's listen to the song.

1168
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:12,639
Please applaud.

1169
00:59:16,315 --> 00:59:19,603
Initially, there is a song
that the couple requested,

1170
00:59:19,692 --> 00:59:21,542
but I do not know that song well,

1171
00:59:21,636 --> 00:59:23,539
so I prepared a different song.

1172
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,094
What are you doing here?

1173
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:28,622
Hi, Suyeon.

1174
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:30,495
Did I surprise you?

1175
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:31,437
Sorry.

1176
01:00:31,993 --> 01:00:33,053
What are you doing, though?

1177
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:34,022
This?

1178
01:00:34,378 --> 01:00:36,493
I'm rearranging the song.
I'll be singing at the concert.

1179
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:37,819
You're performing at a concert?

1180
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:39,067
Can I go watch?

1181
01:00:39,151 --> 01:00:40,551
Yes, of course.

1182
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:41,513
Of course you can.

1183
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:42,682
I'll give you an invitation.

1184
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:43,718
Really?

1185
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:45,178
Thanks.

1186
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:49,324
The next song has been requested
by Han Suyeon from class 2-3.

1187
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:51,526
It's "I love you" by Lee Jaehoon.

1188
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:53,275
I requested this song.

1189
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,987
Wooshik, what do you think
about this song?

1190
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,188
It's nice.

1191
01:00:57,277 --> 01:00:59,212
It's my favorite song.

1192
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:00,503
Oh, really?

1193
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:04,695
Should I practice this song and
sing it for you later?

1194
01:01:04,784 --> 01:01:05,812
Are you serious?

1195
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:07,348
That's a promise, okay?

1196
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:09,710
Promise me.

1197
01:01:57,121 --> 01:02:00,245
I sincerely congratulate you two
on your marriage.

1198
01:02:00,731 --> 01:02:01,983
And to the bride...

1199
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:03,563
...please...

1200
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,813
...be happy.

1201
01:02:07,812 --> 01:02:09,422
Goodbye, Suyeon.

1202
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:10,717
Be happy, Suyeon.

1203
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:13,874
Next... the couple will pay respect
to their parents...

1204
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,847
-...who have raised them.
-Great job. We did it thanks to you.

1205
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:18,797
Here's your money.

1206
01:02:18,881 --> 01:02:19,834
No, thanks.

1207
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:21,347
I kept my promise, so that's enough

1208
01:02:21,431 --> 01:02:22,196
Promise?

1209
01:02:22,285 --> 01:02:23,359
What promise?

1210
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,141
-What about the money?
-Give it to them as a wedding gift.

1211
01:02:30,656 --> 01:02:32,799
It's the masked singer.

1212
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:34,854
We enjoyed your performance.

1213
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:38,242
Kibong. Jungi.

1214
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:39,948
What?

1215
01:02:40,337 --> 01:02:41,177
Who are you?

1216
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:42,528
It's me.

1217
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:45,185
Cha Wooshik, how are you here?

1218
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:46,373
You...

1219
01:02:46,822 --> 01:02:48,437
You're the masked singer
that sang just now?

1220
01:02:48,521 --> 01:02:49,812
Well... About that...

1221
01:02:50,649 --> 01:02:52,117
Why are you guys here?

1222
01:02:52,316 --> 01:02:53,448
What's with that rock?

1223
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,527
Well, the thing is...
This rock...

1224
01:02:57,301 --> 01:02:58,991
Whatever. It's a long story.

1225
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,107
Let's go out and talk.

1226
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:02,018
Yeah, yeah. Let's leave.

1227
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:06,896
Hurry up.

1228
01:03:07,184 --> 01:03:08,112
-What the...
-What...

1229
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,527
What's he doing?

1230
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:13,048
Over there.

1231
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,273
That...
There...

1232
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:16,915
What is this?

1233
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,755
What's going on?

1234
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,685
This scene happens a lot in movies.

1235
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:23,521
Isn't that Suyeon's ex-boyfriend?

1236
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:25,927
Sir, the company went bankrupt.

1237
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,341
Hurry and leave this place.

1238
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:28,802
Get out of here, sir.

1239
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:31,110
-Bankrupt?
-Jungi, what's bankrupt?

1240
01:03:31,195 --> 01:03:32,040
Geez.

1241
01:03:44,185 --> 01:03:46,242
Suyeon, you should go
somewhere safe for now.

1242
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:54,479
My meteorite!

1243
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,112
Why is that your meteorite?
It's my 2 billion won.

1244
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,967
-You promised to split in half.
-My 2 billion.

1245
01:03:59,051 --> 01:04:00,537
-No.
-My 2 billion.

1246
01:04:00,627 --> 01:04:01,974
"2 billion won"?

1247
01:04:02,228 --> 01:04:03,677
What are you talking about?

1248
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:05,477
Let go. Let me go.

1249
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:21,341
Gosh. My phone is completely broken.

1250
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:23,587
My meteorite.

1251
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:25,525
My meteorite.

1252
01:04:25,631 --> 01:04:26,874
My 2 billion won.

1253
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,627
My 2 billion won.

1254
01:04:29,896 --> 01:04:32,872
Who the heck took my 2 billion won?

1255
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:34,407
Who told you to come here with that thing?

1256
01:04:34,491 --> 01:04:36,400
You think we know this would happen?

1257
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:37,680
Wooshik, you jerk.

1258
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:42,228
It's good manners to watch your first love
for the last time as she gets married.

1259
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:44,070
Then, what about you?

1260
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,448
You even sang the congratulatory song
to your first love.

1261
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:48,854
I did that to earn some money.

1262
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:49,792
Whatever. I don't care.

1263
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,076
Our money is gone now.

1264
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:53,186
Let's...

1265
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:54,357
For the last time...

1266
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:57,324
...can we just watch the security footage?
Just once more.

1267
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,268
Once more.

1268
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:01,290
We've already checked it ten times.
What else is there to see? Let's just go.

1269
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:02,982
One last time, please...

1270
01:05:03,071 --> 01:05:05,070
-Give it up.
-One more time...

1271
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:08,361
You never know.

1272
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,879
Hurry up.

1273
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:13,626
Hold on.

1274
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:15,384
Jung...

1275
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:17,753
...wasn't the trunk open earlier?

1276
01:05:17,842 --> 01:05:19,010
I don't know.

1277
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:22,692
It just opens and closes by itself.

1278
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:28,156
I want to go back!

1279
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:31,054
My 2 billion won!

1280
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:35,485
The wedding hall was turned upside down.

1281
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:39,507
They bragged so much
about how rich they were,

1282
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:41,650
but they went bankrupt,
so the creditor came.

1283
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:44,387
It was just a complete chaos.

1284
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:46,747
Lee Jungi, I'm a fool for trusting you.

1285
01:05:46,831 --> 01:05:49,437
-Geez, shut up.
-We lost that 2 billion won...

1286
01:05:49,521 --> 01:05:52,057
It's not your meteorite, it's mine.

1287
01:05:52,141 --> 01:05:54,335
-Stop fighting, you two!
-This useless car.

1288
01:05:54,424 --> 01:05:56,099
-Shut up.
-Will you stop fighting?

1289
01:05:56,193 --> 01:05:59,138
You shut up, too.
We just lost 2 billion. Darn it.

1290
01:06:04,478 --> 01:06:06,854
-Geez. You call this a car?
-It's all wasted.

1291
01:06:06,943 --> 01:06:08,752
It's an automatic door now.

1292
01:06:08,841 --> 01:06:09,913
Darn it.

1293
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,022
Are you okay?

1294
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:14,581
What's wrong with this door?

1295
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,367
Whatever. There's nothing
to steal, anyway.

1296
01:06:20,451 --> 01:06:22,026
-Just get rid of this crappy car!
-Go in.

1297
01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:23,221
Geez.

1298
01:06:23,624 --> 01:06:24,682
This is driving me crazy.

1299
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:26,062
Wait. Hold on.

1300
01:06:26,479 --> 01:06:27,402
What's that noise?

1301
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:28,325
I think it's coming from the car.

1302
01:06:28,414 --> 01:06:29,837
What kind of noise
would come from the car?

1303
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:33,357
You must be going crazy. Crazy.

1304
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:34,807
Shut up. Just go inside.

1305
01:06:34,896 --> 01:06:35,932
Let's go.

1306
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,282
Hey, hey, hey!

1307
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,098
Why does it keep making a noise?

1308
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:41,867
That's odd.

1309
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:13,766
What's wrong?
What is it?

1310
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:14,702
It's...

1311
01:07:15,773 --> 01:07:16,502
Something's in there.

1312
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:18,721
What do you mean?
Let me see.

1313
01:07:18,871 --> 01:07:20,653
You better not be joking
about that meteorite.

1314
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:22,949
I'm traumatized by the meteorite today.

1315
01:07:23,824 --> 01:07:25,597
What could there be in here?

1316
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:05,035
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1317
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,147
We met our first love
for the first time in 10 years.

1318
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:09,042
We should leave a good impression.

1319
01:08:09,131 --> 01:08:10,513
Is this the time to talk
about "first love?"

1320
01:08:10,602 --> 01:08:12,932
-Wooshik.
-That's your girlfriend?

1321
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,977
-Should I just stay the night?
-What?

1322
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:17,057
The landlady is not well, up here.

1323
01:08:17,141 --> 01:08:19,125
She is not well, up here.

1324
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:21,922
-I need to pee really badly.
-Action.

1325
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,237
Are you Bidam?

1326
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:25,667
-You don't need...
-Director. Hold on.

1327
01:08:25,751 --> 01:08:26,947
There are bugs.
It's so dusty.

1328
01:08:27,031 --> 01:08:28,937
Kang Minho, come to your senses.

1329
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:30,497
You're telling me to go there?

1330
01:08:30,581 --> 01:08:32,617
We're stuck.

1331
01:08:32,701 --> 01:08:34,047
What's inside all of this?

1332
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:37,217
-What do you mean? It's all for you.
-These?

1333
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:38,257
Honey.

1334
01:08:38,341 --> 01:08:39,413
I'm sorry.

1335
01:08:39,502 --> 01:08:40,892
There's nothing I can do.

1336
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:41,998
Who is it?

1337
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:44,185
Us? We're Suyeon's first loves.

1338
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:45,236
What about it?
