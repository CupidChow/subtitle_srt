1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,121
It's time for the last question.

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,259
In the story of Hong Gil Dong, what is...

3
00:00:04,348 --> 00:00:08,825
...the organization that he created
in order to provide aid to the poor?

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,922
What is it called again?
I knew the answer.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,762
I know it too.
It's right at the tip of my tongue.

6
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:16,220
An organization started
to provide aid to the poor?

7
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:18,289
-UNICEF!
-What?

8
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:19,706
What?

9
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:22,458
How could Hong Gil Dong
create UNICEF, you idiot?

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,538
Hey, don't even think of answering
and just listen quietly.

11
00:00:26,686 --> 00:00:27,412
Okay?

12
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,342
It's a tough question.
You're treating me like a total fool.

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,288
The answer is...

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,111
Hwal Bin Dang.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,245
You are correct!

16
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:37,651
The 11th Quiz King has
finally been decided!

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,892
Ms. Kim Yeongja has won
a prize of 40 million won.

18
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,229
40 million won?

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,367
Hey.

20
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,225
The prize is 40 million won?

21
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:46,385
You didn't know?

22
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:49,401
That's why everyone's trying so hard
to appear on that quiz show lately.

23
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,650
Really?

24
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,094
Is that so?

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,897
It's time for Suyeon's program.

26
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,901
-Hey, isn't that you?

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,711
No, no.

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,894
-Jaywalking is...
-What is that?

29
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:05,482
...bad for children. Don't do it.

30
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,452
When you cross the road,
you must stand at by crosswalk...

31
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,152
...and look left and right.

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,452
Raise your right hand up high...

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,792
Jungi.

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,440
What on earth is that?

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,149
What was that?

36
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:24,326
What was that? "The Nice Man"?

37
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,402
When did you film that?

38
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,671
It hasn't been long.

39
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,896
I wasn't being cast for anything,

40
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:30,142
and I failed all my auditions.
What was I supposed to do?

41
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,012
Your life is so pitiful too.

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,542
What's wrong with that?
It's educational and nice.

43
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,167
-Right.
-I guess so.

44
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,584
Shall I go take a nap now?

45
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:41,044
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

46
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,250
You jerk.

47
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,371
Lee Jungi!

48
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,922
Swearing is bad. No, no.
Don't do it.

49
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,361
Nice kids shouldn't swear.

50
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:49,892
-No, no.
-I told you to stop.

51
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,062
Stop it!

52
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,025
Jungi.

53
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,361
No, no.

54
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:56,453
Nice kids shouldn't grab their
friends by their collars like that.

55
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:57,801
Come here. Get over here.

56
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,879
Get over here!

57
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:00,978
Come here!

58
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:02,771
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

59
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:10,887
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

60
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,427
It's the Nice Man!

61
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,274
No, no.

62
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,479
Nice kids shouldn't be picky
with their food. No, no.

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,421
Don't be picky when you eat food.

64
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,518
You must eat a balanced diet.

65
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:24,626
Okay?

66
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,214
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

67
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,693
It's the Nice Man!

68
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,470
No, no.

69
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,941
Nice kids should sleep early
and get up early too.

70
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,665
-Okay?
-Okay, Nice Man.

71
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:43,535
To everyone watching
"Fun For Kids TV", did you see?

72
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,182
I hope all of you become
nice kids who always...

73
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,752
behave nicely just like me,
The Nice Man. Okay?

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,454
I'll see you next time!

75
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,626
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

76
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,691
Cut. Okay, good job.

77
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,296
-Good job.
-Good job.

78
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:00,531
Thank you.

79
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,702
-Director, thank you.
-Good job today.

80
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,462
Jungi, take this with you.

81
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:06,254
What is this?

82
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,201
What do you think?

83
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,902
They're fan letters and gifts
from kids all over the country.

84
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,641
You're a total star these days.

85
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:14,971
Come on. I'm just popular among
young kids. I'm not a star.

86
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,664
What are you talking about?

87
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:19,350
Do you know how many celebrities
became stars through kid programs?

88
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,921
Shin Sekyung, Jang Seohee, Cho Yeojeong,
Ki Taeyoung, Kim Sungsoo.

89
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,431
It's countless.

90
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,607
Really?

91
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,353
A star?

92
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,878
"Fun For Kids TV"

93
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,893
How long has it been since
I last got a present?

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,231
What if I really become a star
at this rate?

95
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:39,231
Oh, it's the Nice Man.

96
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,479
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

97
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,694
Hello.

98
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,872
-Do you know me too?
-Of course.

99
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,712
You're the most popular
person at our kindergarten.

100
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:47,657
Really?

101
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,592
BTS, you better watch out.

102
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,881
Mister, can you sign your autograph
on my backpack?

103
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:55,812
Autograph?

104
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,968
Of course I can.

105
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,396
How long has it been since
I last gave out an autograph?

106
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,374
Come here.

107
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:04,091
Let's see.

108
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,172
Lee...

109
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,841
Lee...

110
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,509
Lee...

111
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,313
Lee...

112
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,861
Lee...

113
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,098
Lee...

114
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,340
Lee...

115
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:28,965
Jun...

116
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:32,984
It's Ki...

117
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,865
Ki. There you go.

118
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,950
Thank you.

119
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:39,586
No problem.

120
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:43,220
It's time for the Nice Man to go now.

121
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,341
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

122
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,612
-Okay, I know.
-So these are all...

123
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,371
...letters from your fans?

124
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,004
Yes. I told you already.

125
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,422
Not only are there fan letters,
but if you look in here,

126
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,631
there are cards, spinning tops,
and even slime that I could play with.

127
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,365
It's full of presents.

128
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,724
I'm about to become a star now.

129
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:12,083
Star, my foot.
Stop overreacting.

130
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:13,805
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

131
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:14,851
Goodness.

132
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:17,926
It's Soomi.

133
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:18,861
Soomi?

134
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,271
The girl from the blind date
you went last time?

135
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,335
A blind date?

136
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:23,600
Jungi, you went on a blind date?

137
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,739
Yes. A friend of mine
introduced me to her.

138
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:29,579
Soomi is really cute, sexy,
pretty, and kind.

139
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:31,222
She's my ideal type.

140
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,695
Do you want to see her picture?

141
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:34,530
Forget it. You enjoy it on your own.

142
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,533
Why is she giving me an attitude?

143
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,776
Goodness, there she goes again.

144
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,628
We need to throw out that smoking pipe,
or alpenhorn or whatever it's called.

145
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:50,387
It's seriously so noisy.

146
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,883
Tell me about it.

147
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,326
But why is "Challenge! Quiz King"
not calling back?

148
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,714
-Was I disqualified?
-"Challenge! Quiz King"?

149
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,228
-You really submitted an application?
-Yes.

150
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,913
I'm going to win the prize money
and open Yuri's Kitchen 31.

151
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:04,284
Goodness me.

152
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,533
Even if you're chosen, do you know
how difficult the questions are?

153
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:07,835
You think you're up for it?

154
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,323
Are you looking down on me?

155
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,081
Do you think I'm stupid like you?

156
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,212
Stupid?

157
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,052
Who are you calling stupid?!

158
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,988
You.

159
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,298
Geez. Seriously.

160
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,462
Hello?

161
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,701
Yes, that's me.

162
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,841
What?

163
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,499
Yes. Alright.

164
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,141
What was that about?

165
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,220
It was the broadcasting station. I was
chosen to play in "Challenge! Quiz King".

166
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,150
What?

167
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:34,532
Really?

168
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:35,699
Are you serious?

169
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:36,651
Yes.

170
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,635
This is strange.

171
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,133
I never submitted an application.

172
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:40,821
It's me who did it.

173
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,207
If I applied alone,
the chances would've been narrow,

174
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,581
so I submitted all your names too.

175
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,309
I really didn't expect
one of us would be chosen.

176
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:48,139
This is awesome.
It's unbelievable!

177
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:49,120
Awesome?

178
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:51,232
Yuri, do you think it's time
for you to be happy?

179
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,330
It's Kibong who got chosen.
Kibong!

180
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:54,590
Do you not know Kibong?

181
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,140
Oh, right.

182
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,317
Darn!

183
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:59,271
Why does it have to be this fool
who got chosen?

184
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,145
What?

185
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,204
So why did you submit
the application in my name?

186
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,771
Forget it, I'm not doing it.

187
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,858
That choice isn't up to you.

188
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,373
From now on, you and I are going
to have an intensive training.

189
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,339
-Put down your chopsticks.
-I'm not doing it.

190
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:11,881
-Put them down.
-I'm not...

191
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:13,211
-Hey, wait.
-Put them down.

192
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,281
-That hurts.
-Follow me.

193
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,612
-I said I'm not doing it!
-We don't have time.

194
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,420
Kook Kibong.

195
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:23,520
I know I'm grasping for straws here,

196
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,150
but I have every intention
of teaching you.

197
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,411
So listen up and pay attention.

198
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,361
Understand?

199
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,998
Okay.

200
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:31,212
To start it off, let's warm up,

201
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,958
with easy questions first.

202
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:36,493
"When couples split money
for their dates..."

203
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,972
"or when colleagues pay
for their own meal during team lunch,"

204
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,377
"what is this word called?"

205
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:43,605
I know this word.

206
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:44,836
What was it?

207
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,148
Dirty pay.

208
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,609
What? Dirty pay?

209
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,344
Instead of one guy being cool
and paying for everything,

210
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,891
it's when everyone acts dirty and
cheap and pays individually.

211
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,311
That's why it's called "Dirty pay".

212
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,344
That's "dutch pay".
How could it be dirty pay?

213
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,821
How could you be so stupid?

214
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,998
Let's move on for now.

215
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,439
"During a dispute,
regardless of one's opinion,"

216
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,495
"when someone makes abusive
remarks about another person,"

217
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,915
"what is this word called?"

218
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,295
It's a four-syllable word.

219
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,989
It ends with "attack".

220
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:22,614
Attack?

221
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,541
Pregnancy attack!

222
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:27,655
What? Pregnancy attack?

223
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,451
Yes. There's no attack as
cowardly and cheap as...

224
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,237
...attacking a pregnant woman.

225
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,464
That's why it's called "pregnancy attack".

226
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,631
Why am I even trying to teach you?

227
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,141
I'd rather participate in the Olympics
and win a gold medal.

228
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,617
That might be faster.

229
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:44,652
Shut it.

230
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:46,945
Hello.

231
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,910
Hello. Hello, everyone.

232
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,264
Director, hello.

233
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,575
Lee Jungi,

234
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,583
-what were you thinking?
-What?

235
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,822
Because of you, our website is
being bombarded with complaints.

236
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,026
Complaints?

237
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:00,472
When you crossed the road yesterday,

238
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:02,946
you didn't raise your hand
or look left and right.

239
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,561
A kid who watches our program saw you.

240
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,884
He even posted a complaint
saying he won't watch our show.

241
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:08,808
Really?

242
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:11,435
Don't you know kids all over
the country watch our show?

243
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,209
You should watch your behavior
no matter what you do from now on.

244
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:15,871
This is so frustrating.

245
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,636
I'm sorry, sir.

246
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:21,828
Who was the kid who saw me?

247
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,070
What do you think?

248
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,128
Isn't the interior design
really sophisticated?

249
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,228
Yes.

250
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,082
It is, but...

251
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,531
...how long do we have to do this?

252
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,252
It's time for the next question.

253
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,018
Yuri, how long are you going to do this?

254
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:40,332
-Don't you see me working?
-It's because we don't have time.

255
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,232
Also, did I tell you not to work?

256
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,768
Just keep studying whenever you
have a free time while working.

257
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:45,814
Here's a question.

258
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,698
"What are the three elements of a nation?"

259
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,334
The three elements of a nation?

260
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:53,018
Land, water, and wind?

261
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:55,205
Land, water, and wind, my foot.

262
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,823
Is this about "Captain Planet"?

263
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:57,854
I know, right?

264
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,718
These are the actual three elements.

265
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,542
Rocks, wind...

266
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:02,545
...and women.

267
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,655
What are you talking about?

268
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,228
Rocks, wind and women are
what Jeju Island is known for.

269
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,291
It's called "Samdado" because
it has plenty of the three.

270
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,668
I see, "Samdado".

271
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,687
So that's why the sashimi restaurant in
my neighborhood is called "Jeju Samdado".

272
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:20,396
-Is that restaurant good?
-Their food is amazing.

273
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,345
Really?

274
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,403
Then please send me their address.

275
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,523
If you throw in an option...

276
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,675
How was it?

277
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,555
Does the steak suit your taste?

278
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,404
Yes, it was good.

279
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:35,916
By the way,

280
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,166
why is it so hard to see you these days?

281
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:39,246
The thing is...

282
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:40,934
...I've been very busy with the shoots.

283
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,849
I couldn't really make time.

284
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:44,266
I'm sorry.

285
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:45,781
It's okay.

286
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:47,565
It's work. There's nothing
you can do about it.

287
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:50,434
You have a heart of gold.

288
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,311
That's the Nice Man! Wow.

289
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,259
Mom, that's the Nice Man.

290
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,645
He's the Nice Man.

291
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:57,944
Hi.

292
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,614
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

293
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:05,391
Oh, why didn't you finish your food?

294
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,288
You said that nice kids should always
eat everything on their plates.

295
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,408
This one?

296
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:15,447
This is parsley.
It's just for decoration.

297
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:16,686
It's not meant to be eaten.

298
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:20,379
Still, you told us to eat
everything on our plates.

299
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:23,011
-The Nice Man shouldn't do this.
-What?

300
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:25,678
Okay, all right.

301
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,511
I'll eat it. I'll eat this, okay?

302
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:33,210
It's good.

303
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,661
It's delicious.

304
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:37,681
Why aren't you eating yours?

305
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:38,738
I have to eat it too?

306
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:42,527
Soomi...

307
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,405
...I'm sorry...

308
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:46,172
...but could you please eat it?

309
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,176
Do it for me, please?

310
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,657
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

311
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:09,996
That must've been inconvenient for you.

312
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,589
Nowadays, kids recognize me
everywhere I go.

313
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,277
Unexpected things
happen from time to time.

314
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,580
It's all right.

315
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,692
Thanks for walking me home.

316
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:20,029
I'll head in, then.

317
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:20,990
Okay.

318
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:22,562
Wait a second, Soomi.

319
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:24,578
Are you just heading in like this?

320
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,544
Gosh...

321
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,233
Jungi, you're such a...

322
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,334
I get it.

323
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:31,152
Mom, I'm late because of you.

324
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,584
The Nice Man said all kids
must go to bed at 9 PM.

325
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:58,662
Oh my gosh!

326
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:02,402
What are you doing?
You shocked the hell out of me.

327
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,540
Goodness.

328
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:06,999
The quiz show is tomorrow.

329
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,058
How could you be sleeping?

330
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,219
Did you solve all the questions?

331
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:10,599
I already did!

332
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:11,728
Really?

333
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:14,626
Then...

334
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:16,281
...shall I take a look?

335
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:22,791
"The government organization
that oversees all public relations..."

336
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,543
"...and external communications needs
regarding governmental affairs..."

337
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,791
"...through cultural events,
campaigns, and publications"...

338
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,101
is called YouTube?

339
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,043
Yes, YouTube.

340
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,415
Goodness.

341
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,562
What Archimedes shouted as he was
jumping out of his bathtub was,

342
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:39,070
-"It's hot"? Seriously?
-Should it be, "It's cold"?

343
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,200
How could a person be this ignorant?

344
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,407
I told you that I don't
want to go on that show.

345
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:48,166
I didn't even get to eat anything
because I've been solving the questions.

346
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,991
Yuri, I'm hungry.
Can I have some food first?

347
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,016
You don't have time to eat dinner now.

348
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,487
If you're hungry,

349
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,647
you can eat this.

350
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,887
The new rice cake shop
was giving it out earlier.

351
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:03,501
"Euljimun Rice Cakes"?

352
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:06,019
What an unusual name for a rice cake shop.

353
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:11,816
Euljimun Rice Cakes is good.

354
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,284
Kibong, how are you feeling today?

355
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:19,736
You can do a good job, right?

356
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,258
I don't even know.

357
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,911
What if I end up embarrassing myself?

358
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,904
Stop with the negativity.

359
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:28,836
Kibong, you can do it.

360
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:29,958
Cheer up.

361
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,895
Just go for it. Go for it.

362
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,651
Kibong!

363
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,331
What are you doing?

364
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:42,787
What do you think of this place?

365
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,198
This place...

366
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,752
...is the closest to my dream restaurant.

367
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,577
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

368
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,172
It's small,

369
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:53,162
but I love how cute and cozy it is.

370
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:56,436
If I can actually open Yuri's Kitchen,

371
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:59,017
I'll make sure the kitchen
is in the middle of the restaurant.

372
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,289
That way, the customers can watch
the entire cooking process.

373
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,618
And each table...

374
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,415
...will have a fresh daily-bought flowers.

375
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:09,610
And there will be a small blackboard
in front of the restaurant.

376
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,751
On the blackboard, I'll write down...

377
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,227
"Chef Cha Yuri's
Recommendations of the Day".

378
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,474
Just thinking about it
makes you that happy?

379
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,091
Yes, of course.

380
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:21,278
It's been my lifelong dream.

381
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:25,777
Okay, got it.

382
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:29,286
I'll do my very best today for you,

383
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,908
so just trust me. Me.

384
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,238
Seriously?

385
00:15:34,785 --> 00:15:35,949
You make me proud.

386
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,888
-Yuri, we'll be late. Let's hurry.
-It's so nice.

387
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:40,742
-What?
-Come on.

388
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:41,953
We're not late.

389
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:43,967
We could be late.

390
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:45,837
My gosh, look at you!

391
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,312
Vroom... Vroom... Vroom...
Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

392
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,018
-Jungi.
-Yes, hello.

393
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:54,680
Last night, on the street around 9:30PM,

394
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,816
did you kiss some girl on the street?

395
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:57,858
Sorry?

396
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,309
How did you know...

397
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,352
Someone posted another
complaint on our website.

398
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:03,173
They say The Nice man
told people to sleep by 9PM,

399
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,160
but he was kissing some girl past 9PM.
They were disappointed.

400
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,522
-Seriously?
-Yes.

401
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,991
The kid is bawling, saying she'll
never believe anything you say.

402
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,398
Gosh, when did she see that?

403
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,907
Sir, I'm an adult.

404
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:20,096
I should be allowed to go out after 9PM
and date, shouldn't I?

405
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:21,031
What?

406
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:23,046
Hey, the first Nice Man...

407
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:25,214
...cuffed himself after 9pm.

408
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:26,144
Why?

409
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,214
Because he was worried
he might go out even in his sleep.

410
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:30,084
You need that level of professionalism.

411
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,186
He cuffed himself?

412
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:33,690
-But the thing is...
-Shut it!

413
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,053
Do you not want to be a star?

414
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,120
I do. I want to be...

415
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,705
-...a star!
-Then behave yourself!

416
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:42,533
If this happens again, I'll find your
replacement. Just keep that in mind.

417
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,160
You'll... You'll find my replacement?

418
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:48,877
Gosh, what am I supposed to do?

419
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,904
Why isn't Jungi here yet?
The movie is about to start.

420
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,284
-Soomi!
-My gosh!

421
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,628
Who are you?

422
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:01,472
It's me, Jungi.

423
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,443
Jungi?

424
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,162
I'm sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

425
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:05,919
There were a lot of kids on the way,

426
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,616
so I had to take a longer route
to avoid them.

427
00:17:08,476 --> 00:17:10,122
Why are you wearing
the mask and sunglasses?

428
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,646
Kids recognize me and post weird
complaints on the show's website.

429
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,509
All right.

430
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:16,959
Let's just go.
We'll be late for the movie.

431
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,517
It's the Nice Man!

432
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:24,987
No, I'm not.
I'm not the Nice Man.

433
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,710
You are.

434
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,129
Your voice sounds exactly like his.

435
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:33,791
You told us that we should
never lie to anyone.

436
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:37,334
-I'm going to tell all my friends.
-No, don't.

437
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,243
I was kidding. I was just teasing you.

438
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:45,290
The Nice Man does not lie.

439
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:49,305
I'm a little busy at the moment,
so I should get going.

440
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,365
The Nice Man, wait!

441
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:54,162
Could you please find
this dog's owner first?

442
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,093
What?

443
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:59,603
I'm quite busy at the moment.

444
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:01,287
-Perhaps next time...
-But...

445
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:03,693
...you said we must never...

446
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,673
...walk away from animals
that are in need of help.

447
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,474
How can the Nice Man be like this?

448
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:09,222
Okay, fine.

449
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:10,947
I'll help the dog.

450
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,993
Soomi,

451
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,141
do you mind if we find
the dog's owner?

452
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,117
What about the movie?

453
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:19,602
-We'll watch it another time.
-Forget it!

454
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:20,944
I'm leaving.

455
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,249
Soomi, wait. Soomi.

456
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,752
This is driving me crazy.

457
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:35,503
Jeongeun, you don't
want any fried chicken?

458
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:36,922
I have no appetite.

459
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,195
You seem dispirited these days.

460
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,963
What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

461
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:41,893
What?

462
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,896
No. Nothing happened.

463
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,054
It's starting. I see Kibong there.

464
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,490
Live broadcast of
"Challenge! Quiz King" is back.

465
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,677
First, let me introduce the contestants.

466
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,286
Contestant number one.
A current professor at KAIST,

467
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,831
Mr. Wang Yeongjae.

468
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:00,407
Hello.

469
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,546
Contestant number two
earned his doctorate degree at Harvard,

470
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:06,180
and he currently works at NASA
on a joint Korea-USA project.

471
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:08,011
He's the senior researcher,

472
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,543
Mr. Lee Sooseok.

473
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:10,749
Hello.

474
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:12,682
Lastly, contestant number three.

475
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,627
He is a former professional
baseball player,

476
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:17,028
and now works as a car dealer,

477
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:18,336
Mr. Kook Kibong.

478
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:20,289
Hello!

479
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,407
Harvard and KAIST?

480
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,660
Kibong has to beat those people?

481
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,297
Gosh, that's simply impossible.

482
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:30,829
It's like an amateur soccer player
going up against Ronaldo and Messi.

483
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,099
I feel so bad for Kibong.

484
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,917
Alright. We'll now start
the live broadcast,

485
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,767
of "Challenge! Quiz King".

486
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:39,842
You'll lose points with each wrong answer.

487
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:42,689
So think before you push the buzzer.

488
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:43,975
Here's the first question.

489
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,265
A king's face is called "yongan".

490
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:49,090
A king's tears are called "yongru".

491
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,920
Then what is a king's excrement called?

492
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,251
-Let me answer.
-Wang Youngjae.

493
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,590
-Yongbyeon.
-"Yongbyeon"?

494
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,730
That must be correct.

495
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,000
Incorrect.

496
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,170
You lost 10 points.

497
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:01,942
-Let me answer.
-Lee Sooseok.

498
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:02,869
Wangttong.

499
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,041
"Wangttong"?

500
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,408
Incorrect.

501
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,623
Lee Sooseok lost 10 points as well.

502
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:09,705
Now it's Kook Kibong's turn to answer.

503
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:10,835
What is your answer
Kook Kibong?

504
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:15,737
I choose to pass.

505
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:17,632
He passed the question.

506
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,445
The correct answer is "maehwa".

507
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:21,901
Let's move on to the next question.

508
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:23,722
Let me answer. A black hole.

509
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:24,849
Let me answer. Gahwamansaseong.

510
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:26,648
Incorrect. You lost points.

511
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:28,198
-Kook Kibong.
-Pass.

512
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,237
Pass. Pass.

513
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:30,266
I said, pass.

514
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,290
Pass!

515
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:32,953
Pass! Pass!

516
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:33,975
Pass! Pass!

517
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:34,939
Hey.

518
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,034
Pass!

519
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:39,687
-Pass!
-He passed again.

520
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:41,576
I choose to pass.

521
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,662
He passed yet again.

522
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,814
Let's move on to the next question.

523
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,082
In the satirical novel, "Baebijangjeon",

524
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,449
what did the protagonist, Bae Bijang,

525
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:53,357
give to the gisaeng, Ae Rang,
as a symbol of his love?

526
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,305
-Let me answer.
-Lee Sooseok.

527
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:56,700
-A diamond?
-Incorrect.

528
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,116
Let me answer. A tip?

529
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,065
A "tip"?

530
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,395
Tip?

531
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:01,398
Tip...

532
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,827
...is incorrect.

533
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,900
You lost 20 more points.

534
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,037
This is the last question
of the preliminary round,

535
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,436
and it is Kook Kibong's turn to answer.

536
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:09,476
Kook Kibong.

537
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:19,111
I will pass.

538
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,604
He even passed the last question.

539
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:23,737
With that,

540
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,802
Kook Kibong passed all the questions,
and his score is still zero.

541
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:29,080
Therefore, he moves on...

542
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:30,613
...to the final round!

543
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:35,113
Let's go! I can do this!

544
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:36,831
Yuri.

545
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:41,955
"Kook Kibong goes to the final round!"

546
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:45,529
What just happened?

547
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,694
Is Kibong really going to the final round?

548
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,279
That's impossible.

549
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,176
What happened to Soomi?

550
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,469
She won't pick up her phone,
and she's not home either.

551
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:13,707
Soomi.

552
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:16,264
Jungi.

553
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:21,864
Who's this guy?

554
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,830
Dating you is too hard for me.
I can't do it anymore.

555
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,366
Still, you can't do this
without saying anything to me.

556
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:30,467
Why don't you stop?

557
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,059
Why is a man acting so low?

558
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:32,994
What?

559
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,090
Low?

560
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:37,038
You jerk. Are you done now?

561
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:39,892
-How can you do this?
-What are you doing?

562
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:40,830
Who are you?

563
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,057
Let's go.

564
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:43,797
Oh, that's the Nice Man.

565
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:46,598
-Hi, Nice Man.
-It's the Nice Man.

566
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:48,907
Nice Man, what are you doing right now?

567
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:50,489
Don't tell me you're fighting.

568
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,812
You told us that friends
need to be nice to each other.

569
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:00,791
Oh, well...

570
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:02,506
The thing is...

571
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,560
This is driving me crazy.

572
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,020
What if I fight in front of
these kids and get fired?

573
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:11,248
But it's not right
if I just walk away from here.

574
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:13,733
What should I do?

575
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:15,016
That's right.

576
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:17,298
Soomi.

577
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,861
No, no.

578
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:22,190
-No, no.
-No, no.

579
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,690
A nice grown-up shouldn't go
on a date with another man...

580
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,697
...behind her boyfriend's back.

581
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,641
And you, whatever your name is!

582
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:31,931
You shouldn't do this either.

583
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,657
No, no.

584
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,141
-No, no.
-No, no.

585
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:40,341
A nice grown-up shouldn't steal
another man's girlfriend.

586
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,575
It's a very low and cowardly thing to do.

587
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:45,899
Okay.

588
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:48,080
I have to go now.

589
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:51,253
I hope you two live happily together...

590
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,864
...until you go senile.

591
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:54,869
Excuse me now.

592
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,494
Nice Man, you can't leave yet.

593
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,774
You forgot to do that.

594
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:01,140
That thing?

595
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:12,073
-Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.
-Vroom... Vroom... Nice Man.

596
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:14,508
-Bye!
-Bye!

597
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,606
All right, Kook Kibong.

598
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:18,115
By winning the preliminary round,

599
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:20,120
you won 5 million won.

600
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,584
If you decide to go on
to the final round...

601
00:24:22,673 --> 00:24:25,615
...and get all three questions right...

602
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:28,209
...you'll win the final prize of...

603
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,190
...40 million won.

604
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,230
"Prize money 40 million won"

605
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,156
However,

606
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:33,891
if you get a single question wrong,

607
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:37,484
you lose all your prize money.

608
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:39,174
Kook Kibong...

609
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:41,914
-...would you like to stop here?
-Quit.

610
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:43,010
Quit, Kibong.

611
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:46,158
Or would you like to challenge
the final round of Quiz King?

612
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:47,639
It's beyond your ability.

613
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,145
That's right. Don't do it, Kibong.

614
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,600
Just give up.

615
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:52,377
Would you like to take the challenge?

616
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:53,756
Kibong.

617
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,131
It's a miracle that
you've made it this far.

618
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,023
You have to stop now.

619
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,483
Don't do it!

620
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,077
I'd like to...

621
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:06,505
No!

622
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:16,316
...challenge it!

623
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:20,279
He wants to go on.

624
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:21,522
He's crazy.

625
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,950
Why? Why? Why?

626
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,543
Why the heck did you do that?

627
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,273
Yuri...

628
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:30,797
...you can count on me.

629
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,290
I'll be the Quiz King...

630
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:36,358
...and buy you a restaurant.

631
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:39,412
Would you look at that.

632
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:42,425
What on earth is he thinking?

633
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,657
All right. Here's the first question.

634
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:51,769
Jeju Island is known to have
no thieves, beggars, or gates...

635
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,526
...hence the nickname, "Sammudo".

636
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,980
At the same time, Jeju Island
has plenty of three things,

637
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:01,496
which gives it its nickname, "Samdado".

638
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:04,432
What are these three things?

639
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,637
I don't know.

640
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:08,381
I have absolutely no idea.

641
00:26:08,684 --> 00:26:11,331
What is "Sammudo" and "Samdado"?

642
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,178
Wait.

643
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:14,792
"Samdado"?

644
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:18,071
Rocks, wind, and women are
what Jeju Island is known for.

645
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:20,885
It's called "Samdado" because
it has plenty of the three.

646
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,723
I have the answer!

647
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,437
Rocks...

648
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:27,444
...wind...

649
00:26:27,593 --> 00:26:28,435
...and women.

650
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:29,780
Correct!

651
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:30,590
Nice!

652
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:31,611
Yes!

653
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,838
Kibong gave his first
answer, and it was correct.

654
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,081
How did Kibong know that?

655
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:36,233
I know, right?

656
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:37,591
I guess he got lucky.

657
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,740
-How could they ask about that?
-All right.

658
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:41,261
Here's the second question.

659
00:26:41,938 --> 00:26:45,612
This is the world's longest
woodwind instrument.

660
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:48,030
Originally used by the
shepherds in the Alps,

661
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,985
it's a traditional Swiss instrument.

662
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:55,043
What is the name of the
instrument in the picture?

663
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:57,342
I've seen that a lot somewhere.

664
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,880
That's what Jeongeun was playing.

665
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,626
What was its name?

666
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,023
I have the answer!

667
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,175
Alpenhorn.

668
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:09,547
"Alpenhorn".

669
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,051
It's correct!

670
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:12,051
I don't believe this.

671
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,690
-Nice!
-This question was pretty hard.

672
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:15,795
Unbelievable.

673
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,760
They asked him about the alpenhorn.

674
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,700
If he gets just one more question right,

675
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,601
does he become the Quiz King?

676
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,901
Kook Kibong now only has to get...

677
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:28,861
one more question right
to win 40 million won.

678
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:31,127
Here is the last question.

679
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,410
When the Sui general Yu Zhongwen,

680
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:35,120
and his army of 30,000 troops,

681
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,750
invaded Goguryeo,

682
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:41,180
he was ridiculed by a poem written by,

683
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:44,750
Goguryeo's greatest war hero. Who is this?

684
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:46,078
I don't know.

685
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:47,744
I don't have the slightest idea.

686
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,682
I've never heard about anything
like this in my whole life.

687
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:54,092
Kook Kibong seems to be trying
to remember the name.

688
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:56,206
There's a hint on the screen.

689
00:27:56,501 --> 00:28:01,307
Who is the person in the portrait
on the screen?

690
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:02,890
Wait a second.

691
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:05,020
I've seen this portrait somewhere.

692
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:07,658
What an unusual name for a rice cake shop.

693
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:10,911
That one!

694
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:11,995
I have the answer!

695
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:17,584
Euljimun Rice Cakes.

696
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:20,763
"Rice Cakes"?

697
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:23,219
Can you say it again more precisely?

698
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,012
I was sure it was "Euljimun Rice Cakes".

699
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:27,972
Is it wrong?

700
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,463
Then what could it be?

701
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:30,534
Kibong.

702
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:31,907
Kibong.

703
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:34,565
It's not "tteok" as in rice cake.
But "deok".

704
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:37,322
"Deok" as in duck.

705
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,581
A duck.
Quack, quack.

706
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,261
Quack, quack. A duck.

707
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,567
Quack, quack.
Quack, quack.

708
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:45,428
I have the answer.

709
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:47,170
Euljimun Quack.

710
00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:50,266
"Quack"? Did you say "Euljimun Quack"?

711
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,197
All right.

712
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll give you three more seconds.

713
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:54,445
One.

714
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:55,890
I have the answer!

715
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,260
Euljimun Duck.

716
00:28:57,348 --> 00:28:58,430
No?

717
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,959
Euljimun Mallard.

718
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:02,500
40 million won...

719
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:03,571
Euljimun...

720
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,518
No.

721
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:06,371
Euljimun Donald Duck!

722
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:07,903
You idiot! That stupid little...

723
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,649
Why did you even try?

724
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,173
Yuri...

725
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,526
...I'm sorry.

726
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,387
-I'm really sorry.
-Shut up.

727
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,490
What? "Euljimun Quack"?

728
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,131
"Euljimun Mallard"?

729
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,614
"Euljimun Donald Duck"?

730
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:34,550
You were saying, "quack, quack".
That's why I thought...

731
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,059
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

732
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:42,529
I promise I'll help you
open your restaurant later.

733
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:46,081
I'm a man who always keeps his word.

734
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,934
"A man's word is worth
his weight in installments."

735
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:48,877
You know that, right?

736
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,408
What? A man's word is worth
his weight in installments?

737
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:53,307
Yes.

738
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:56,538
It means a man's words are as
important as paying installments.

739
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:59,759
When you sign a contract, do you
know how important installments are?

740
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:02,491
If you don't pay that,
your contract will be terminated.

741
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,292
You lunatic.

742
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:07,709
What? What's wrong?

743
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:08,842
Hey.

744
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:11,794
I can't stand this any longer.

745
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:13,706
Don't come near me. I'm sorry.

746
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,303
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

747
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,170
Yuri, I'm sorry. Don't come near me!

748
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:19,094
Hey, wait. Yuri!

749
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:24,710
Why does the producer
suddenly want to see us?

750
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:27,585
What if he asks us to buy tickets
to his sister's recital again?

751
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,370
I have a bad feeling.

752
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,581
Good morning.

753
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,163
-Hello.
-Good morning.

754
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:34,561
Producer, why did you
ask us to gather here?

755
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,586
Actually, my book is finally out today.

756
00:30:36,719 --> 00:30:38,645
I wanted to give it
to each of you as gifts.

757
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:40,718
Here you go.

758
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:42,119
Wow!

759
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:44,321
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

760
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:46,765
I can't just get this for free.

761
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:48,770
I'll buy this. Give me 10 books.

762
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:49,902
I'll take 20.

763
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:52,986
I didn't call you for this.
You guys are so generous.

764
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,924
-Suyeon, how many do you want?
-Sorry?

765
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:57,323
I don't need any.

766
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:59,351
I'm not interested in famous restaurants.

767
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,555
I see, you're not interested.

768
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:02,807
Too bad then.

769
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,806
Suyeon, let me see your
script for this reporting.

770
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:07,291
Oh, okay.

771
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:10,750
Here you go.

772
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,501
What's wrong?

773
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,230
You don't like my script?

774
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:21,401
This isn't interesting or touching at all.

775
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:22,873
It's a total mess.

776
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,903
What's wrong with the spelling?

777
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,136
Look. It's "family picnic",
not family picnik.

778
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:32,098
It's also "fun activities",
not "fun activitys".

779
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,851
I'm sorry, I've made a mistake.

780
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,059
This isn't a mistake.

781
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:37,320
Even elementary school students know this.

782
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:40,161
How could you be worse than my
10-year-old nephew at spelling?

783
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:42,661
How could this guy speak so obnoxiously?

784
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:45,361
Not only is your pronunciation inaccurate,

785
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,361
but you'll have to study
spelling from the beginning.

786
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,386
I just want to sew that mouth shut...

787
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:51,748
What are you doing?

788
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:55,168
It's nothing.

789
00:31:58,358 --> 00:31:59,361
I want to check things.

790
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:21,885
-Wow.
-This is amazing!

791
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:25,718
It's really delicious.

792
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,524
I know. It fits my taste perfectly.

793
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,188
-You haven't lost your touch.
-Really?

794
00:32:31,277 --> 00:32:33,481
Then do you think
Yuri's Kitchen 31 will be a success?

795
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,813
What is Yuri's Kitchen 31?

796
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:36,524
I've decided the concept as...

797
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:39,657
...31 types of spaghetti
that's fun to choose.

798
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:41,774
I've decided the name of this
as "Mom is a Spaghetti Alien".

799
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:43,160
What do you think? Isn't it unique?

800
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:45,430
Hang on. Yuri's Kitchen 31?

801
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,744
"Mom is a Spaghetti Alien"?

802
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:48,812
That sounds strangely familiar.

803
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:50,996
Don't tell me the other
spaghetti names are...

804
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,557
"Very Berry Spaghetti" or
"Almond Vongole". Are they?

805
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:56,786
That's trade secret.

806
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:00,690
Anyway,

807
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,840
what's the point of making new menus?

808
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:05,609
I don't even have a restaurant.

809
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,579
Only if he answered
those questions right,

810
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:10,105
everything would have been solved.

811
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:12,560
Gosh, this is so yummy.

812
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,436
-Why aren't you eating?
-I don't have an appetite.

813
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:18,042
Just leave her be.
There isn't enough for me anyway.

814
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,585
Do you even have an appetite
after being so pathetically dumped?

815
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:21,577
Hey!

816
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:24,290
I told you not to talk about Soomi.

817
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,131
Also, I wasn't dumped. I dumped her.

818
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,770
How many times do I have to tell you?

819
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,424
What? Did you break up
with your girlfriend?

820
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:33,489
Yes.

821
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,886
I see.

822
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:39,733
I thought you had no appetite.

823
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:42,996
Excuse me.

824
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:45,914
Where is the ATM near here?

825
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,179
Oh, an ATM?

826
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,690
If you go out and turn right,
you'll find it nearby.

827
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,641
Okay.

828
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:51,852
Thank you.

829
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:57,161
Hey, that guest.

830
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:59,260
Doesn't he have a strange vibe about him?

831
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:02,228
-Something seems grim about him.
-I don't know. I didn't feel anything.

832
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:03,581
Really?

833
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:09,529
Whatever. Anyway, is there
a way I can make money?

834
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:13,081
Dear Almighty, if you
have any money to spare,

835
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,141
can you throw it down at me? Please?

836
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:27,720
How did Jungi know about
"Very Berry Spaghetti"...

837
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:29,615
and "Almond Vongole"?

838
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:31,374
He totally read my mind.

839
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:33,977
Wait.

840
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,038
What is that?

841
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,097
For rent?

842
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:40,919
What? This shop must be leasing.

843
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:44,544
A down payment of 40 million won
and monthly rent of 3 million won?

844
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,358
Gosh, that's so expensive.

845
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,340
What use is it if this
place is out for rent?

846
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:51,991
I can't afford it.

847
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:58,893
What is that?

848
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,704
"Wanted fraud artist"
40 million won?

849
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:04,805
The reward money is 40 million won?

850
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:09,750
If only I can catch him,
I can afford my restaurant.

851
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,030
"Wanted fraud artist,
Kim Chuljung"

852
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:15,014
But why does he look so familiar?

853
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:19,740
Where is the ATM near here?

854
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:20,901
"Wanted fraud artist,
Kim Chuljung"

855
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:31,217
What do you think?
Doesn't he look like that guest we saw?

856
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:35,220
I'm not sure.
He does seem similar in a way,

857
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:37,260
but he seems different too.

858
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:39,759
But he has a mustache and wears glasses.

859
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:43,358
He can just shave his mustache
and not wear glasses.

860
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:44,427
In order not to get caught.

861
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:45,536
You're right.

862
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:48,771
Come to think of it, he does look similar.

863
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:50,501
I'm certain it's him.

864
00:35:51,328 --> 00:35:53,573
Gosh, I'm so lucky.

865
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,977
If I get the 40 million won
I'll be able to open Yuri's Kitchen.

866
00:35:58,299 --> 00:35:59,237
What?

867
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:01,786
You're going to open your
restaurant by turning him in?

868
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,099
Of course.

869
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:05,128
I'll report him to the police right now.

870
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,373
Yuri, are you insane?

871
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:08,621
How could you report him
when you're not even sure?

872
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:11,890
If you're wrong, he'll sue us
for making false accusations.

873
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:14,066
-Really?
-Of course.

874
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:16,607
Then...

875
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:18,601
...I have no choice.

876
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,158
I'll have to check.

877
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:21,041
How?

878
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,311
You can't make him wear glasses
or put a mustache on his face.

879
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,056
There's always a way.

880
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,396
I'm telling you, just trust me.

881
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,604
Me.

882
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:36,182
You all did a great job
shooting on the weekend.

883
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,950
You did great too, Producer.

884
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:41,647
Shouldn't we throw a welcome
party for Suyeon?

885
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:42,589
A welcome party?

886
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,791
She's not even an official reporter.
What for?

887
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:46,891
Still, we should throw her a party.

888
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,149
Okay. Fine.

889
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,494
Suyeon, what do you like?

890
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,053
I like meat.

891
00:36:52,158 --> 00:36:53,572
This is meat?

892
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,879
Why? You don't consider
chicken feet as meat?

893
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:59,009
I thought Suyeon was only bad at Korean,

894
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:00,547
but she also have bad common sense.

895
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:02,180
Let's all have a drink.

896
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:03,320
Cheers.

897
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:04,687
Cheers.

898
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,050
Excuse me.

899
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:10,096
Yes, hello?

900
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:11,316
What?

901
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,044
Okay.

902
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:17,728
Producer, the main writer needs us,
so we should get going.

903
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,750
-What should we do?
-You've got no choice then.

904
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:20,900
I'm sorry, Suyeon.

905
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,290
-Let's do this another time.
-Okay.

906
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,600
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

907
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:28,501
Shall we go too?

908
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:29,524
Why?

909
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:31,050
You don't want to drink with me?

910
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:35,003
-No, it's not that...
-Oh, you can't drink?

911
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:38,719
Suyeon, you're bad at Korean,

912
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:40,120
have bad common sense,

913
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:41,462
and can't even drink.

914
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:43,639
-What is it that you're good...
-Fine.

915
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,816
Let's drink.

916
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,007
I'll drink with you.

917
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,415
-Satisfied?
-You should've toasted first.

918
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,164
You even have bad drinking manners.

919
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:06,922
Ta-da!

920
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:09,297
What are you doing?

921
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,735
Congratulations. You're the winner...

922
00:38:11,824 --> 00:38:14,481
...of our guest house's
one-year anniversary event.

923
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:15,630
Event?

924
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:19,434
The prize for the one-year
anniversary event...

925
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,572
-...is just three bottles of beer?
-Sorry?

926
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,574
If you want, I can give you
a couple more bottles.

927
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:29,783
But isn't it boring to
just drink like this?

928
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:31,458
Do you want to play a game?

929
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:33,159
-How about a word relay?
-Word relay?

930
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:35,865
Yes. And to make things more interesting,

931
00:38:35,954 --> 00:38:37,609
let's draw on the loser's face.

932
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,180
You know, like drawing
a mustache and glasses.

933
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:42,311
-Doesn't it sound fun?
-No, I don't want...

934
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:43,745
I'll go first then.

935
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,201
-Singer.
-An R?

936
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,680
You have to answer within three seconds.

937
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:49,261
3, 2...

938
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,150
-Rabbit.
-Rabbit? T?

939
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:54,627
The first game was just practice.

940
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:57,930
Then let's begin the real game now.

941
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:00,592
Since you won, go first.

942
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:01,670
Okay.

943
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,779
Telephone.

944
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:04,651
E?

945
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:06,855
-Earth.
-H?

946
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:09,010
H...

947
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:10,487
-Habbit.
-T?

948
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:12,217
T? T...

949
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:15,239
This was a warm-up game.

950
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:17,212
Since we're all warmed up,

951
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,938
let's really begin the real game now.

952
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,152
All right.

953
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,722
-Peach.
-H?

954
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:26,225
-Happiness.
-S?

955
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,480
S...? S...

956
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,769
-What starts with a S?
-You have three seconds.

957
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:35,101
3, 2...

958
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:36,751
-Split?
-T?

959
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:39,130
Goodness. I knew you
were too overconfident.

960
00:39:39,218 --> 00:39:40,998
You got what you deserved.

961
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:43,710
That man is an expert at that game.

962
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,570
He's incredibly smart.
I'm sure he's a con man.

963
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:48,908
Is everyone who's good at that game
considered a con man?

964
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:51,050
It's not confimed, so give up already.

965
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,042
No, I can't give up.

966
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:54,805
To open Yuri's Kitchen 31,

967
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,557
I need that cash reward.

968
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,421
I'll prove it no matter what.

969
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,359
At all costs.

970
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:03,446
Goodness, no one can stop you.

971
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:06,388
Wipe that off your face first.

972
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,516
I'd like to,

973
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:11,226
but this is a permanent maker
so it won't come off.

974
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:13,780
Why did you use a permanent marker?

975
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,038
That's all we have at home,
so I had no choice!

976
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,200
This jerk. I'll teach him a lesson.

977
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:20,780
What are you going to do now?

978
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:22,598
Yuri! Yuri!

979
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:32,082
Gosh, why can't I eat this?

980
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,291
Suyeon, you're quite drunk.

981
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:35,545
Me?

982
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,533
I'm not drunk.

983
00:40:38,797 --> 00:40:39,949
I'm totally shober.

984
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:43,360
It's not "shober", it's 'sober'.

985
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,623
Gosh, how could you be bad at Korean?

986
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:50,570
This jerk. There he goes again.

987
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:55,211
I can't believe you want to
be a reporter. Goodness.

988
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,785
Stop it already.

989
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,553
Han Suyein, your pronunciation is bad.

990
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:00,921
You can't even spell,

991
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,880
and you don't have good drinking manners.

992
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:05,291
Is there anything that you can do?

993
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,360
Enough, you jerk!

994
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:08,921
Did you just slap me?

995
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,130
That's right. I did.
What are you going to do about it?

996
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,539
With that chicken foot?

997
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,300
You're being like this because
I didn't buy your book, right?

998
00:41:16,388 --> 00:41:18,070
I know that's why you're
doing this, you loser.

999
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:19,731
And stop acting like you know everything.

1000
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:23,441
Your mouth is the problem.
This mouth of yours.

1001
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:25,129
Get a taste of this.

1002
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,638
You're just a lame loser. You little...

1003
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,394
Don't you get cheeky with me.

1004
00:41:33,232 --> 00:41:34,882
Geez, I feel so much better now.

1005
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:51,349
What is it now?

1006
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,101
Congratulations.

1007
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:55,240
You've been chosen to participate
in our special event celebrating...

1008
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:56,570
...the Year of the Golden Pig.

1009
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:59,271
What? An event celebrating
the Year of the Golden Pig?

1010
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,019
Yes, that's right!

1011
00:42:01,108 --> 00:42:04,480
The prize is a voucher for a
free night at our guesthouse.

1012
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:06,522
We'll play a game.
You'll get it if you win.

1013
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:07,699
If you lose,

1014
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,148
I'll draw on your face.

1015
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:13,577
Cham... Cham... Cham!

1016
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:18,766
Cham...

1017
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,489
Cham...

1018
00:42:25,248 --> 00:42:26,110
Cham!

1019
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:33,713
All right! This time, the
prize is a voucher...

1020
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:35,280
...for a free week at our guesthouse.

1021
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:39,213
Let's begin the game celebrating the
one-year anniversary of our renovation.

1022
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:43,134
Dibi dibi dib!

1023
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,487
Okay.

1024
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:49,024
Dibi dibi...

1025
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:52,294
...dib!

1026
00:42:54,974 --> 00:42:57,188
Darn it. This is driving me ccrazy.

1027
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:02,937
"Idiot"
There's no space left on your face.

1028
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:04,371
How could you not even win once?

1029
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,441
He's like the master of all games.

1030
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:07,711
He's good at every game.

1031
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:09,240
From rock-paper-scissors to stone game ,

1032
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:11,450
we played all sorts of games,
but he won every single time.

1033
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:13,321
No one told you to waste
your time like this.

1034
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,795
-You're not even sure.
-Shut up!

1035
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:17,715
By the way,

1036
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,391
how can I beat him?

1037
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:21,458
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1038
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,687
Just forget it.
Don't do anything.

1039
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:25,451
-I'll give it a shot.
-Hey.

1040
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,061
Even I couldn't beat him.

1041
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,130
How is an idiot like you
going to win against him?

1042
00:43:29,218 --> 00:43:31,001
I'll suggest a game that
uses physical strength.

1043
00:43:31,089 --> 00:43:32,792
Like arm or foot wrestling, for example.

1044
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:34,501
I'm a strong guy, you know.

1045
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:37,135
So just trust me. Me.

1046
00:43:38,258 --> 00:43:40,401
All right, then. Shall I go and see?

1047
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:52,337
He's strong.

1048
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:53,661
"Fool"
He's incredibly strong.

1049
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:54,541
Seriously?

1050
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:56,590
How could someone be like that?

1051
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:59,056
Gosh, you two are such amateurs.

1052
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:01,111
You can't win because
you're going by the book.

1053
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,268
What are you talking about?

1054
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:03,516
If we can't beat him 1-on-1,

1055
00:44:04,138 --> 00:44:05,631
2 of us can go up against him together.

1056
00:44:06,306 --> 00:44:08,710
He won't be able to beat us
if two of us go at him.

1057
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:09,831
Jeongeun,

1058
00:44:10,807 --> 00:44:11,565
let's go.

1059
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:12,530
Me?

1060
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:15,234
You just have to follow my lead.

1061
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,502
All right, then. Shall we go?

1062
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,614
What the...

1063
00:44:36,198 --> 00:44:37,570
"Loser"
Even two people can't beat him.

1064
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:39,179
He really is the master of all games.

1065
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:41,107
He's a pro gamer. He's a genius.

1066
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:41,918
"Dumpling"

1067
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,264
You said you could beat him.

1068
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:45,520
Gosh.

1069
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,311
Hello.

1070
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:52,180
Hello, I got a call that
my friend is here, all drunk.

1071
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:53,951
Oh, she's over there.

1072
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,004
Suyeon.

1073
00:45:00,093 --> 00:45:01,133
Suyeon, wake up.

1074
00:45:06,447 --> 00:45:08,300
Why did you drink so much?

1075
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:09,240
What?

1076
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,231
They wanted to throw
a welcome party for me.

1077
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,700
That's why we drank a little.

1078
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:15,056
I see.

1079
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:19,160
By the way, why is there so
much sauce around his mouth?

1080
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:20,216
Oh, you're right.

1081
00:45:20,738 --> 00:45:22,250
I wonder if something happened...

1082
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:25,323
What?

1083
00:45:25,412 --> 00:45:26,889
You slapped his mouth?

1084
00:45:26,978 --> 00:45:28,059
With chicken feet?

1085
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:29,177
Yes.

1086
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,347
I couldn't help it because
he was being so mean to me.

1087
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,024
What should I do, Wooshik?

1088
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:35,820
He'll hold a grudge and retaliate.

1089
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:37,291
What if I get fired?

1090
00:45:37,379 --> 00:45:38,620
My gosh...

1091
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:42,168
I fell asleep.

1092
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,200
Who are you?

1093
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:44,939
Sorry?

1094
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:47,305
He's my friend.

1095
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:48,371
He came to pick me up.

1096
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:50,314
I see.

1097
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:51,901
Gosh, it stings!

1098
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,692
My lips... Why do they hurt so much?

1099
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:57,652
What is all this?

1100
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,968
Why do I have this sauce all over my lips?

1101
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,842
Suyeon, did something happen?

1102
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:04,744
I don't remember anything.

1103
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:08,405
You really don't remember anything?

1104
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:09,800
No,

1105
00:46:10,138 --> 00:46:12,388
I black out often when I drink.

1106
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:14,067
What on earth happened...

1107
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:16,171
Hold on.

1108
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,641
I think someone slapped
my mouth with chicken feet.

1109
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:25,423
My memory is all blurry...

1110
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:29,435
What do I do? I guess he
remembers what happened.

1111
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:32,650
He said he blacks out easily.

1112
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:35,812
Producer,

1113
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:37,699
how about another drink with me?

1114
00:46:38,738 --> 00:46:41,209
Goodness, I finally wiped it all off.

1115
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:43,403
By the way,

1116
00:46:43,686 --> 00:46:45,579
how are we
going to find out who he really is?

1117
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,430
Yuri! Yuri!

1118
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:49,130
What is it? What's with all the fuss?

1119
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:51,130
That man just checked out.

1120
00:46:51,218 --> 00:46:52,956
He left saying something
urgent has come up.

1121
00:46:53,045 --> 00:46:56,381
What? Has he figured out that
we're suspicious of him?

1122
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:57,896
Darn it.

1123
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:59,042
My 40 million won.

1124
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,599
-Wait up!
-Where are you going?

1125
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:03,718
Hey!

1126
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:12,268
Taxi! Taxi!

1127
00:47:12,357 --> 00:47:14,596
Over here. Taxi. Yes, here!

1128
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,971
Taxi!

1129
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,873
Gosh, why is it so hard to hail a taxi?

1130
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,201
Wait!

1131
00:47:26,487 --> 00:47:29,111
-What's going on?
-Where are you going to?

1132
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:31,658
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

1133
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:33,761
Let's have a quick chat
before you go anywhere.

1134
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,617
I'm in a rush now.

1135
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:36,826
Taxi!

1136
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,262
Where do you think you're going?

1137
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:39,570
Guys, get him.

1138
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,862
Let go. What are you guys doing now?

1139
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,932
I have to go. No, don't open it!

1140
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,972
-Stay still!
-No, don't open it!

1141
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,420
-What is this?
-A mask!

1142
00:47:47,928 --> 00:47:49,621
-A knife!
-Don't touch my stuff!

1143
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:51,953
-What? Ropes?
-I knew it.

1144
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:53,813
-Let go!
-A wig!

1145
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,025
Something's definitely fishy.

1146
00:47:55,114 --> 00:47:56,633
Guys, don't let him go.

1147
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,602
What on earth is this about?

1148
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,602
Hey.

1149
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,031
No, no. Don't.

1150
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,235
Don't move.

1151
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,294
Pardon? He's not the guy?

1152
00:48:05,732 --> 00:48:07,181
That can't be.

1153
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:08,607
Look at this.

1154
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:10,041
He looks just like this man.

1155
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,542
I told you that we caught
that guy a few days ago.

1156
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,596
That's impossible.

1157
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,312
Open his bag.

1158
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,949
You'll find a knife, a wig,
a mask, and so on.

1159
00:48:19,038 --> 00:48:20,551
There are many weird things in it.

1160
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,312
Weird things? Like what?

1161
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:25,583
-You mean, this?
-Look!

1162
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,736
This is for magic tricks.

1163
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,026
Magic tricks?

1164
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,612
I work as a recreation instructor.

1165
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,772
-I sometimes do some magic tricks.
-What?

1166
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:49,713
You're a recreation instructor?

1167
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:52,657
So that's why he's so good at games.

1168
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,740
He did seem like an expert.

1169
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:57,070
I know. No wonder we lost every time.

1170
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:58,588
Whatever!

1171
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:00,929
You did this to my face,

1172
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,149
and make me miss a gig.
What are you going to do?

1173
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:04,638
I'm sorry.

1174
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:08,846
We'll make sure to compensate you, sir.

1175
00:49:09,477 --> 00:49:10,730
I'm really sorry.

1176
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,298
This is so embarrassing.

1177
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,235
It's all your fault.

1178
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:21,801
I know. We lost our money and
made a fool of ourselves.

1179
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,754
I'm sorry.

1180
00:49:23,843 --> 00:49:25,410
I didn't do that on purpose.

1181
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,509
Sir, why are you taking that off?

1182
00:49:32,598 --> 00:49:35,023
What? This place got leased today.

1183
00:49:35,112 --> 00:49:37,078
It's a nice spot, so it's high in demand.

1184
00:49:41,341 --> 00:49:42,871
Don't be too disheartened.

1185
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,984
We'll find another spot.

1186
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:46,408
There's no point.

1187
00:49:47,078 --> 00:49:48,603
I don't have any money anyway.

1188
00:49:50,229 --> 00:49:51,284
Let's go.

1189
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:01,559
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1190
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,593
-By the way, who are you?
-Me?

1191
00:50:06,057 --> 00:50:08,624
I'm Suyeon's friend.

1192
00:50:09,162 --> 00:50:10,274
Don't you remember?

1193
00:50:10,363 --> 00:50:13,163
-No, I don't.
-Good. You forgot everything.

1194
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,487
Whoever you are,

1195
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,146
-let's drink.
-Okay.

1196
00:50:20,048 --> 00:50:21,175
What's going on?

1197
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:22,879
Suyeon, are you sleeping?

1198
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:24,878
Suyeon. Suyeon!

1199
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:26,239
Gosh. Oh my god!

1200
00:50:27,017 --> 00:50:29,623
Why did you have to yell?

1201
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,291
-You surprised the heck out of me.
-My goodness.

1202
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:35,448
I surprised the "heck" out of you?

1203
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:39,391
How can someone who wants
to be a reporter use such language?

1204
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,732
You think that's acceptable?

1205
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,678
Gosh, there he goes again.

1206
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:47,339
Do you think it's that
easy to become a reporter?

1207
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:49,402
Hey, knock it off.

1208
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:52,998
Do you think this job
is some kind of joke?

1209
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:55,512
Hey, enough already!

1210
00:50:57,967 --> 00:50:59,008
Suyeon...

1211
00:50:59,117 --> 00:51:00,516
...did you just slap me?

1212
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:01,856
With that grilled fish?

1213
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:02,842
Yes,

1214
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:04,102
I did.

1215
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:06,961
You were getting on my nerves.
What are you going to do?

1216
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,028
Han Suyeon!

1217
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,747
What are you doing?

1218
00:51:10,105 --> 00:51:12,517
This jerk was asking for it.

1219
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:14,891
Shut your mouth, you jerk.

1220
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,429
I hate you!

1221
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:21,209
I can't let her get away with this one.

1222
00:51:21,335 --> 00:51:23,243
I'll fire her.

1223
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:24,399
Producer.

1224
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:26,977
Have another glass with me.

1225
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,231
Yuri,

1226
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,341
where are you going?

1227
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:36,921
I'm going to look for a job.

1228
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:39,974
A job? What about Yuri's Kitchen 31?

1229
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,402
I still have to make a living.

1230
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:44,921
I can't live off you guys forever.

1231
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,977
Are you going back to the hotel
you used to work at?

1232
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:50,307
No. I don't think they'll
accept me back anyway.

1233
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:54,170
I'm thinking of asking
my ex-colleagues first.

1234
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:56,685
I'll see you guys later.

1235
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:58,471
See you.

1236
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,507
See you.

1237
00:52:06,669 --> 00:52:07,588
Hello, Coach.

1238
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:09,001
What?

1239
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,710
Okay. I understand.

1240
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:14,650
Thank you.

1241
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:15,732
Bye.

1242
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:19,408
Why did the coach call you?

1243
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:21,169
He wants you back on the team?

1244
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,549
No.

1245
00:52:24,071 --> 00:52:25,396
It's something else.

1246
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,783
I'm sorry.

1247
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:29,682
I'd love to hire you,

1248
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,689
but there's no vacancy
in the kitchen right now.

1249
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:34,861
I understand.

1250
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:39,352
Can you at least give me
Youngjin's phone number?

1251
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:41,547
You want to ask Youngjin too?

1252
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:44,649
Yuri, there's no point in asking others.

1253
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:45,600
What?

1254
00:52:45,956 --> 00:52:48,684
What do you mean by that?

1255
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,965
Gosh, my head.

1256
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:03,260
Wooshik.

1257
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,313
What happened to the producer?

1258
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:11,981
Don't worry.
I made him completely pass out.

1259
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,810
Gosh, why is it so noisy?

1260
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,638
Oh, Suyeon.

1261
00:53:19,356 --> 00:53:20,966
Who is this guy, by the way?

1262
00:53:21,055 --> 00:53:21,904
What?

1263
00:53:22,516 --> 00:53:24,282
He's my friend.

1264
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:27,176
You've been drinking together all night.
You don't remember?

1265
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:29,925
I don't remember a thing.

1266
00:53:30,014 --> 00:53:32,758
See? I told you he doesn't
remember anything.

1267
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:36,731
I should really quit drinking.

1268
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,895
Gosh, why are my lips burning?

1269
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:44,806
What happened to my face?

1270
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:46,090
What are these bruises?

1271
00:53:46,179 --> 00:53:47,332
What happened?

1272
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,688
What's the big deal if you
got a "kisu" on your lips?

1273
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:51,984
Stop fussing.

1274
00:53:53,032 --> 00:53:55,182
Did you just say "kisu"?

1275
00:53:55,596 --> 00:53:57,162
It's Japanese.

1276
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:58,096
Oh, you're right.

1277
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,400
I'm sorry.

1278
00:53:59,846 --> 00:54:00,899
It was a mistake.

1279
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,595
How could you make such a mistake?

1280
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:05,629
I didn't know you were
such a careless person.

1281
00:54:05,749 --> 00:54:08,002
Gosh, he's getting out of line.

1282
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,843
What did you learn in the Korean classes?

1283
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:12,274
You better stop now.

1284
00:54:12,363 --> 00:54:16,699
Young people these days say things
without thinking. It's a problem.

1285
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:21,444
Knock it off, you jerk!

1286
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,602
-Did you just hit me?
-I did. What are you going to do?

1287
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:29,047
With that pumpkin-flavored sour belt
that you've been sucking on?

1288
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:30,236
You know what?

1289
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,724
You say such obnoxious things.

1290
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,684
You look down on people with your words.

1291
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,386
That's why Suyeon hit you
with that chicken foot.

1292
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:40,562
What did you just say?

1293
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,160
Suyeon hit me?

1294
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:43,477
With a chicken foot?

1295
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:47,012
Cha Wooshik, are you crazy?

1296
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:49,104
Oh, right. It's supposed to be a secret.

1297
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:52,439
Still, I won't tell him you hit
him with a grilled fish too.

1298
00:54:53,601 --> 00:54:55,286
You hit me with a grilled fish too?

1299
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,365
Yuri, what are you doing here?

1300
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:13,172
Why are you drinking alone?

1301
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:15,053
Kibong.

1302
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:24,233
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

1303
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,348
How much did you drink?

1304
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,358
Did you land any job?

1305
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:33,150
No, I couldn't get any.

1306
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:38,243
The hotel chef I used to work for...

1307
00:55:38,604 --> 00:55:41,558
...banned everyone from hiring me.

1308
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:44,016
The truth is,

1309
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:48,641
I threw spaghetti
at his face before I left.

1310
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:50,646
Why?

1311
00:55:55,456 --> 00:55:58,228
I worked for him for 10 years.

1312
00:55:59,698 --> 00:56:01,346
But he gave the sous-chef position...

1313
00:56:01,813 --> 00:56:04,303
...to someone who had worked
there less than five years.

1314
00:56:06,223 --> 00:56:07,861
I've never studied abroad,

1315
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:10,173
and I don't have an impressive background.

1316
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,607
He said it'd be embarrassing
if I got the position.

1317
00:56:13,726 --> 00:56:16,631
That's why I threw the spaghetti...

1318
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:22,261
Yuri...

1319
00:56:22,404 --> 00:56:23,452
...are you okay?

1320
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,369
I'm fine.

1321
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:31,053
If my ex-colleagues can't hire me,

1322
00:56:33,168 --> 00:56:35,135
I'll just find any kind of part-time job.

1323
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:36,685
What about your dream?

1324
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:39,260
It's you lifetime dream
to open your own restaurant.

1325
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:46,424
How many people in the world...

1326
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,738
...actually realize their dreams?

1327
00:56:50,313 --> 00:56:52,045
I'm just going to give up.

1328
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:54,820
Are you sure you're okay with that?

1329
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:58,600
Of course. I'm fine.

1330
00:56:59,724 --> 00:57:02,767
I'm really fine, so don't worry about me.

1331
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:13,431
Yuri...

1332
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:14,730
...look at me.

1333
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,388
Why?

1334
00:57:20,943 --> 00:57:22,404
Hey.

1335
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,736
What did you do?

1336
00:57:24,825 --> 00:57:26,736
You told this to me once.

1337
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:28,559
"Just cry if you fell like crying"

1338
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:32,504
So don't hold it back. Cry if you want to.

1339
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:38,117
Kibong.

1340
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:40,336
What should I do now?

1341
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:47,180
I really wanted to make it work this time.

1342
00:57:51,094 --> 00:57:52,524
But now...

1343
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:56,426
I feel...

1344
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,688
I feel completely hopeless.

1345
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,772
What should I do now?

1346
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:21,539
What should I do?

1347
00:58:36,505 --> 00:58:38,054
Hey, Cha Wooshik.

1348
00:58:38,475 --> 00:58:40,713
Get a hold of yourself!

1349
00:58:42,844 --> 00:58:43,861
You're so heavy.

1350
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:53,022
Where is this? Am I home?

1351
00:58:54,324 --> 00:58:55,478
Suyeon.

1352
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:57,537
How did we get here?

1353
00:58:57,626 --> 00:58:59,986
I brought you here. Me.

1354
00:59:00,128 --> 00:59:03,393
Seriously, you're heavy as hell.

1355
00:59:03,613 --> 00:59:04,897
Really?

1356
00:59:05,939 --> 00:59:07,507
What happened to the producer?

1357
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:08,826
Don't you remember?

1358
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,007
You told him I slapped him
with chicken feet and he went crazy.

1359
00:59:13,096 --> 00:59:14,027
Really?

1360
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:16,471
Don't worry.

1361
00:59:16,775 --> 00:59:18,917
I took care of everything.

1362
00:59:19,132 --> 00:59:21,253
Mister, get up. Get up!

1363
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:23,157
What? What do you want?

1364
00:59:23,246 --> 00:59:25,233
It's time for us to close,
so please leave.

1365
00:59:25,322 --> 00:59:26,423
Where am I?

1366
00:59:27,485 --> 00:59:28,562
Why am I here?

1367
00:59:29,576 --> 00:59:33,044
No matter how hard he tries,
he won't remember.

1368
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:36,295
Do you know how hard
I tried to make him drink?

1369
00:59:37,088 --> 00:59:39,583
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

1370
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:42,116
It's okay.

1371
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:45,354
I know you did it to help me.

1372
00:59:46,952 --> 00:59:48,665
Thanks for helping me.

1373
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:51,243
You don't have to thank me.

1374
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:53,085
It's just...

1375
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,880
I always feel thankful to you.

1376
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,124
You let me live here...

1377
01:00:00,622 --> 01:00:04,406
...and you always came to see me
whenever I was in trouble.

1378
01:00:04,508 --> 01:00:06,076
Don't mention it.

1379
01:00:06,993 --> 01:00:09,951
I just did all that because I liked it.

1380
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,314
You liked it?

1381
01:00:13,494 --> 01:00:14,586
It's just...

1382
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:18,290
When you smile, I feel happy too...

1383
01:00:18,394 --> 01:00:21,196
...and when it's hard for you
it's hard for you me too.

1384
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:23,857
When you're sad, I feel sad too.

1385
01:00:25,545 --> 01:00:27,025
When you're not near me,

1386
01:00:27,677 --> 01:00:31,409
I feel concerned and
you're always on my mind.

1387
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:34,571
Do you like me, by any chance?

1388
01:00:41,736 --> 01:00:43,368
What's wrong with you?

1389
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:46,435
I was just kidding.

1390
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:49,183
I'm not kidding.

1391
01:00:53,346 --> 01:00:54,495
Suyeon.

1392
01:00:56,535 --> 01:00:58,978
I have something to tell you.

1393
01:01:02,137 --> 01:01:04,418
"Waikiki Guest House"

1394
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:06,166
That's so loud.

1395
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,970
Who is it so early in the morning?

1396
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:19,191
Hello?

1397
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:20,871
Kibong. What?

1398
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,972
Yuri, come outside for a second.

1399
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:23,820
Hurry.

1400
01:01:25,574 --> 01:01:27,316
What is this about?

1401
01:01:28,804 --> 01:01:30,437
I'm super sleepy.

1402
01:01:30,526 --> 01:01:32,459
What does he want to see me for?

1403
01:01:36,283 --> 01:01:37,389
I feel dizzy.

1404
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:40,133
Yuri.

1405
01:01:42,622 --> 01:01:44,873
Why are you calling me out
so early in the morning?

1406
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:46,403
Come down. Hurry.

1407
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:48,581
Gosh, this is so annoying.

1408
01:01:56,565 --> 01:01:57,665
What is that?

1409
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,030
"Yuri's Kitchen 31"

1410
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,299
Ta-da!

1411
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,635
"Yuri's Kitchen 31"

1412
01:02:14,454 --> 01:02:15,595
Kibong.

1413
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,722
I promised you I'd open
a restaurant for you.

1414
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:22,049
But I can't afford to open
a real restaurant now.

1415
01:02:22,324 --> 01:02:23,908
I only had enough for a food truck.

1416
01:02:24,297 --> 01:02:25,947
It's also a used truck.

1417
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:28,968
Where did you get the money?

1418
01:02:31,052 --> 01:02:32,991
Actually, I received
my last salary yesterday.

1419
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,382
It's the last money I made
as a baseball player.

1420
01:02:36,275 --> 01:02:38,161
I wondered what I should
do with that money...

1421
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:40,565
...and decided to invest in you.

1422
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:44,434
So you should work hard
to make money and pay me back.

1423
01:02:46,755 --> 01:02:48,254
Kibong.

1424
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:53,857
Yuri, are you crying?

1425
01:02:53,994 --> 01:02:55,250
Thank you.

1426
01:02:56,203 --> 01:02:58,401
Thank you so much, Kibong.

1427
01:03:00,812 --> 01:03:01,965
Don't mention it.

1428
01:03:02,054 --> 01:03:04,039
I was just keeping my promise.

1429
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:06,249
"A man's word is worth his weight
in installments." Don't you know?

1430
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:07,658
Of course I do.

1431
01:03:08,147 --> 01:03:11,806
"A man's word is worth his weight
in installments."

1432
01:03:17,032 --> 01:03:19,252
Don't cry. Stop crying now.

1433
01:03:23,487 --> 01:03:24,365
Wooshik.

1434
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:26,086
Get up, dude.

1435
01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:28,090
Get up.

1436
01:03:29,564 --> 01:03:30,505
Hey!

1437
01:03:30,594 --> 01:03:32,136
You scared me. Who are you?

1438
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,478
Jungi.

1439
01:03:36,225 --> 01:03:38,297
How much did you drink last night?

1440
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:40,757
What? I don't know, something came up.

1441
01:03:41,457 --> 01:03:42,957
My headache is killing me.

1442
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,541
But...

1443
01:03:46,074 --> 01:03:48,040
I think something happened last night.

1444
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:50,533
Wait.

1445
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:52,778
Suyeon.

1446
01:03:53,031 --> 01:03:55,384
I have something to tell you.

1447
01:03:57,764 --> 01:03:58,714
What is it?

1448
01:03:58,994 --> 01:04:00,186
To tell you the truth,

1449
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,676
I like you.

1450
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,572
I like you very much.

1451
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:11,115
From the first moment I saw you,

1452
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,587
I've never forgotten you
for a single moment.

1453
01:04:20,387 --> 01:04:21,681
I really mean it.

1454
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:29,429
Why?

1455
01:04:29,518 --> 01:04:30,906
Did you do something crazy last night?

1456
01:04:30,994 --> 01:04:32,304
Well, the thing is...

1457
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:34,323
I got drunk and confessed to Suyeon...

1458
01:04:35,441 --> 01:04:36,555
...that I like her.

1459
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:38,309
You confessed?

1460
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:41,392
So, how did it go? What did Suyeon say?

1461
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:43,571
I don't know. I don't remember after that.

1462
01:04:44,075 --> 01:04:46,186
Jungi, what should I do?

1463
01:04:46,275 --> 01:04:47,835
You're such an idiot.

1464
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,458
"Welcome to Waikiki 2"

1465
01:05:18,127 --> 01:05:19,262
How long will you keep this up?

1466
01:05:19,351 --> 01:05:20,690
Aren't you going to ask her out?

1467
01:05:20,779 --> 01:05:22,130
He's a producer who joined recently.

1468
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:23,925
He was shooting a show
at a shooting range...

1469
01:05:24,014 --> 01:05:25,048
...and hurt his ear.

1470
01:05:25,137 --> 01:05:27,233
Suyeon, I have something to say to you.

1471
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:28,726
I can't hear. I don't hear a thing.

1472
01:05:28,815 --> 01:05:29,909
I'll work really hard...

1473
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:31,966
...and pay Kibong back for his kindness.

1474
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,096
Why do you look so down?

1475
01:05:33,184 --> 01:05:35,696
My boss said he'd fire me
if I don't sell a car within this week.

1476
01:05:35,784 --> 01:05:36,976
-I haven't sold one yet.
-Rebecca.

1477
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:38,366
How about changing cars?

1478
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:39,552
Please save Rebecca.

1479
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:41,707
What did you do until your
car reached this state?

1480
01:05:41,795 --> 01:05:43,871
Rebecca! Rebecca!
