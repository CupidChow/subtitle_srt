1
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:13,124
-So glad, it passed right?
-Yes, I'm so glad.

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,934
-Let's go have some chicken and beer.
-Yes. I would love that!

3
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:21,154
Suyeon.

4
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,562
Hey, Wooshik.

5
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:23,561
You are here early today.

6
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:25,671
Yes, I no longer need
to go five o'clock live.

7
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:28,758
-What are you looking at?
-Well...

8
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:30,959
Because I envy them.

9
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:32,855
Envy of what?

10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,666
Those women,

11
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:39,053
they seem like my age. And they
already got a job and do what they like.

12
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,743
They are stepping forward.

13
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:47,249
I don't know how long do I need
to live by working as a part time.

14
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:52,653
It's not like I have something
I want to do nor am good at.

15
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,765
So I'm just feeling little stuffy.

16
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:57,463
I see.

17
00:00:58,757 --> 00:00:59,557
Right.

18
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,162
Didn't you say,
you want to be a news anchor?

19
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,458
I do, but...

20
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:06,857
...being an anchor is not an easy job.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,364
How am I going to become now?

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,962
Why? They have an academy for anchor.

23
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,065
You can enroll and prepare.

24
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,366
And how am I going to pay for it?

25
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:16,991
It's fine.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,793
I will head inside first.

27
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:32,997
Three million won per three months?

28
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:35,308
Why is it so expensive?

29
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:38,498
Kibong, where are you going?

30
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,410
Of course, I'm going for the training...

31
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,338
Right... I got kicked out.

32
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:51,616
It became my habit.

33
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,599
I should get more sleep.

34
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,607
Gosh, seriously...

35
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:03,201
How am I going to get the money?

36
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,678
I should think after getting some sleep.

37
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,579
Why did you do it to me?

38
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:39,081
Tell me.

39
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,289
Why did you do it?

40
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,191
You humiliate me.

41
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,793
Don't joke with me.

42
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,690
Tell me the real reason.

43
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,285
Tell me.

44
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:53,595
What did you do it to me?

45
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,794
Tell me.

46
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,682
Say something!

47
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,808
Wow! Byunghun's acting
is really amazing, right?

48
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,602
How can you watch a movie at this moment?

49
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,808
Aren't you worried that
Kibong has been kicked out?

50
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:09,605
He was crying his eyes out in the
corner of the room few days ago.

51
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:10,482
Really?

52
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,880
I'm worried.
He hasn't been eating these days.

53
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,259
Well, I have no choice.

54
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:18,156
I should step out.

55
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,665
Guys, I will make sure Kibong
to gain his strength back.

56
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,475
-Just trust me.
-Trust what?

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,479
You always cause trouble,
whenever you say that!

58
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:29,876
-Just don't do anything, please!
-I'm telling you,

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,829
I have my own way. Just trust me!

60
00:03:34,537 --> 00:03:35,329
Wait for me.

61
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:37,537
What kind of trouble are
you going to make this time?

62
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,028
Tell me.

63
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:43,440
Yes.

64
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,040
What happened to the event that I asked?

65
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:47,245
Today?

66
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,841
One million won?

67
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,666
Okay, got it. I will be there.

68
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,673
Okay, thanks!

69
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,053
What do you mean event?

70
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,358
-You said, you would never do event.
-I have my reason.

71
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:02,048
-See you!
-Tell me.

72
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,754
Tell me where are you going.

73
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,353
What kind of event are we having in here?

74
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,558
-Is it an opening ceremony?
-No.

75
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,351
-It's my boss's wife's birthday.
-Pardon?

76
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:17,944
You guys are having her
birthday party in the pub?

77
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,944
Wow.

78
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,039
I guess you guys are very open minded.

79
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,243
Let's hurry.

80
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:27,449
I told you,

81
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,965
you shouldn't have done it.

82
00:04:31,876 --> 00:04:33,068
Don't be scared.

83
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,891
We just had a small problem.

84
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:36,572
-Let's go.
-Yes.

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,452
Sir, the singer has arrived!

86
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:00,230
Hello, you are here.

87
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,533
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yongpal.

88
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:06,723
Hello.

89
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:08,535
Wait,

90
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:09,635
Kim Yongpal?

91
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,598
I've heard it before.

92
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,003
Where did I hear it before?

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,800
Don't tell me...

94
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:16,594
Kim Yongpal of Yongpal gang?

95
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,267
You have watched the news, have you?

96
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:24,759
Don't trust it.

97
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,092
I'm just...

98
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:28,947
...a hard working business man.

99
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:30,247
Yes, boss.

100
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,239
I mean, sir.

101
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,973
Today is my wife's birthday,
whom I love more than myself.

102
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,868
Please sing well for us,

103
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,360
and make her happy.
My wife likes music very much.

104
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,836
Yes, yes. Don't worry.

105
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,222
Madam has arrived.

106
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,405
Really?

107
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,103
Honey!

108
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:56,959
You are here.

109
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:01,650
-Ta-da!
-Welcome, madam!

110
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:07,778
Oh, my. Are you all here for my birthday?
How sweet.

111
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,097
Have you cut your hair, Dongsu?

112
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,703
-It's so cute!
-Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:19,668
Shave his head.

114
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:22,071
Sorry... I'm sorry, sir!

115
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,884
I just cut it because it was too long.
I didn't know it will turn out this cute!

116
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,773
I will cut it again, sir!

117
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:31,312
Please save me. I'm so sorry, sir!

118
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,923
What is wrong with you again?

119
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,026
-I just said it was nice.
-Just?

120
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:39,426
The way he looked at you
was wicked since before.

121
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,013
Now,

122
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,726
don't mind him and let's party.

123
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:48,362
Gee, you are driving me crazy.

124
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,374
Right.

125
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,760
He is...

126
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:56,344
...a singer to sing for you.

127
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:57,638
-Say hello.
-Really?

128
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:59,932
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

129
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,427
Are you...

130
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,024
...Shiva Wooshik?

131
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,232
You are Shiva Wooshik of Taj Mahal, right?

132
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,524
What? Yes, yes.

133
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:12,621
-How do you know me?
-Oh my god, it's me!

134
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,627
I'm president of Taj Mahal, Kang Miyoung!

135
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:17,127
Nickname is Shiva lover!
Shiva Wooshik lover!

136
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:19,412
-Don't you remember me?
-Wait, Shiva lover...

137
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,380
Miyoung?

138
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:25,268
Yes, that's right! How long has it been?

139
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,701
Oh my god, yes! How long has it...

140
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,692
It's been a long time, madam!

141
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,985
Gee, don't call me that.
Anyway, it's so good to see you!

142
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,793
I can't believe it's real!

143
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:49,314
Hey, Kibong.

144
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,215
How long are you going to be like this?

145
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,921
You need to eat something! You are
really going to die due to starvation.

146
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,714
It' doesn't matter.

147
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:57,804
I can't even play baseball no more.

148
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,915
-I'd rather die.
-What?

149
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:02,906
Are you saying it for real, you jerk?

150
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:06,583
All I have been doing was playing
baseball, since I was young.

151
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,902
Baseball is all I have.

152
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,600
But I can no longer play it.

153
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,179
I can't play forever.

154
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,670
Do you even understand how I feel?

155
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:18,290
-Still... Kibong.
-Never mind.

156
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,773
Stop bothering me and leave.

157
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,422
-I said, leave.
-Kibong, don't be like that.

158
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,112
I bought some dessert. Have some.

159
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:27,735
I bought it from hand-made chocolate shop.

160
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,824
If you eat this,

161
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,625
it will make your worries gone
because it's too delicious.

162
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:34,434
What?

163
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:39,597
Do you really think this
chocolate will make me feel better?

164
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:42,200
I can't even swallow single grain of rice.

165
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,993
-It feels like I'm chewing sand.
-Okay, I got it.

166
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,878
If you just have one,

167
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,982
I will bother you no more.

168
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:53,274
You promise?

169
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:55,475
You will leave, if I just eat one.

170
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:00,765
Unbelievable. What do you think of me?

171
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:04,869
This is good.

172
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:06,748
It's so good!

173
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,353
How can it be this good?

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,653
I don't know if chocolate is
melting or my tongue is melting.

175
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,801
This is incredible. Truly amazing.

176
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:18,673
The taste is actually
melting all my worries away.

177
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,621
How is it? Isn't it good?

178
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,835
-You actually feel better, right?
-What?

179
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:30,414
It's just so-so.

180
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,810
Really?

181
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,612
That's weird.

182
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:38,964
-Everyone felt better after this.
-Told you, it won't work.

183
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,059
How can he feel better with only this?

184
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,558
Do you really think he's
some simple-minded idiot?

185
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:46,755
Sorry.

186
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,959
Shall I leave it here,
so that you can have it?

187
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,668
Gosh, don't! He obviously
doesn't have a mood for this.

188
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,271
Let's just leave him rest. Let's go.

189
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,580
Go. Get some rest, Kibong.

190
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,770
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

191
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:08,877
Darn it.

192
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,052
-Wow!
-Wow!

193
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,957
-This chocolate is really good.
-You are right.

194
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
It really makes me feel good.

195
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:19,440
Right?

196
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:22,465
But it doesn't work for Kibong.

197
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,257
I wonder how sad he is.

198
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:28,566
-Hey, Kibong. Do you need something?
-No...

199
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:31,353
-I just want to drink water.
-Here it is. Drink and get some rest.

200
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:38,252
What?

201
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:39,516
They already ate it all?

202
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,811
Cheap jerks.

203
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,619
I want it.

204
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,009
I want it too.

205
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:47,017
I really want to eat.

206
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,608
It's bit embarrassing to ask for one now.

207
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:51,091
What should I do?

208
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,091
-What the!
-Oh, dear.

209
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:56,692
I made a mistake.

210
00:10:57,496 --> 00:11:00,153
It's okay. We can just wipe it.
Jungi, get some rag.

211
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,139
Sure.

212
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:03,929
Gee, it's all wet.

213
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,454
Wipe it with this first.

214
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,634
Kibong, we will take care of it.
Go and get some rest.

215
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,739
Where did he go?

216
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,447
That was good.

217
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,239
It was so natural.

218
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:28,299
Shall I try it now?

219
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:33,969
Gee, you startled me.

220
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,445
What are you doing in front of the door?
You scared me.

221
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:39,556
I was just...

222
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,056
Why didn't you knock?

223
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:44,158
Isn't it weird to knock
on the door for my room?

224
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:45,840
Gee...

225
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:52,600
Let's see. Where did I put it?

226
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:54,902
Where did it go?

227
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,966
-Hey, get a good rest.
-Sure.

228
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,068
Oh, geez. What is it?

229
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,560
Almost stepped on it.

230
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:04,975
What is it?

231
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:10,965
It's a chocolate. Why is it here?

232
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:13,569
Don't tell me,

233
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:16,674
-did you bring to eat it?
-Well...

234
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,577
No!

235
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:20,880
You are right.

236
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,888
-You said, you have no appetite.
-Of course.

237
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:26,662
-I will throw it. Give it to me.
-Will you?

238
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:31,248
Why do you want to throw it?
It will be a waste! I should eat it.

239
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,263
Gosh, it's so sweet.

240
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:42,592
Darn it.

241
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:52,499
You are still the same as before, Wooshik.

242
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,102
-You are still handsome.
-Gosh.

243
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,145
No, I'm not.

244
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,946
It was my dream to marry you.

245
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,826
What do you like about that jerk?

246
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,785
What do you like about that gentleman?

247
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:17,175
Of course, it's because of singing.
Wooshik is really good at it.

248
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,770
Singing, you say?

249
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:22,964
-I am good at singing too.
-Well,

250
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:28,142
you are good but you can't
beat Wooshik with it.

251
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,237
Is that so?

252
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:33,245
Shall we compete with our singing skill?

253
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:37,128
-Let's bet on our finger.
-Fi... Finger?

254
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,838
Don't be too scared.

255
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:41,741
-It was a joke.
-I see...

256
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,759
The winner gets to finger
flick on loser's forehead.

257
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:46,166
What do you say?

258
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:49,579
-I don't think that's a good idea...
-What are you doing? Get things ready.

259
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,563
-Yes, boss!
-Yes, boss!

260
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:54,915
I will...

261
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,717
...start first.

262
00:13:57,814 --> 00:14:00,518
-You know my wife's favorite song, right?
-Yes, sir.

263
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,010
"Fire by Blackpink"

264
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:39,295
Well, you need to practice more.

265
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:40,799
"Point 65"

266
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:45,204
What a shame.

267
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:47,299
You got 65 points.

268
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,798
Well now, it's Wooshik's turn!

269
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:58,951
I'm in trouble.

270
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:03,124
He is overly jealous.

271
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:06,815
My life will be in danger, if I win.

272
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:08,624
I need to lose no matter what.

273
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,373
What kind of song do I need to choose?

274
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,665
Yes, this is it.

275
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:16,959
"Hen pheasant hunt by Kim Serena"

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,396
Full score! Congratulations!

277
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,592
Chocolate box should be around here.

278
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,894
Gosh, I should have
checked the name of the store.

279
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,154
Stupid, stupid!

280
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,947
Oh god!

281
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,447
What are you doing over there?

282
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,121
Why are you looking into rubbish?

283
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,431
I need to look for something.

284
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,115
By the way,

285
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,819
where did you throw...

286
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,611
...the chocolate box you guys had?

287
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:42,531
Oh, that sweet stuff!

288
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,825
-Why are you looking for it?
-What?

289
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,852
I think it's a perfect
size for name cards.

290
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,752
Name cards.

291
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:54,458
-But you don't have any.
-I might in the future!

292
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:57,841
-You think I will live as jobless forever?
-I'm not saying that.

293
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:01,862
Hey, when you get a job,
I will buy you a name card wallet.

294
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:04,148
-Don't worry, you jerk.
-Hey!

295
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:05,864
What name card wallet?

296
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:08,944
It's all waste! Waste!

297
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,547
If we keep the box, we can save the trees,

298
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,615
reduce waste, solve global warming.
How wonderful is that?

299
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,116
So where is the box?

300
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:20,013
I put it outside for
garbage truck to pick up.

301
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,221
-Outside where?
-What do you mean?

302
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,824
They already picked up,
when I went outside.

303
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
What?

304
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:29,624
Why did you put it out so early?

305
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,454
-Do you even think?
-What?

306
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,953
How can you not think about Earth?
You jerk!

307
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:37,772
-You clean this up!
-Why should I... Hey!

308
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:41,530
Why is he scolding me over throwing a box?

309
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:49,373
Gosh, I'm going crazy!

310
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,579
Why did he throw it away?

311
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,262
I'm dying to have one.

312
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:58,205
How am I going to buy one when I
don't even know the name of the store?

313
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,213
Right.

314
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,221
Yuri bought that chocolate.

315
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,333
Yuri should know the name!

316
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,101
The caller is unavailable right now.

317
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:12,686
What? Why isn't she picking up?

318
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:14,781
Why isn't she picking up? Darn it!

319
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:21,523
He's really pissed off. I'm sure of it.

320
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,014
Should I just run away?

321
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,024
What about Suyeon's academy fee?

322
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,817
Gosh, this is insane!

323
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,942
Right, Wooshik.

324
00:18:29,046 --> 00:18:32,236
Do you remember when we
went to camp with members?

325
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:33,020
Yes?

326
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:37,070
Yes. I remember.

327
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:41,281
We did Pirate Roulette
with 40 club members.

328
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,433
And you never caught
once and won the game.

329
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,241
-Did I?
-Yes, you did!

330
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:54,610
You are so handsome but lucky as well!

331
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:58,515
Really? You are lucky, aren't you?

332
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:01,324
I, myself is pretty lucky too.

333
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:07,689
I have been...

334
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:10,284
...stabbed about 40 times.

335
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,601
And I'm still alive.

336
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,880
I... I see.

337
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,054
You are...

338
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:17,666
...incredible.

339
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,703
Why don't we compete on our luck?

340
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,808
This time,

341
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:29,100
-loser gets 10 flicks.
-10 flicks?

342
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,411
-I don't know. I don't really...
-What are you guys doing?

343
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:34,212
-Set it up right now.
-Yes, boss!

344
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,604
I must lose this time.

345
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:39,909
I must lose no matter what.

346
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,115
If I win again, today will be my last day.

347
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:44,313
Then,

348
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:46,021
who should be the first?

349
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,314
Roulette game!

350
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,817
It's a game of probability.

351
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,719
The person who starts
first is advantageous.

352
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,903
If then...

353
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,601
Why don't you start first, sir?

354
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,618
We need to follow the order of seniority.

355
00:19:57,602 --> 00:19:59,522
Sure.

356
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:04,146
I will start to stab.

357
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,535
Yes, that's right!

358
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:09,154
No one can lose in the beginning
unless he's an unlucky fool.

359
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,937
My life comes before money.

360
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,325
-I need to get out of here.
-Hey!

361
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,349
Singer boy.

362
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,969
Where are you going in a
hurry without saying a word?

363
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,366
Yes? Well, I just....

364
00:21:10,454 --> 00:21:12,960
I think I didn't turn off the gas range.

365
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:16,060
But you still need to end things with me.

366
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:17,361
What do you mean end?

367
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,151
-You seriously don't know?
-Please don't kill me.

368
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,349
Don't kill me.

369
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,056
Stop right there!

370
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,377
I need to give you the event cost!

371
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,464
I'm back.

372
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:34,361
Are they all sleeping?

373
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,008
Gee, I'm so tired.

374
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,023
I should get some sleep.

375
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,369
-Oh, gosh. You scared me!
-Yuri.

376
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,385
Where have you been?

377
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:53,070
I was doing my research of
market for Yuri's Kitchen.

378
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:54,278
What's wrong?

379
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:57,666
Why didn't you answer my call?

380
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,668
Do you know how many
times I have called you?

381
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,297
Sorry.

382
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,120
My battery was out.

383
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,017
Do you have something to say to me?

384
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:07,603
Well...

385
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,687
The chocolate you gave me,

386
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,902
-where did you buy it from?
-What?

387
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:15,093
-Why are you asking?
-I want to get some of the boxes.

388
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:17,877
-I don't have place to put my name cards.
-Name cards?

389
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:21,282
-You don't have name cards.
-I might have one in the future!

390
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:24,188
Why does everyone think I
will live as jobless forever?

391
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:28,911
-Am I that incompetent?
-No. It's not like that.

392
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,729
-When you get a job, I will buy you...
-I said, it's a waste! Waste!

393
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:35,131
It's a destruction of environment!

394
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:39,733
So what is the name of the store?
Tell me the name of the store right now!

395
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,424
Why are you getting angry at me?

396
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:44,968
Then,

397
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:46,588
can't you use other box?

398
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:47,985
I have a box around that size...

399
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:53,211
It's because I like the design
and the color of that box, okay?

400
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:57,902
Why do you talk so much?
Just tell me the name, name!

401
00:22:58,109 --> 00:22:59,314
Okay, okay.

402
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:00,712
Okay, I heard you.

403
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,290
I will message you the name
and address of that store.

404
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,034
Okay.

405
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:08,837
By the way, are they still opened?

406
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,138
I want to know their operation hour.

407
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:11,551
-Do you want to go now?
-Yes.

408
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,646
Of course they are closed.
It's already late.

409
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,640
You should have come home early!

410
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,628
Send the text right now. Gosh!

411
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:26,364
Why is he getting mad at a small thing?

412
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,674
What's wrong with you?

413
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:35,048
If someone looks for me, tell them
I'm gone. No, I've immigrated. Okay?

414
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,291
Gosh, you scared me.

415
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:52,875
Brother,

416
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:55,980
-why are you doing down there?
-Yuri,

417
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,299
can you pass me a milk?

418
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,213
By the way,
has anyone come and look for me?

419
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,403
No one.

420
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:04,004
What is wrong with you seriously?

421
00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:06,797
-Did something happen at the event?
-What?

422
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,498
No, it's nothing.

423
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,653
-Where is Suyeon?
-She has no appetite.

424
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:15,066
Suyeon looks down these days.

425
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:16,455
I wonder if she has worries.

426
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,307
Where did Kibong go
without having a breakfast?

427
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,698
Finally I can get to eat it. Finally!

428
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:32,179
Chocolate that is moisture on the outside
and full of sweetness in the inside.

429
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:34,782
This is the place!

430
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,167
What is this?

431
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:42,581
"Odiv Belgium Chocolate Store"

432
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,779
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

433
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,203
What are you lining up for?

434
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,878
I'm lining up to buy chocolates.

435
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:52,293
This is really famous for chocolates.
You can't buy,

436
00:24:52,388 --> 00:24:53,983
-if you don't line up.
-What?

437
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:55,069
Excuse me.

438
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,579
What do you mean I can't buy?

439
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:01,165
They only sell limited quantity. Once
it's all sold out, they close the store.

440
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,054
What?

441
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:05,059
What the heck...

442
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:06,949
That means I might not be able to buy.

443
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:10,895
Gosh, no. I need to.

444
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,697
I really want to eat it.

445
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,154
Darn it.

446
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:25,464
They won't take revenge on me
just because of finger flicks.

447
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:28,669
I'm anxious to go events now.

448
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,168
How am I going to save up
for Suyeon's academy fee?

449
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,962
I don't know this number.

450
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,650
He...

451
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:43,573
-Hello?
-Wooshik, it's me. Miyoung.

452
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,161
-Miyoung, I mean...

453
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:50,129
-...madam!
-Don't call me that!

454
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:53,535
-What is the matter?
-You left without taking the event cost.

455
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,329
So I have called you to take it.

456
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:57,432
-Right, event cost...
-So...

457
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,322
-...do you want to come to my house?
-Pardon? Your house?

458
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,029
Can't you just bank in to me?

459
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,728
I have your guitar in my house too.

460
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:06,615
Right, I left my guitar too.

461
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,899
-Then, can you just send by delivery...
-Is it because of my husband?

462
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:12,885
My husband left for his work
so just come and get it. Okay?

463
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:15,393
Wait, wait, madam.

464
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,082
Gosh.

465
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:18,884
I don't want to go.

466
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:20,899
I'm scared.

467
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:24,382
Come in, come in.

468
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:28,392
-Why are you wearing a mask?
-Pardon?

469
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,689
I'm having some flu.

470
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,188
Where is my guitar?

471
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,753
There it is.

472
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,142
-Well, then. Goodbye.
-Wait.

473
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:43,959
You should take the money.
Wait for awhile.

474
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:50,563
There you go.

475
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:52,465
-It's one million won, right?
-Yes.

476
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:53,656
Thank you.

477
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:55,664
-I should go now.
-What?

478
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,059
You are leaving already?

479
00:26:57,156 --> 00:27:00,386
-I have an urgent matter.
-What kind?

480
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:02,696
I need to get some money in a hurry.

481
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,895
-How much?
-Well...

482
00:27:05,212 --> 00:27:06,406
Around two million won...

483
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,294
-Do you want me to give you that money?
-What?

484
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:10,406
Why should you...

485
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,020
-It's not right.
-Then,

486
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:16,624
what about lending it to you?
You can pay me back when you can.

487
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,011
Still, it's bit...

488
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:19,319
Why...

489
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,312
-...are you helping me?
-What do you mean why?

490
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,312
Don't you know I was the
president of your fan club?

491
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:27,303
I should help my favorite singer
out, if he's in trouble.

492
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:28,906
Gee, I'm not a singer.

493
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,010
I'm just a low class entertainer,

494
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:33,605
-who performs at birthdays.
-What are you saying?

495
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:36,214
In my heart, you are always a star.

496
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:40,517
I will be your fan until I die and
will be your fan forever. So cheer up!

497
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:43,111
-Thank you.
-You don't need to.

498
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:45,309
Where are my senses?

499
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,902
I will bring something to drink.

500
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:53,517
My fan until the day she dies.

501
00:27:54,414 --> 00:27:55,928
Just hearing that makes me happy.

502
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,325
Yes, Cha Wooshik.

503
00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:00,920
Let's cheer up for my fans.

504
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,801
Wooshik, I brought sikhye...

505
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:10,904
Oh, my...

506
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,784
What have I done?

507
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:22,385
Okay, I'm almost there. I can eat it
soon, if I wait few more minutes.

508
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,695
It will be so delicious.

509
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:29,651
Sorry to inform you that all chocolates
that we prepared have been sold out.

510
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:32,229
We will end our business today.

511
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:39,707
"As all ingredients are out,
we will end our business today."

512
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:49,414
"Close"

513
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:08,536
It's sticky, isn't it? It's my husband's.
Get changed and come out.

514
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:09,815
Okay.

515
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,194
Gee, look at myself.

516
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,591
I should get changed
fast, and get out of here.

517
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:23,677
Honey.

518
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:25,878
When did you come?

519
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:27,696
Just now. By the way,

520
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:29,775
-why are you so surprised?
-What?

521
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:34,479
No way. What do you mean surprised?

522
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,272
I thought you were
going to archery center.

523
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,249
How come you are here early?

524
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:41,456
Because of my migraine,

525
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:43,266
I couldn't get it right.

526
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,844
I shouldn't have let him leave like that.

527
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:52,007
I bet you are tired.
Why don't you get some rest?

528
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,609
Wait, hold on.

529
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:56,206
I should clean my bow at least.

530
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:07,487
Madam, I don't think the
clothes fit me...

531
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:11,192
Sir!

532
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:13,684
What are you doing here?
Those are my clothes.

533
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:15,977
Wait,

534
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:17,675
did you take a shower?

535
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:19,467
No, it's not like that...

536
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,459
I got sikhye all over me... Yes, yes...

537
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,958
-Yes, it's the truth.
-Shut up!

538
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,932
Are you expecting me to believe that?

539
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,321
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Yes, misunderstanding.

540
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,915
Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?

541
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,825
You both caught in action!

542
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,916
I can't just let it slide this time.

543
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:40,645
You come here.

544
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:42,326
-Come here.
-It's a misunderstanding.

545
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,231
Okay!

546
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:47,326
I will tell the truth. Actually,

547
00:30:48,855 --> 00:30:51,140
that man just came to our house.

548
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:53,444
What?

549
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:55,853
What?

550
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:59,342
Why are you saying that?

551
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:03,153
I'm right. I told you no
but you came to my house.

552
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:05,652
You asked for one cup of sikhye,

553
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:09,588
-and start to pour it on yourself!
-What?

554
00:31:10,288 --> 00:31:10,988
No...

555
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,888
It's not like that.

556
00:31:13,994 --> 00:31:15,994
You... You...

557
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:36,876
I bought it! I finally bought it!
Wait, wait.

558
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:40,009
I can't let guys see me, eating at home.

559
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:42,328
I got no choice.
I should finish it first and go home.

560
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:57,783
Mister!

561
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:00,204
-Could you please throw the ball to us?
-Sure.

562
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,786
"Hansung elementary"

563
00:32:16,652 --> 00:32:17,849
Thank you.

564
00:32:40,449 --> 00:32:41,849
Kibong's incredible pitch.

565
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:44,449
Thunderbolt Fire!

566
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:47,338
It's a strikeout!

567
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:49,753
Player Kook Kibong, no hit and no run,

568
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:52,540
he has won world series championship!

569
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,912
What are you doing, Kibong?

570
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:07,904
What?

571
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,595
I was wondering, where you have
gone since early this morning.

572
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,507
I see you have gone to
get the chocolate box.

573
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:14,505
Hey,

574
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,394
what's wrong?

575
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,895
They remind me of the old days.

576
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:24,322
I always played like them,
when I was their age.

577
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,339
I didn't even imagine,
I would be like this.

578
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,132
Yuri.

579
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:32,917
What should I do?

580
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,214
How should I live?

581
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:40,483
I hope someone can teach me.

582
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:48,779
Kibong,

583
00:33:49,471 --> 00:33:52,374
I saw this in some movie.

584
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:53,779
Life is...

585
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,895
...same as this chocolate box.

586
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:02,161
This box contains sweet chocolates,

587
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:04,670
but it also contains bitter ones too.

588
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,758
So the baseball was...

589
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,392
...a bitter chocolate for your life.

590
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,296
It's too bitter to swallow.

591
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,900
That kind of chocolate.

592
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:20,733
But there' still...

593
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:23,233
...a lot of other chocolates in your box.

594
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:26,828
"Chocolate"

595
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:29,246
Your career for baseball might be over,

596
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:30,976
but your life...

597
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:33,192
...hasn't been over.

598
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:34,484
Don't you think so?

599
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:38,992
Perhaps, if you choose other chocolate,

600
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:40,793
there might be another way.

601
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:43,174
But what if other
chocolates are bitter too?

602
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,372
Even so,

603
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,467
you have no choice.

604
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:49,959
Then,

605
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,444
you just have to pick
up another chocolate.

606
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,848
-But what if it's bitter as well?
-Seriously.

607
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:56,938
Never mind.

608
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,936
I was giving you a serious advice.

609
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,827
I'm just joking.

610
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,542
So I still have...

611
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,038
...other chocolates to try, right?

612
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,883
-Hey, can I have one too?
-No!

613
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,198
I went through hoops to get this.

614
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,776
I will eat it all by myself!

615
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:25,156
Gosh, you are so cheap.

616
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:27,248
Wait a minute.

617
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:30,617
You said it wasn't good.
I guess it was, right?

618
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:32,609
It was good, right?

619
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,720
Gee, I guess I'm right.

620
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:35,815
Hey,

621
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:37,906
give me one. You cheap jerk.

622
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,508
No way. I'm going to eat it all by myself.

623
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:41,405
Hey!

624
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:43,810
-I told you about the store.
-No.

625
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,520
Come and get it, if you can.

626
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,122
You think I can't?

627
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:49,830
How can you? You can never...

628
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:09,516
Oh my, Wooshik.

629
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:13,421
-What are you doing here?
-Why did you do that to me?

630
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,252
Tell me. Why did you do that to me?

631
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,245
You have given me a humiliation.

632
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,157
What kind of crappy excuse is that?

633
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:23,037
No, not that kind of reason.

634
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,942
Tell me the real reason.

635
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:27,336
I have thought about it a lot.

636
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,629
And I still don't know.

637
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,732
Were you trying to kill me?

638
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:34,132
Were you really trying to kill me?

639
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,934
You said,
you will be my side until you die!

640
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:40,539
Tell me.

641
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,739
Say something!

642
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:45,640
Then what should I do?

643
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:49,548
I could have gotten a
divorce, if I haven't done it!

644
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,346
Is that why you framed me?

645
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,938
Are you here to argue about that?

646
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:56,437
-You petty minded jerk!
-What? Petty?

647
00:36:56,836 --> 00:36:59,041
-You old lady...
-Old lady?

648
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,026
I won't let it slide
if you keep on doing it.

649
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:03,231
What are you going to do then?

650
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:05,421
Why are you whistling for?

651
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,246
Hey, you!

652
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,943
-Darn it. You traitor!
-Hey!

653
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:20,140
Next news, one of the biggest gang,
Yongpal gang has been arrested by police.

654
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:25,261
Leader of Yongpal gang, Kim and hundreds
of other gang members are arrested for...

655
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:29,055
...mob violence and robbery.

656
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:32,020
Gosh, that jerk is finally arrested.

657
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:33,313
You are right.

658
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:36,502
Wooshik, I know you've been through
a lot for running away from them.

659
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,710
I was so scared and stressed out, Jungi.

660
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,815
I know. I know how you feel.

661
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:43,824
Let's watch something else.

662
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,133
-Next news...
-Hello.

663
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,101
I just saw a familiar face.

664
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,198
And tear invoking sad stories.

665
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,293
Who is that?

666
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,718
We visit fascinating places.
The popular segment on "6PM My Hometown",

667
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:04,517
"Oh, my. How can this happen?" time!

668
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:08,828
Shall we say it again?
"Let's go!" One more time, "Let's go!"

669
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:12,011
-That's you, right?
-What are you talking about? That's not!

670
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:13,962
-Switch it to something else!
-Wait, wait!

671
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,153
-Wait, stay still!
-Hey!

672
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:20,161
-Stay still!
-Help! Let me go!

673
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:21,847
No!

674
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,045
I'm reporter version of
Yoo Jaesuk, Lee Jungi.

675
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:31,506
Yes, I'm here to meet a dog which pees
standing up at Jungeup, Jeonlabuk-do.

676
00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:34,507
Gildong! There you are!

677
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:38,416
-Let's go, Gildong!
-Gildong!

678
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,321
Its name is Gildong!

679
00:38:43,116 --> 00:38:44,402
It's his lucky dog!

680
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:46,315
-Gil...
-Don't.

681
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,015
-Gildong.
-Stop laughing!

682
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,023
Especially you, stop laughing!
You jerk!

683
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,944
-You were about to die a minute ago!
-Sorry, sorry.

684
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:57,119
What is that?
When did you become a reporter?

685
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,937
What should I do?

686
00:38:59,024 --> 00:39:01,130
I'm about to be seized
lawfully due to my card debts.

687
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,932
Still, what's up with that outfit?

688
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:05,622
-It's all concept, okay? You jerk!
-Hey.

689
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:08,130
That show is hosted by Cho Sangwoo, right?

690
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:11,034
-How do you know?
-I'm a big fan of anchor Cho Sangwoo.

691
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:12,336
Can you...

692
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,336
-...get me his autograph?
-Autograph?

693
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:17,328
-Okay, why not.
-Yes!

694
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:20,179
How is your reporting work, Jungi?
Is it fun?

695
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,178
It's actually quite fun.

696
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:25,479
You can get to meet fun people,
and eat delicious foods.

697
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,361
I see.

698
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,266
That sounds fun.

699
00:39:37,603 --> 00:39:39,912
-Do I look like a mantis?
-Totally.

700
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:44,705
What's up with you? Came all the way
here and now helping me with my make up.

701
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:45,497
What?

702
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:46,894
Well... No reason.

703
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:49,895
When will anchor Cho Sangwoo come?

704
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:51,036
Sangwoo?

705
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,337
Of course he has his private room
with professional make up teams...

706
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:57,829
Hold on.

707
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:01,024
-Are you here to see Sangwoo?
-No, I'm not.

708
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,635
-I'm obviously right.
-No!

709
00:40:03,723 --> 00:40:06,213
I was wondering what was up with you.

710
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:09,650
-Jungi!
-Sangwoo, you are here.

711
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:11,053
Have some donuts.

712
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,053
-I got it from my fan.
-Thank you, sir.

713
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:19,865
Sangwoo, this is my friend.

714
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,968
And she's a big fan of yours.

715
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:24,746
-I see.
-Come on, say hello.

716
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:28,237
Hello, I'm Kim Jeongeun.

717
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:29,943
Hello, nice to meet you.

718
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:32,449
-I will see you around.
-Yes.

719
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:33,733
Take it easy.

720
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:35,949
-I will see you in a bit.
-Sure.

721
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:37,836
I was so nervous.

722
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,835
-My heart was about to come out!
-Gee.

723
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:42,645
Do you like him that much?

724
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:46,451
-Why don't you ask him out?
-No way, how could I...

725
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,450
Why can't you?

726
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:50,251
Do you want me to help?

727
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:51,441
You?

728
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,069
Who am I?

729
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:55,253
I'm the master of dating, Lee Jungi.

730
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:59,936
I can get you both married to each other.

731
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,745
-Really?
-Of course!

732
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:02,847
Exchange of that,

733
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,637
you need to help me with my makeup.
What do you say?

734
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:06,637
Deal?

735
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:08,446
Deal.

736
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,237
I think this is enough for
business plan for Yuri's Kitchen.

737
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:22,033
Start up fund is most important.
Where can I get it from?

738
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:25,956
-It's giving me a headache.
-I'm back.

739
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,465
Where did you go, Kibong?

740
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:29,858
I just...

741
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:31,148
...went out for a jog,

742
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,180
since I've been feeling heavy
from lying down all day long.

743
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:36,957
What happened? You didn't even
eat well and were feeling down.

744
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:39,906
You told me, there will be
other chocolates left for me.

745
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:41,311
So...

746
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:42,820
...I've decided to start again.

747
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:46,526
I don't know what to do yet.

748
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:49,714
-Do you want me to help you?
-Really?

749
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:51,532
That'd be great!

750
00:41:52,715 --> 00:41:55,907
I don't think you are
a study type of person.

751
00:41:56,311 --> 00:41:58,223
What about modeling?
You have a good body.

752
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,914
-I have bow legs.
-Really?

753
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,906
-What about personal trainer?
-My shoulder is injured.

754
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:05,025
-A chef like me?
-I can't even cook fried egg.

755
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:06,817
Then,

756
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,810
an astronaut?

757
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,269
An astronaut?

758
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,167
That sounds good!

759
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:15,667
But I don't like helmet
because it's too stuffy.

760
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:20,005
Gosh, what are you good at?
Why aren't you good at anything?

761
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,301
You are right.

762
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,410
I guess I'm nothing without baseball.

763
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,816
I don't know, why I'm like this.

764
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:28,686
No, no.

765
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,376
I was just joking around.
Let's look for it again.

766
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:34,473
Then...

767
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,883
...is there anything you were good
at before playing baseball?

768
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:39,191
Thing I was good at?

769
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,486
I was awarded for a poem when
I was in elementary school.

770
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,597
-What? Poem?
-Yes.

771
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:45,572
-You wrote poems before?
-Yes.

772
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,070
I wanted to be a poet
before I played baseball.

773
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,054
Really?

774
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:53,855
Poet sounds nice.
Why don't you write a poem?

775
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:55,694
A poem...

776
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:01,592
-Come on.
-Welcome!

777
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,766
-Hello.
-Why did you bring me to gym out of blue?

778
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,972
I've done my research about Sangwoo.

779
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:09,466
He always comes to this gym,
and works out every evening.

780
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,065
-So get yourself register first.
-Me?

781
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:14,354
-Why?
-What do you think?

782
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,854
Don't you know repeated
coincidences become a relationship?

783
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:18,163
Think about it.

784
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:22,392
After seeing you at a dressing room,
he runs into you again at the gym he goes.

785
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:23,770
What would he think?

786
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:28,014
"Oh my god, I can't believe this.
How interesting." Wouldn't he think that?

787
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:30,301
-I'm not sure.
-Not sure, my ass.

788
00:43:30,396 --> 00:43:34,299
Anyway, if he keeps running in to you
like this, someday he will think...

789
00:43:35,665 --> 00:43:39,568
..."Perhaps, this woman is the one.
No, my destiny."

790
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,673
And he will keep thinking about you.

791
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,835
Before you realize, you guys will be
dating, wearing couple rings, proposing,

792
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:48,630
married, have a child, and become parents.

793
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:50,527
-Do you really think so?
-Of course!

794
00:43:50,622 --> 00:43:53,176
-But isn't this place really expensive?
-That's not the problem.

795
00:43:53,266 --> 00:43:54,972
You said, you wanted to be his girlfriend.

796
00:43:55,076 --> 00:43:57,377
-Never mind. Forget it.
-No, no!

797
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
I will do it.

798
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,249
How can a gym be this expensive?

799
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,852
I've lost all my expenses for this month.

800
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,046
I wonder,

801
00:44:09,138 --> 00:44:11,222
where is Sangwoo at?

802
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,319
There he is!

803
00:44:17,817 --> 00:44:20,792
Oh my, aren't you the
news anchor, Cho Sangwoo?

804
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:22,204
Yes.

805
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,912
-I am. And you are?
-I...

806
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,301
...am friend of Jungi that you
saw at broadcasting station.

807
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:28,697
I'm Kim Jeongeun.

808
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:32,884
-Hello.
-Oh, my.

809
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:36,883
How can we meet twice in a row by chance?
Unbelievable.

810
00:44:36,955 --> 00:44:39,169
You work out at this gym?

811
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,102
I've never seen you before.

812
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:43,911
Well... It's...

813
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:47,404
With spring here,
I wanted to start working out.

814
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:49,419
So I registered today.

815
00:44:50,013 --> 00:44:52,407
Today is your first day?
I'm quitting today.

816
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:54,402
-Pardon?
-Well, good luck with your work out.

817
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:56,195
No, I...

818
00:44:58,706 --> 00:45:00,706
Gee, my money...

819
00:45:02,484 --> 00:45:05,288
Die, you jerk. Die!

820
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:06,700
Stop it already!

821
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,716
-Do you think, I knew?
-Shut up!

822
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:11,827
What are you going to do with my money?
They don't do refund!

823
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:12,621
Hey.

824
00:45:12,724 --> 00:45:16,716
-That's enough.
-See? She said, enough. Stop it!

825
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,169
-That won't make him back to his senses.
-Yes, what?

826
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:26,565
-Make it quick with this.
-What?

827
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:30,729
-Hey, Lee Jungi!
-Gosh.

828
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:33,523
I wonder, when they will grow up.

829
00:45:33,618 --> 00:45:35,014
I know right?

830
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:38,506
What is this?

831
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:42,498
I guess this is Jungi's reporting script.

832
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:46,970
Wow, so this is how script looks like.

833
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,860
"Waikiki Guest House"

834
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,225
Hey,

835
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:57,527
let me know if you receive
any calls about event.

836
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,222
Okay, bye.

837
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,027
You still want to go
events after what happened?

838
00:46:03,122 --> 00:46:06,842
-I just need some money.
-Why so sudden? What for?

839
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,922
Nothing.

840
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:12,709
Yuri, Yuri!

841
00:46:12,805 --> 00:46:15,503
-Gee, what is this fuss all about?
-The thing is...

842
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,312
I've written a poem. Can you take a look?

843
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,114
Poem?

844
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,885
-What poem?
-Kibong wants...

845
00:46:21,996 --> 00:46:23,416
...to try to be a poet.

846
00:46:23,502 --> 00:46:25,819
-So you can write a poem, Kibong?
-Yes.

847
00:46:25,898 --> 00:46:26,992
Do you want to hear it out?

848
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:30,676
But don't laugh at it. It's been a while.

849
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:32,278
Okay, sure.

850
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,654
Title is "Are you that happy?"

851
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:43,335
By Kook Kibong.

852
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:46,455
"Are you okay now?"

853
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:48,861
"We've been through a lot."

854
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:50,352
"Our..."

855
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,844
"...final is..."

856
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,958
"...just a farewell."

857
00:46:56,242 --> 00:46:57,256
"But it was..."

858
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,345
"...too difficult for us."

859
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,647
Let me explain you about this part.

860
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:03,771
I've quit my baseball due to my injury.

861
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:06,966
So I expressed my feeling back
then as couple's break up.

862
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:10,657
It's pretty nice. Keep on going.

863
00:47:10,968 --> 00:47:11,665
Okay.

864
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,565
"Sometimes I heard,"

865
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,866
"you were doing great."

866
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,769
"You are..."

867
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:25,177
"...doing great with a nice guy you met."

868
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:27,272
"I didn't ask,"

869
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:28,970
"but you told me anyway."

870
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:32,489
I am telling this to
all my baseball gears.

871
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:35,394
I left it at training center,
and I heard it's fine.

872
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:40,739
I expressed how coach told me he gave
them to my junior, when I didn't even ask.

873
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:44,029
I see. You must be heartbroken.

874
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:47,274
Actually when I was writing this part,

875
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,059
it keeps reminding of my gears
so my heart was broken...

876
00:47:53,473 --> 00:47:54,266
Sorry.

877
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:56,268
Not again.

878
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:59,570
I will go and wash my face.

879
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:04,361
He is so big,

880
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:06,155
but so emotional.

881
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:08,052
-Don't you think?
-But Yuri,

882
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,766
doesn't it sound familiar?

883
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:11,344
-What?
-Me too.

884
00:48:11,552 --> 00:48:12,455
Wait,

885
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,740
isn't this from song lyrics?

886
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:19,154
It sounds similar from "Are
you happy?" by Kim Jongshin.

887
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:20,842
Yes, it is!

888
00:48:20,956 --> 00:48:22,956
♪ Are you okay now?

889
00:48:23,052 --> 00:48:26,051
♪ We've been through a lot. Our...

890
00:48:26,163 --> 00:48:28,757
♪ ...final is...

891
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:30,335
It's just same!

892
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:33,840
What? He thinks the song lyrics
is the poem that he wrote?

893
00:48:33,935 --> 00:48:35,339
I think he does.

894
00:48:35,435 --> 00:48:38,116
No wonder it sounds so fine.

895
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,520
Hey, just pretend you know nothing.

896
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:44,418
He is finally trying to do something new.

897
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:46,222
Let's not disappoint him.

898
00:48:46,316 --> 00:48:48,017
-Got it?
-Okay.

899
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:49,405
Yes, Yuri.

900
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:58,587
Jeongeun! Where is she? Jeongeun!

901
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,692
-Big news, big news, big news!
-What do you mean?

902
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:03,385
I've done some research
about Sangwoo again.

903
00:49:03,493 --> 00:49:06,585
I found that, he's active in a
club these days. And just in time,

904
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,481
today is regular meeting day.

905
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,870
-So what?
-What do you think?

906
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:13,078
You should sign up that club,

907
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:15,784
-and go make the coincidence.
-You and the coincidence.

908
00:49:15,864 --> 00:49:16,673
Hey, hey.

909
00:49:16,776 --> 00:49:20,270
About coincidences,
It has to occurred at least three times...

910
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:21,881
...for it to be a relationship.

911
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:25,554
It may seem like nothing
but it never fails on anyone.

912
00:49:25,648 --> 00:49:26,846
What kind of club is it?

913
00:49:36,747 --> 00:49:38,247
Your name is Jeongeun, right?

914
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:43,167
I never imagined for a woman
to join our alphorn club.

915
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:47,459
Were you interested in Swiss
traditional instrument, alphorn?

916
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:49,968
How fascinating.

917
00:49:50,064 --> 00:49:53,160
Not many people know about it.

918
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:58,965
Gee, where is Sangwoo?

919
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:01,349
What happened?

920
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,555
Sorry, I'm late.

921
00:50:05,738 --> 00:50:08,756
Oh, my. Sangwoo, we've met again!

922
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:10,255
Unbelievable!

923
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,550
I've been in this club for a while now.

924
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:15,128
-You two know each other?
-Well, yes.

925
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:18,525
-A little.
-I see.

926
00:50:18,628 --> 00:50:21,420
Well, you can teach Jeongeun.

927
00:50:21,608 --> 00:50:23,219
Well, why not.

928
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:25,417
That will be wonderful.

929
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:31,184
Yuri, Yuri! Wooshik.

930
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,303
I wrote another poem.
Would you like to hear it?

931
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:35,689
Poem?

932
00:50:36,193 --> 00:50:38,089
-You wrote another one?
-Yes.

933
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:42,237
I keep getting inspired,
so I can't keep myself still.

934
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,140
Is that so?

935
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:45,949
-Then, read it out to me.
-Okay.

936
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:47,454
Before that,

937
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:49,762
let me explain about this poem.

938
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:50,555
I...

939
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:54,059
...am a beast which
got hurt by baseball.

940
00:50:54,147 --> 00:50:58,038
so I am giving out a warning
message to not bother me anymore.

941
00:50:58,324 --> 00:50:59,625
Here me out then.

942
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,651
Title is "Roar".

943
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:07,739
By Kook Kibong.

944
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:09,031
"Yo!"

945
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:10,384
"Okay."

946
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:14,883
"I'm warning you just in case."

947
00:51:14,981 --> 00:51:15,981
"Listen carefully."

948
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:18,676
"It's dangerous now, so dangerous."

949
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:21,589
"Stop provoking me.
There's going to be a trouble."

950
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:24,778
"I don't even know myself. Hawl!"

951
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:28,763
"It's going to get..."

952
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:30,747
"...fierce from now on."

953
00:51:31,248 --> 00:51:32,652
"I'm..."

954
00:51:32,851 --> 00:51:35,549
"...growling, growling, growling."

955
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:39,576
"I'm growling, growling, growling."

956
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:42,178
"If you don't back away,"

957
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:45,282
"then I don't care if you get hurt."

958
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:51,433
-How was it?
-Wow, it was good.

959
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:53,743
-It got some tension.
-Right?

960
00:51:54,442 --> 00:51:56,342
I think I'm really talented with it.

961
00:51:56,427 --> 00:51:58,651
It doesn't even take me
30 minutes to write one.

962
00:52:00,444 --> 00:52:01,732
I just got inspired!

963
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:03,551
I should write more!

964
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,654
-Hey, brother. Wasn't it good this time?
-How was that good?

965
00:52:09,742 --> 00:52:11,330
That was EXO's "Growl".

966
00:52:11,418 --> 00:52:13,322
He just switched "Growl" to "Roar".

967
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:16,910
No wonder, I felt like I wanted to dance.

968
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:20,209
-Are you going to let him be like that?
-What else can I do?

969
00:52:20,294 --> 00:52:22,008
He works so hard.

970
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:26,189
It doesn't cost him money.
Just pretend, you don't know.

971
00:52:30,904 --> 00:52:32,410
Gosh, it's tiring.

972
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,625
I told you, that's not how you do it.

973
00:52:34,705 --> 00:52:37,664
-You are such a slow learner.
-I'm sorry.

974
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:40,363
What the heck am I doing here?

975
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,949
I'm getting scolded
for nothing by Sangwoo.

976
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:45,948
-Why is it so hard to blow?
-Let's...

977
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:47,775
...start again.

978
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,069
Jeongeun, put your strength on stomach,

979
00:52:50,154 --> 00:52:52,671
and exhale as if you are letting
all air out inside your body.

980
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:54,559
Try now.

981
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:58,180
That's right. Okay. Let's go.

982
00:53:01,856 --> 00:53:03,059
Harder than that.

983
00:53:03,461 --> 00:53:06,556
You are almost there. More. More!

984
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:31,356
I'm so humiliated in front of Sangwoo.

985
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:34,769
How can I fart at the
moment like this? How?

986
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,102
What are you doing over here?

987
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,502
What's up with your face?

988
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:52,416
Is it because of what happened just now?

989
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:54,399
Don't bother about it.

990
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:57,406
I farted a lot,
when I started to learn.

991
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,814
And your fart sound was cute.

992
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:02,827
Please stop. I'm already embarrassed.

993
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:04,518
Yes, I'm sorry.

994
00:54:04,717 --> 00:54:06,717
I just wanted to comfort you.

995
00:54:07,262 --> 00:54:10,657
By the way Jeongeun,
don't you think we have some connection?

996
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,959
Pardon?

997
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:13,658
-I don't know, what you mean.
-I mean,

998
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,468
we met at the broadcasting station,

999
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:17,199
we met at the gym,

1000
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:18,898
and alphorn club.

1001
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:23,104
It's fascinating to meet you
three times coincidentally.

1002
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:25,418
If you are free tomorrow,

1003
00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:28,005
do you want to go for a drive with me?

1004
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:28,806
Yes?

1005
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:30,910
Where did you buy this sausage from?

1006
00:54:31,006 --> 00:54:32,504
-It's good, right?
-Yes.

1007
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:39,562
-Where is Kibong?
-Kibong is writing a poem again.

1008
00:54:39,665 --> 00:54:42,562
He fidgeted all night by writing,
so I couldn't get a wink of sleep.

1009
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:45,466
And now he's searching
for literary contest.

1010
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:46,267
What?

1011
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:48,552
-Literary contest?
-Yes, that's right.

1012
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,440
Yuri, why don't we tell him the truth?

1013
00:54:51,941 --> 00:54:53,446
I want to but I'm scared,

1014
00:54:53,545 --> 00:54:54,263
he will be disappointed.

1015
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:57,239
It will be more disappointing
to know it later.

1016
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:01,745
-Okay, I will talk to him.
-Yes, you need to.

1017
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,545
Guys!

1018
00:55:05,645 --> 00:55:08,247
Ta-da! How do I look?

1019
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,749
Amazing.

1020
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:11,748
-Is today a dressing up as a woman day?
-What?

1021
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:12,948
Do you want to die?

1022
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:15,385
Where are you going dressed up like that?

1023
00:55:15,486 --> 00:55:18,883
I have a date with Sangwoo today.

1024
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:22,803
Gee, are you that happy?

1025
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:25,412
You know I helped you, right?

1026
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:29,420
Yes, it's all thanks to you.
Why do you even brag?

1027
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:31,437
-Why are you bringing that pipe?
-Hey!

1028
00:55:31,525 --> 00:55:33,924
This isn't a pipe! It's alphorn!

1029
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:35,430
It's a traditional musical
instrument of Swiss.

1030
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,932
This is an instrument?

1031
00:55:37,027 --> 00:55:39,328
No wonder,
it looks much longer than a pipe.

1032
00:55:39,527 --> 00:55:41,134
Where are you going to date?

1033
00:55:41,222 --> 00:55:43,150
We are going to Sangwoo's
mansion in Gapyeong.

1034
00:55:43,222 --> 00:55:45,332
Gapyeong? Mansion?

1035
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:48,204
How can you go to a trip,
when you guys just met? No way!

1036
00:55:48,305 --> 00:55:50,622
It's not a trip. We are coming back today.

1037
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:51,802
By the way,

1038
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:55,302
who do you think you are to say no?

1039
00:55:55,406 --> 00:55:58,019
Me? I'm your best friend.

1040
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:01,524
Of course, I want to let you go.
But you are like...

1041
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:04,234
...a child at water's edge.
So I feel anxious.

1042
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,532
Why don't you take care of yourself.

1043
00:56:06,826 --> 00:56:08,023
See you guys!

1044
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:09,941
Oh, god.

1045
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:14,638
Hey, I'm going for shooting.
What about my make up? Hey, Hey!

1046
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:16,417
This is why,

1047
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:18,998
I shouldn't be so generous.

1048
00:56:19,198 --> 00:56:20,904
Should I go instead of her, Jungi?

1049
00:56:21,008 --> 00:56:24,701
Today is my off-day and I want
to take a look at the set too.

1050
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,684
Really?

1051
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:27,993
That will be great for me.

1052
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:32,090
Kibong, shall we talk for a moment...

1053
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:35,486
I guess he's asleep.

1054
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:42,112
Gosh, I guess he fell
asleep while writing a poem.

1055
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,413
What did he write this time?

1056
00:56:49,758 --> 00:56:51,161
"Stylish as Gangnam"?

1057
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:54,473
"A girl who is warm and
humanly during the day."

1058
00:56:54,561 --> 00:56:57,363
"A classy girl who knows how to enjoy
the freedom of a cup of coffee."

1059
00:56:57,466 --> 00:57:00,453
"A girl with that kind of twist."

1060
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:04,056
"Oh, oh, oh I am as stylish as Gangnam."

1061
00:57:06,153 --> 00:57:08,627
This time is "Gangnam Style" by Psy.

1062
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:11,338
I almost danced "Horse
dance", while reading this.

1063
00:57:13,244 --> 00:57:14,727
What? Another one?

1064
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,304
"Momma Mia Rhapsody"?

1065
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:22,822
This is plagiarism of "Bohemian Rhapsody".

1066
00:57:22,927 --> 00:57:25,910
How can he plagiarize Queen?

1067
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:30,359
My gosh.

1068
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:37,592
♪ Momma, I'm sorry. Sorry, momma.
Rhapsody. Sorry, sorry, momma.

1069
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:41,029
He even synched with the melody.

1070
00:57:44,816 --> 00:57:47,740
So he saw the video of him.
Definitely, saw it.

1071
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,820
Alright!

1072
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:53,355
What should I do with him?

1073
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:03,089
So this is how they shoot.

1074
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:04,589
Amazing!

1075
00:58:04,987 --> 00:58:06,383
How is it amazing?

1076
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:09,503
Shall I practice first?

1077
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:13,487
Hello! The place I will introduce
today is Kal noodle restaurant,

1078
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:15,702
in Boryung, Chungnam...

1079
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:17,897
Gosh,

1080
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:19,204
what's up with my throat today?

1081
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:20,601
Really?

1082
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:23,709
-I will go and buy some water. Hold on.
-Water?

1083
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:26,288
Thank you, Suyeon.

1084
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:27,502
She's so nice.

1085
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:28,510
Jungi.

1086
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:29,597
Hello, producer.

1087
00:58:29,898 --> 00:58:33,104
Wow, who is she? I like her looks.

1088
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:35,184
-Is she an actress?
-No, she's just my friend.

1089
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:39,071
I see. Why did she come
instead of Jeongeun?

1090
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:41,072
Actually,

1091
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:44,200
Jeongeun and Sangwoo are
hitting off each other.

1092
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,799
They have gone for a date.

1093
00:58:45,903 --> 00:58:48,109
Really? But...

1094
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:50,505
...she better be careful of Sangwoo.

1095
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:52,785
-Why?
-He has some bad rumors.

1096
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:55,182
He brings women to mansion in Gapyeong,
saying that he will give them a tour.

1097
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:56,682
And cut off his contacts
after having fun with them.

1098
00:58:56,777 --> 00:58:59,078
We are going to Sangwoo's
mansion in Gapyeong.

1099
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,070
Pardon?

1100
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,365
What do you mean having fun with them?

1101
00:59:04,883 --> 00:59:07,445
Darn it, why don't you answer me?

1102
00:59:07,637 --> 00:59:10,040
What is going on with you?

1103
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:13,636
Gee, it's driving me insane.

1104
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:18,711
-Gosh, Kim Jeongeun.
-Hey, Lee Jungi.

1105
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:19,814
Where are you going?

1106
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,417
Hey, where are you going?

1107
00:59:25,263 --> 00:59:27,477
I need to tell Kibong.

1108
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,969
I'm afraid, he might be devastated.

1109
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:31,761
I'm going crazy. Seriously.

1110
00:59:34,622 --> 00:59:35,723
Hey, Kibong.

1111
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:37,034
What are you doing over there?

1112
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:38,334
Yuri...

1113
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:40,423
What is this song?

1114
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:41,723
Song?

1115
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:43,136
What song?

1116
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,059
Kibong...

1117
00:59:55,966 --> 00:59:57,948
You heard this song?

1118
00:59:58,073 --> 00:59:58,865
Yes.

1119
00:59:59,962 --> 01:00:01,676
Yuri, this song...

1120
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:07,361
...is really good.

1121
01:00:08,466 --> 01:00:09,869
-What is the name of this song?
-What?

1122
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:12,679
"Are you happy?" by Yoon Jongshin.

1123
01:00:13,503 --> 01:00:18,009
"Are you happy?" I've never heard
of this song, but it's really good.

1124
01:00:19,209 --> 01:00:20,597
But...

1125
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:23,838
...its lyrics is similar with my poem.

1126
01:00:24,149 --> 01:00:25,639
How amazing.

1127
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:27,250
What?

1128
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,933
Then, you...

1129
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,854
...never heard of it before?

1130
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:33,742
Yes.

1131
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:36,147
I was too into baseball,
I didn't have any interest in songs.

1132
01:00:36,243 --> 01:00:37,155
What about...

1133
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,648
"Growl" by EXO and
"Gangnam Style" by Psy?

1134
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:41,655
Also,

1135
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,664
what about "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen?

1136
01:00:43,752 --> 01:00:44,933
What are they?

1137
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:47,644
I've never heard of them before. Why?

1138
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:48,936
What?

1139
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:50,746
No...

1140
01:00:50,937 --> 01:00:51,832
It's nothing.

1141
01:00:53,636 --> 01:00:56,303
I really enjoy this song.

1142
01:00:56,432 --> 01:00:58,336
I should go and download it.

1143
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:02,539
What is going on?

1144
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,341
Then, he really...

1145
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:06,739
...wrote all the poems?

1146
01:01:13,054 --> 01:01:15,054
Jungi... What?

1147
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:21,454
-Where did Jungi go?
-I don't know. He just left.

1148
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:22,375
Pardon?

1149
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:26,367
-What are you saying?
-I need to finish the shooting by today.

1150
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:28,667
Where am I going to
get a reporter right now?

1151
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:30,810
Excuse me,

1152
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,311
didn't you say, you were friend of Jungi?

1153
01:01:32,407 --> 01:01:34,104
Yes.

1154
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:35,413
Why do you ask?

1155
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:39,868
Hello, viewers. I'm reporter, Han Suyeon.

1156
01:01:39,954 --> 01:01:43,257
The most popular segment of
"6PM My Hometown", "Oh, my."...

1157
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,448
..."How can this happen?
Oh, my. Oh, my."...

1158
01:01:46,557 --> 01:01:47,727
...will start now.

1159
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:52,326
-Let's go!
-Cut, okay! That was good!

1160
01:01:52,435 --> 01:01:54,935
-You are good at it.
-Yes, you are really good at it.

1161
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:56,330
She's better than Jungi.

1162
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:05,406
I sang all day long,

1163
01:02:08,295 --> 01:02:10,199
but I only earned 30,000 won.

1164
01:02:12,183 --> 01:02:14,975
How am I going to save up for
Suyeon's academy fee like this?

1165
01:02:16,786 --> 01:02:17,486
Hey,

1166
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,086
Suyeon!

1167
01:02:20,456 --> 01:02:21,963
Hey, Wooshik.

1168
01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:23,256
Where have you been?

1169
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:24,074
What?

1170
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,472
I just have business to do.

1171
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,869
-Why are you alone without Jungi?
-I don't know.

1172
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:31,136
He just said he couldn't do it and left.

1173
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:32,739
It was such a big mess.

1174
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:34,834
Did he cause some trouble again?

1175
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:36,134
I wonder.

1176
01:02:36,525 --> 01:02:39,042
I even reported instead of Jungi.

1177
01:02:39,128 --> 01:02:39,834
You did?

1178
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:43,531
Producer asked me urgently
so I had no choice.

1179
01:02:44,037 --> 01:02:46,653
Writers said I was good at it,

1180
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:48,544
and they will introduce
reporting job to me.

1181
01:02:48,648 --> 01:02:49,948
Really?

1182
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:51,543
It was quite fun.

1183
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:56,361
-I thought I could give it a try.
-Really? Hey...

1184
01:02:56,966 --> 01:02:57,663
Wait,

1185
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,981
then you no longer have to
go to news anchor academy.

1186
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:02,285
And I no longer have to go for events.

1187
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:04,387
What do you mean?

1188
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:06,692
-News anchor academy?
-Well...

1189
01:03:06,778 --> 01:03:08,078
It's nothing.

1190
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:10,591
Anyway, I'm so glad.

1191
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:12,884
-Good luck with it.
-Thank you.

1192
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:16,073
We have a good thing to celebrate,

1193
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,673
-shall we go get some hotteok?
-Hotteok?

1194
01:03:17,771 --> 01:03:20,175
Oh my god, yes! That sounds great.
Let's go, hurry!

1195
01:03:21,942 --> 01:03:24,655
-I want three, okay?
-Okay, got it.

1196
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:30,648
Shall we have some wine,
while watching the stars?

1197
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,437
You shouldn't drink and drive.

1198
01:03:33,538 --> 01:03:35,211
Then, we can sleep here
tonight and leave tomorrow.

1199
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,012
Pardon?

1200
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:42,796
Jeongeun, Jeonguen.

1201
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,861
-Jeongeun.
-Let me go.

1202
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:46,448
How are you going to go home?

1203
01:03:46,544 --> 01:03:49,050
I will go by myself so let me go.

1204
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,352
Hey!

1205
01:03:52,642 --> 01:03:54,745
-Let go of her!
-Jungi.

1206
01:04:00,788 --> 01:04:01,702
Jeongeun,

1207
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:02,898
are you okay?

1208
01:04:03,002 --> 01:04:05,414
-Did anything happen to you?
-No.

1209
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,802
How can you follow to a place like this?
You fearless fool!

1210
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,514
-How can you make me worry this much?
-Hey, Lee Jungi.

1211
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,085
What the heck are you doing?

1212
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:15,793
What about you? How petty.

1213
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:16,495
What?

1214
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:19,414
Jeongeun, let's go.

1215
01:04:22,311 --> 01:04:23,313
Gosh,

1216
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:27,724
I was just having fun because I'm bored.
Who does she think she is? She's nothing.

1217
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:39,749
I can't hold it anymore.

1218
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:41,448
Jeongeun,

1219
01:04:42,056 --> 01:04:43,255
wait over here.

1220
01:04:49,715 --> 01:04:51,413
-Sangwoo.
-What now?

1221
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:53,412
You need to get punched by me today.

1222
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:56,762
Are you crazy?

1223
01:04:56,842 --> 01:04:59,143
If you really want to see what's
crazy, why don't you talk more?

1224
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:01,247
You really want to quit your
job, aren't you?

1225
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,178
With one word of me, I can get you fired!

1226
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:05,875
Whatever.

1227
01:05:06,495 --> 01:05:09,194
I no longer want to do even you ask
me, you jerk.

1228
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:19,361
Let's go, Jeongeun.

1229
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:51,898
"Welcome to Waikiki 2"

1230
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,903
It doesn't make sense. I'm into Jungi?

1231
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,288
-I'm completely crazy!
-Did you do something wrong to me?

1232
01:05:58,383 --> 01:06:00,199
I need to write my resume.
Can you lend me your laptop?

1233
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:03,001
Let's see. No address...
What do you mean no address?

1234
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:04,582
I've never seen the owner of this place,

1235
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:06,096
so I've written it as no address.
Is it wrong?

1236
01:06:06,191 --> 01:06:08,000
Basic attitude of reporter is
having a good pronunciation.

1237
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,801
But they said, they can't work with a
girl without a basic attitude like me.

1238
01:06:10,897 --> 01:06:12,787
Do you know any reporter, Jungi?

1239
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:15,001
-I know one senior reporter.
-Hello.

1240
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:17,390
-Gosh, she spits so much.
-Ya, ya. No, no.

1241
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:19,864
I can't even say she is spitting so
much, when she's teaching me for free.

1242
01:06:19,952 --> 01:06:20,863
Pu!

1243
01:06:21,361 --> 01:06:22,563
Pu!
