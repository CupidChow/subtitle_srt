1
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:10,730
We're here.

2
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:17,473
Jeongpal, what are you doing?

3
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:18,669
Aren't you getting out?

4
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:20,365
Huh?

5
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,230
Yes, I should get out.

6
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:27,674
Were you really surprised?

7
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,882
Don't worry about it and
just sleep on it for today.

8
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:33,670
Okay?

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:35,547
Yes. Okay.

10
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,291
Let's head inside.

11
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:47,770
Let go of her!

12
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,443
Jungi.

13
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:53,162
Jeongeun,

14
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:54,223
are you okay?

15
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,114
Did anything happen to you?

16
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,072
How can you make me worry this much?

17
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:00,343
Jeongeun, let's go.

18
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,322
Lee Jungi.

19
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,212
I heard you disappeared
in the middle of the shoot.

20
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:17,431
What happened?

21
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:18,971
Well...

22
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,782
Something came up.

23
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:22,017
What?

24
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:24,468
Geez. You sure ask a lot of questions.

25
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:25,651
Mind your own business!

26
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,174
What are you going to do?
The producer seemed furious.

27
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:31,904
I just got a call from the writer.
She said I'm fired.

28
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,184
Didn't you attend
the shoot in my place today?

29
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,300
She said you were so good that
she wants to recommend you to others.

30
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,260
What?

31
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,412
It just turned out that way.

32
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:42,307
What are you going to do?

33
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:43,969
It's all right.

34
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:46,224
It didn't suit me anyway.

35
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,366
And you now what?

36
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:50,149
I think I'm more
of an actor than a reporter.

37
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:51,154
Actor.

38
00:01:52,865 --> 00:01:55,469
So don't worry about me and keep it up.

39
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:57,593
All right. Thanks, Jungi.

40
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,447
What was that sound?

41
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:06,623
Jeongeun's been at it for a while,
saying she's got a lot on her mind.

42
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:07,654
What do you mean?

43
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:14,407
I can't believe it.

44
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,328
Does this mean I've fallen for Jungi?

45
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,673
No.

46
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:21,752
There's no way.

47
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:23,970
It's impossible.

48
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:39,523
Does that make sense?

49
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:41,755
Why would I?

50
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:01,621
But...

51
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,594
Now that I look at him properly,
I guess he's not that bad.

52
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,181
What is he working so hard on?

53
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,482
A phone call?

54
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,706
Who could it be?

55
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,598
Is this Mr. Kook Kibong?

56
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,417
This is Good Morning Savings Bank.

57
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,543
Your credit card has been hacked.

58
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,685
There's no need to panic.

59
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,373
In order to fix it,

60
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,090
you should immediately wire 50,000 won,

61
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,738
to your friend, Lee Jungi.

62
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,598
He was prank-calling?

63
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,397
Yes, all right. Good bye.

64
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,180
He even wrote a script?

65
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,012
You fool.

66
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:47,383
I should've seen that coming.

67
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,685
Hello?

68
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:55,095
Is this Ms. Kim Jeongeun?

69
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,796
This is Good Morning Savings Bank.

70
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:58,215
Your credit card has been...

71
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,040
Hello?

72
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:01,310
Hello...

73
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:04,977
I must be out of my mind.

74
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:07,425
Where are you going?

75
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,130
I just got a call from
Good Morning Savings Bank.

76
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,199
They said my credit card's been hacked,
so I need to wire Jungi 50,000 won.

77
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:14,506
So I'm headed to the bank.

78
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:15,783
Kibong, you don't have to go.

79
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,265
What? Why?

80
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:18,718
Just forget it! Don't go.

81
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:21,277
I got the phone call too,
and they said they were able to stop it.

82
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,753
-Really?
-Yes.

83
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,480
Thank goodness.

84
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,503
I was worried sick.

85
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,332
Are you naive or stupid?

86
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:30,255
Hey.

87
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,397
Who are you calling stupid?

88
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:33,484
I'm not stupid!

89
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,191
Who does she think I am?

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,901
That was a good sleep.

91
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,128
What? Did you just wake up?

92
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,392
Yes. I stayed up all night searching...

93
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,046
...for what kind of supports
I could get from the government...

94
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:47,960
...once I open Yuri's Kitchen.

95
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,268
Oh, right. I need to write up a resume.

96
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,508
Can I borrow your laptop?

97
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,712
"Resume"?

98
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:54,383
What is it for?

99
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:55,700
I'm going to find a job.

100
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,523
My friend is going to set me up
with a job as a car dealer.

101
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,142
So he told me to send in
a resume and personal statement.

102
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:02,485
A car dealer?

103
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,606
Yes.

104
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:07,269
To tell you the truth,
I've always loved cars.

105
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:10,138
So I want to try working as a car dealer.

106
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,145
Is that so?

107
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:13,516
What about writing poems?

108
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,854
You said you wanted to be a poet.

109
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:16,024
The thing is...

110
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:19,152
Creative writing is too hard for me.
So I'm not going to do that.

111
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:20,704
Creative writing?

112
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:21,627
Yes.

113
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:23,758
You wouldn't know...

114
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,124
...how agonizing it is.

115
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:28,676
Growl...

116
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:29,769
Growl...

117
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:30,983
Growl...

118
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,919
He must have lost his mind.

119
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:43,119
Geez.

120
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,981
Isn't he too old to be making prank calls?

121
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,070
Why would I fall for someone like him?

122
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,516
What's up with him?

123
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,450
Why is he cleaning
when no one asked him to?

124
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:07,474
Then again, he can be a slacker,
but he's quite responsible sometimes.

125
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:11,366
What?!

126
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,918
Is he stealing money?

127
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:14,913
I did it!

128
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:23,564
Is he regretting what he just did?

129
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,382
Is he feeling guilty?

130
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,866
What? Why is he wiping it with tissue?

131
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,138
Don't tell me...

132
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,124
I almost left my fingerprints on it.

133
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,270
Now, it's all good!

134
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,154
I should've seen that coming.

135
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,274
I'm the idiot for expecting anything.

136
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:54,275
So you've never worked
as a reporter before?

137
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:55,945
That's right.
It's my first time.

138
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:57,509
Then where did you work before?

139
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:01,288
I worked part time as a promotional model
and waiter at a cafe.

140
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,025
What about a full-time job?

141
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,608
I've never had any.

142
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:09,842
Even though I'm inexperienced,
but I can be a great reporter.

143
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,466
When I set my mind to something,
I always do my best.

144
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:14,946
I'm sorry...

145
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,574
...but I don't think we can hire you.

146
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:18,508
Pardon me?

147
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:21,169
Well, why is that?

148
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:24,766
Is it because I'm not as experienced
as other people?

149
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:26,304
Do you think that's the reason?

150
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:27,840
Then what is it?

151
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,081
Please tell me.

152
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,881
You need to pronounce
"Please tell me" properly.

153
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,430
-I beg your pardon?
-Your pronunciation is wrong.

154
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,729
The correct pronunciation
is "I beg your pardon".

155
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,295
-Sorry?
-You still don't get it?

156
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,920
A reporter must deliver
accurate information...

157
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,687
...to the viewers in a precise manner.
And in order to do that...

158
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:46,801
having good diction is a basic skill.

159
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:49,911
Do I need to tell you other reasons?

160
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:52,274
You may leave now.

161
00:07:58,254 --> 00:07:59,532
What? You didn't get the job?

162
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:00,810
Why?

163
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,983
Reporters must have good diction.

164
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:04,754
He said he can't work with me
because I don't even have...

165
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,281
...that basic skill.

166
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,015
Really?

167
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:09,888
Don't get too dispirited.

168
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,426
You can find another job.

169
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,960
What do you mean?

170
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,387
I haven't given up yet.

171
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:15,324
What?

172
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:18,444
-Then what will you do?
-I'll practice hard and go back there.

173
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:21,690
I'll show him that I can accomplish
anything I put my mind to.

174
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:24,616
You sound very determined.

175
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:29,747
I don't think I'll be able
to do anything else if I give up on this.

176
00:08:30,414 --> 00:08:32,795
That's why I must get this job
and become successful...

177
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:34,486
...so that I can get our house back...

178
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,660
and pay off my dad's debt for him.

179
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,309
That's it.
Cheer up.

180
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:42,196
Thanks.

181
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:44,619
By the way, Wooshik...

182
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,289
...I think one more hotteok
will totally cheer me up.

183
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:56,578
I'm back!

184
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,501
That was so loud!

185
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,358
You startled me, you jerk.

186
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,090
By the way, what's that megaphone for?

187
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,098
This one?

188
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,065
I bought it because
I need it for something.

189
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,621
He bought the megaphone
with the money he stole?

190
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,657
What are you going to do this time?

191
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,717
There was money missing
from the cash register.

192
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:15,408
It was you, wasn't it?

193
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,044
No, I didn't even go anywhere
near the cash register.

194
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,356
What a liar.

195
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,727
We're back!

196
00:09:23,991 --> 00:09:26,950
Why are you so late?

197
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:28,258
Gosh, you startled me.

198
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:30,222
What are you up to now, punk?

199
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:31,667
Just leave him be.

200
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,193
Who knows what he's thinking?

201
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:36,036
Jungi, do you know any reporters?

202
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:39,040
I need to improve my pronunciation,
but I have no idea how.

203
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,267
Why do you need
to improve your pronunciation?

204
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,725
For a reporter job I've applied to.

205
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:46,728
I do know one personally.

206
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,831
She's a reporter as well as
a speech instructor.

207
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,185
Seriously?

208
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:52,234
Then can you introduce her to me?

209
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:54,680
"Hey, You Too
Speech Academy"

210
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,009
Hello.

211
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:01,415
Who are you?

212
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:03,693
Jungi introduced me to this place.

213
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:06,202
So you're Han Suyeon?

214
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,381
You come to improve
your pronunciation, right?

215
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,099
Yes. My pronunciation isn't that good.

216
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,560
You don't need to worry about that.

217
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,084
I'm an expert in this area.

218
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:16,886
Well, shall we get started right away?

219
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,112
Sure.

220
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:24,162
You can just repeat after me.

221
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:25,585
Flex your core.

222
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,612
And relax your shoulders.

223
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,484
Open your mouth as wide as you can.

224
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,623
Nice, that's great.

225
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:34,141
-Do it with confident. Okay?
-Yes.

226
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,384
Pay attention to the shape of my mouth...

227
00:10:36,473 --> 00:10:38,248
...and repeat after me.

228
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,755
Ga, gya, geo, gyeo,

229
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,772
go, gyo, gu, gyu, geu, gi.

230
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,932
Ga, gya, Geo, gyeo,

231
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,122
go, gyo, gu, gyu, geu, gi.

232
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:51,437
That was great.

233
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,849
Let's move on to "d" sounds.

234
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,708
Da, dya, deo, dyeo,

235
00:10:56,797 --> 00:11:00,020
do, dyo, du, dyu, deu, Di.

236
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:03,084
Hold on.

237
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,542
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

238
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,460
It's just...

239
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,890
This is a serious class.

240
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:11,573
Why do you keep blinking?

241
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:13,669
Please focus.
Pay attention.

242
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:17,196
Yes. I'm sorry.

243
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:20,551
All right.

244
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,072
The next one is "ch" sounds.

245
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:26,566
Pay attention to the shape of my mouth
and repeat after me.

246
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:29,508
Cha, chya, cheo, chyeo, cho, chyo,

247
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:32,602
-chu, chyu, cheu, chi.
-She's spitting so much.

248
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:36,056
You're doing that again.
Why do you keep doing that?

249
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,375
It's just that...

250
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:41,083
I can't even complain that she's spitting
on me because she's teaching me for free.

251
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:46,193
It's just because my vision is blurry.

252
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:48,250
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,007
Cha, chya, cheo, chyeo, Cho...

254
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:54,057
Cha, chya, chu, chyu, cheu, chi.

255
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,091
Now, we'll do "k".

256
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,382
Ka, kya, keo, kyeo, ko, kyo,

257
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:00,047
-"K" is a bit better.
-ku, kyu, keu...

258
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:00,963
Moving on to "t".

259
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:04,118
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo, to, tyo,

260
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,553
Tu, tyu, teu, ti.

261
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:08,951
What are you waiting for?

262
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,914
Repeat after me.

263
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:10,848
Sorry?

264
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:12,680
Okay.

265
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,790
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo,

266
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:19,218
to, tyo, Tu, tyu, teu, ti.

267
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:21,556
Why? What's wrong?

268
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,100
Everything sounds perfect,

269
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:27,103
except for the way you pronounce "Tu".

270
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,970
Pay attention to the shape of my mouth
and repeat after me.

271
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,874
Tu.

272
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,995
What are you waiting for? Repeat after me!

273
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:39,939
Sorry?

274
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:41,360
Yes.

275
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:45,345
-Tu.
-No, no.

276
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:47,034
That's not right.

277
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:48,229
Tu.

278
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:54,176
-Tu.
-That's not how you do it.

279
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:57,509
The tip of your tongue should touch
the back of your lower front teeth.

280
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:58,836
Then as if you're flicking your tongue...

281
00:12:58,925 --> 00:12:59,632
Tu.

282
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,427
Tu.

283
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:01,503
Tu.

284
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:09,159
Tu.

285
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,357
Stop wiping your face.
What if you end up scratching your skin?

286
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,694
I feel like I can still smell her saliva.

287
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,807
She sprayed almost a liter
of saliva on my face today.

288
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,041
That much saliva?

289
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,788
It wasn't casual spraying of saliva.
She practically spat on me.

290
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:27,431
Especially when she was saying "Tu",

291
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,175
I could clearly see her
saliva flying toward my face.

292
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:31,736
Gosh, it's so gross.

293
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,106
I should take a shower.

294
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:37,727
Yuri,

295
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,297
thanks for lending me your laptop.

296
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,732
No problem.
Did you finish writing your resume?

297
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,673
Yes.

298
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,109
Ta-da!

299
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,479
Can you have a look though?

300
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:46,519
Okay, sure.

301
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:50,791
Let's see. "Name, Kook Kibong".

302
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,899
Your phone number is correct.

303
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:56,160
Your date of birth, current address,
and permanent address...

304
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,937
"None"?

305
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,241
Why did you write "None"?
What does this mean?

306
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,349
Oh, that.

307
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,057
I've never seen the owner.

308
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:04,836
-That's why I wrote that.
-My gosh.

309
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,237
So you're saying,
you've never seen the owner,

310
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:09,670
-so that's why you wrote "None"?
-Yes.

311
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:10,765
Am I wrong?

312
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:12,425
Have I met the owner before?

313
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:14,206
Should I have written "Have met"?

314
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,893
-My goodness.
-Hey, that's not what this means.

315
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,785
What? Then what is the difference?

316
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:21,107
This one here...

317
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,126
Just forget it. Never mind.

318
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,572
Let's move on for now.

319
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:26,762
Shall I take a look at
your personal statement?

320
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,905
Hey, Kook Kibong!

321
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,045
Do you actually think
this can be your personal statement?

322
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,863
Why? Does it look weird?

323
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:33,972
What did he write?

324
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:35,772
I'll read it aloud for you. Listen.

325
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,880
"Hello, I'm Kook Kibong."

326
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,165
"My hobby is writing poems, and
my specialty is baseball."

327
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,566
"I wanted to be a pitcher
in the major league,"

328
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:44,984
"but I don't currently have any goal."

329
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:47,445
"My favorite food is sausage,"

330
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:50,076
"and my least favorite is spinach."

331
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:53,267
Open bracket, "I hate it.", close bracket.

332
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,907
"That's all I have to say about myself."

333
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:56,644
What do you think?

334
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,053
Hey, that's not how you
write a personal statement!

335
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:00,888
What about it?
It's a personal introduction.

336
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,341
That's what kids say when they
introduce themselves to classmates.

337
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,810
When you write a personal statement,
you have to highlight your skills,

338
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,112
as well as why they must hire you.

339
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,538
Would you want to hire yourself
if you read that?

340
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,003
Is that so?

341
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,296
I didn't know because
I've never written one before.

342
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:17,802
Then shall I rewrite it?

343
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,484
Of course you have to rewrite it.

344
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,041
This is useless.

345
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:22,798
Go rewrite it now.

346
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,607
I worked so hard on this.

347
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:26,730
"Waikiki Guest House"

348
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:43,718
I'm back.

349
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:49,674
What's going on?

350
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:51,416
Where did everyone go?

351
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,473
Why does he keep carrying
that megaphone around?

352
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,128
Why is he sleeping here again?

353
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:07,706
What the hell?

354
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,906
Is he putting a blanket over Kibong?

355
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:11,709
Then again...

356
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,536
He might be a little immature,

357
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,059
but he's also kind-hearted.

358
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,542
What?

359
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,115
Did he just fart?

360
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,215
Gosh, what's this smell?

361
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:25,556
Who is it?

362
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:27,255
-Who is this?
-Gas, gas, gas!

363
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:29,108
Jungi's gas time!

364
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,026
Hey, stop it!

365
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,510
Gosh!

366
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:34,923
I said, stop it, you lunatic!

367
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:37,661
I'm sorry. I'm just joking around.

368
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,666
Sorry.

369
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,949
I stayed up all night
writing the personal statement.

370
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:43,485
Okay. I get it.

371
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,706
I'll never do it again. Go back to sleep.
Sorry again.

372
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:47,276
My goodness.

373
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:48,389
Go back to sleep.

374
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:57,476
What is he doing?

375
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:58,734
Why is he coming back?

376
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:00,547
Don't tell me...

377
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,759
Wait, what happened?

378
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:08,764
Don't tell me...

379
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,779
I failed to control the strength.

380
00:17:16,023 --> 00:17:17,540
My guess was right.

381
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:21,028
Why did I fall for someone like him?

382
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,228
Alright. Now...

383
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:27,975
...we're done practicing the basic sounds.

384
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:30,420
Let's move on to sentence exercises.

385
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:32,679
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

386
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:35,208
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

387
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,585
There she goes again.

388
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:38,755
Ms. Han Suyeon.

389
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,855
Why do you keep blinking your eyes?

390
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,721
Try to focus! Pay attention!

391
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,496
If you have eye problems, go see a doctor.

392
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,055
Okay.

393
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:48,764
I'm sorry.

394
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:51,127
Next.

395
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,703
Why are there so many "Tu" sounds?

396
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:58,034
Pay attention to the shape of my mouth
and repeat after me.

397
00:17:58,123 --> 00:18:00,624
Look closely at the way my mouth moves.

398
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,849
Understand?

399
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,354
Is the movie I watched
yesterday "Alien 2",

400
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,415
"'RoboCop 2", or "Terminator 2"?

401
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:11,406
No. I watched "Back to the Future 2".

402
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:15,125
Is the movie I watched
yesterday "Alien 2"...

403
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:16,566
...or "RoboCop 2"?

404
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:19,395
No. I watched "Back to the Future 2".

405
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:22,434
You still can't say "Tu" clearly enough.

406
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,435
Look closely at my mouth.

407
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:25,575
Ma'am.

408
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:28,874
Can't I just practice "Tu" at home?
Please?

409
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:29,811
No, you can't.

410
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,332
When you practice pronunciation,

411
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:34,727
you need to see the correct
mouth shape to learn quickly.

412
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,270
Now...

413
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:38,104
...come closer...

414
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:39,530
...so that you can see it...

415
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,653
...clearer.

416
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,255
Is the movie I watched
yesterday "Alien 2"...

417
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,200
...or "Terminator 2"?
It's "Back to the Future 2".

418
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,864
Don't turn your face away from me.

419
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,263
Look closely at how my mouth moves!

420
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:54,625
All right.

421
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:56,812
I'll show you again.

422
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,174
Watch carefully.

423
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,484
Is the movie I watched
yesterday "Alien 2",

424
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,679
or "RoboCop 2"?
It's "Back to the Future 2".

425
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,562
Is Suyeon still at the academy?

426
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:08,715
It seems so.

427
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:11,001
She seems pretty determined this time.

428
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,651
How admirable.

429
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:16,085
I thought she was just a princess
from rich parents.

430
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,076
Yuri! Yuri! Yuri!

431
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:20,454
I wrote a new personal statement.
Can you take a look?

432
00:19:20,735 --> 00:19:21,569
You did?

433
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:23,735
Shall we take a look?

434
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:26,412
"Hello, my name is Kook Kibong."

435
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:30,193
"I am a fool who knew nothing
but baseball, for all of my life."

436
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:34,518
"Except for baseball, there was
nothing else I liked or was good at."

437
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:36,536
That's a pretty nice beginning.

438
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,016
It sure is.

439
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,110
"Since I only care about baseball,
some people even said..."

440
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,945
"...I'm someone with a boaring head."

441
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,972
Wait a second.

442
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,115
What do you mean by " boaring head"?

443
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,356
You don't know that phrase?

444
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:49,990
You have a boaring head.

445
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,756
Having a boaring head means...

446
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,925
...you are dull and not interesting.

447
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:54,869
Hey,

448
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,365
that's not "boaring head".

449
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:58,294
It's "boring".

450
00:19:58,602 --> 00:19:59,450
Really?

451
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,324
I must have misunderstood it.

452
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:02,891
I'll just fix it.

453
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:04,623
Let me just keep reading, for now.

454
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:08,805
"Despite that, there was one thing
I liked as much as I liked baseball."

455
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:09,756
"That is..."

456
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,204
"...cars."

457
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,057
"Even without someone telling
me to do teas and tab..."

458
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,573
Hold on. "Teas and tab"? What's that?

459
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:18,606
You don't know what that means?

460
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,855
It's when someone orders you
to do teas and tab,

461
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:23,596
it means they want you
to do various things.

462
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:24,450
Hey.

463
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,526
That's not "teas and tab".

464
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,026
It's "this and that".

465
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:30,140
No. It's "teas and tab".

466
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,035
I'm sure about this one.

467
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,673
Forget it.

468
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:34,976
Let's just skip that for now.

469
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,717
"Therefore, if you miss a talent like me
and regret it afterward,"

470
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,978
"it's the same as rocking the stable door
after the horse is stolen."

471
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,910
"Rocking the stable door
after the horse is stolen"?

472
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,275
What do you mean?
What is it this time?

473
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:45,145
It's a proverb. Proverb.

474
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,852
"To rock the stable door
after the horse is stolen."

475
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:50,914
Even if you rock the stable door
after the horse is stolen,

476
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,617
you can't get the stolen horse back.

477
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:54,471
Simply put, it means there's no point...

478
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,355
...in regretting when
the damage has been done.

479
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,198
What are you talking about?

480
00:20:58,287 --> 00:20:59,955
It's not "rocking the stable door".

481
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:01,982
It's "locking the stable door". Locking.

482
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,395
It's amazing how you know
the meaning and not the spelling.

483
00:21:04,488 --> 00:21:07,102
I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure it's "rocking".

484
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,655
I remember reading it in a book somewhere.

485
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,235
Gosh, my blood pressure is going up.

486
00:21:12,074 --> 00:21:13,905
I'll amend this. You go to your room.

487
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:15,076
Get out of my sight!

488
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:17,875
What? Stop telling me to do teas and tab.

489
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,103
I told you that's wrong!

490
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:21,737
Wooshik.

491
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:24,665
Get him out of my sight.

492
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,591
Right now!

493
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:27,231
Oh, okay. I got it.

494
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,391
Let's go.

495
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,525
She's really angry.

496
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,479
What's the big deal?

497
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,355
Don't you know that
failure is the father of success?

498
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:36,305
That little...
Come here.

499
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:37,269
You come here.

500
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,026
-What's wrong?
-Come here!

501
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,812
"Terminator 2".

502
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,756
"Terminator 2".

503
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,460
"Back to the Future 2".

504
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,351
"Back to the Future 2".

505
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:48,995
"Back to the Future 2".

506
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,806
"Back to the Future 2".

507
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:51,845
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo...

508
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:52,853
Ta, tya, teo, tyeo.

509
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,516
To, tyo, Tu, tyu, teu, ti.

510
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,460
-Ta, tya, teo, tyeo...
-To, tyo, Tu, tyu, teu, ti.

511
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:01,691
I'll take you to a really
nice place for lunch. How about...

512
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,126
-Excuse me.
-Gosh. You startled me.

513
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:04,555
What's the matter?

514
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:05,826
In today's Korean society,

515
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:08,695
many people make the mistake
of judging a person too fast.

516
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:11,395
Apparently, there is a
man who failed to see...

517
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:13,736
...a person's full potential
by judging her too fast.

518
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,195
Report Special Force met the man.

519
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,620
What are you doing right now?

520
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:18,833
I'm not done yet.

521
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,371
How much wood could Chuck Woods'
woodchuck chuck,

522
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,705
if Chuck Woods' woodchuck
could and would chuck wood?

523
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,205
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

524
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:26,716
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

525
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,404
Is the movie I watched yesterday
"Alien 2", "RoboCop 2", or "Terminator 2"?

526
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,722
"No. I watched 'Back to the Future 2'."

527
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,567
What do you think?

528
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,343
Do you still think
my pronunciation is bad?

529
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,903
Do you still think I can't be a reporter?

530
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:41,966
Guys!

531
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:43,996
Guys!

532
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:45,437
You're back?

533
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,985
How did it go?

534
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,801
I got in.

535
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,705
The director of the broadcasting
station wanted to hire me.

536
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:54,059
-Really?
-Yes. I'm on a one month probation.

537
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:55,941
They'll decide later whether
to hire me as a reporter.

538
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,792
Han Suyeon, you did it.

539
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:59,679
I told you I can accomplish
anything I put my mind to.

540
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:02,046
Right. They say a face can move mountains.

541
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:04,038
Suyeon, you must be so thrilled.

542
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:06,210
What?
"A face can move mountains"?

543
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,326
Yes, if a person works hard enough,
good things will happen.

544
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,255
They can achieve anything with hard work.
You don't know the proverb?

545
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,775
That's "faith", not "face".

546
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,288
Kook Kibong,

547
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:17,978
you stay right where you are.

548
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,036
What's wrong?

549
00:23:20,124 --> 00:23:21,336
I made a mistake, so what?

550
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:23,144
Come here. Come here right now!

551
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,195
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

552
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:28,536
It's the same as rocking the stable door
after the horse is stolen.

553
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:30,023
I told you it's wrong!

554
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:31,166
You're dead today.

555
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,769
Come here! Come over here.

556
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,114
-Come here.
-Don't use it if you're not sure.

557
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,885
Why is he so stubborn?

558
00:23:37,973 --> 00:23:39,144
I know.

559
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,029
By the way, where is Jungi?

560
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:43,985
I'm not sure. He went out with
the megaphone a while ago.

561
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,299
What is he up to these days?

562
00:23:46,547 --> 00:23:48,019
Jeongeun, do you have any idea?

563
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:50,434
I don't. Why would you ask me about Jungi?

564
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,364
What's with her?
Why did she have to snap like that?

565
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,012
Why would he ask me about Jungi?

566
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,883
How can I have feelings for such an idiot?

567
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:04,983
I must be out of my mind.

568
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,491
"Crazy Jungi"
Why is he calling me?

569
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:11,391
What?

570
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,298
Jeongpal.

571
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:13,419
Meet me outside.

572
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:14,850
Outside? Why?

573
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:16,787
You'll find out when you come out.

574
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:17,968
Hurry up!

575
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,903
Why does he want me to come
out at this late hour?

576
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:30,268
What is it? What do you want?

577
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:31,414
Give me just a second.

578
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,436
What are you doing? Come here right now!

579
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:41,557
What is he doing here?

580
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,851
Just wait.

581
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,714
What are you waiting for?

582
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:57,341
Go ahead.

583
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:58,936
Fine.

584
00:25:00,362 --> 00:25:02,308
Jeongeun, I'm sorry.

585
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,342
I shouldn't have done it.

586
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:09,068
-Are you happy now?
-"Are you happy now"?

587
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:11,417
You call that an apology?

588
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:15,509
It didn't sound sincere at all.

589
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:18,174
I guess I have no choice.

590
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:23,784
Attention!

591
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,890
The famous news anchor, Cho Sangwoo,

592
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:28,090
hit on my innocent friend...

593
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:29,475
I'm sorry, Jeongeun.

594
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:31,569
I must have been out of my mind.

595
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,818
It'll never happen again.

596
00:25:33,923 --> 00:25:35,505
Please forgive me this once.

597
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:37,821
I get it, so just leave.

598
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:40,331
Thank you.

599
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,973
Are we done now?

600
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:48,705
You can't protest in front of
the broadcasting station anymore, okay?

601
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,079
Okay.

602
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:54,646
I'm only letting you get away
because my friend says it's okay.

603
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,798
If you ever bother my innocent friend...

604
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:57,924
No...

605
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,203
If you act like that to women again,

606
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:04,646
I'm going to make a fuss about it
on the news instead!

607
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:05,639
Understand?

608
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,898
Okay.

609
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,641
I'm leaving. Okay?

610
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:10,799
Jeongeun, bye.

611
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:16,191
Good job!

612
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:19,382
Hey,  Lee Jungi.

613
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:20,409
What was that?

614
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:21,355
Well...

615
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,976
He didn't even apologize to you properly.

616
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:27,005
How was it?

617
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:28,647
Are you feeling better?

618
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:32,799
And oh...

619
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,005
If someone harasses you again,

620
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:36,961
come and tell me.

621
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:40,501
I'm going to completely smash
those who bother my friend!

622
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:43,572
Okay?

623
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:47,226
Great.

624
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,133
Let's go home now, friend.

625
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,604
Hello, everyone.

626
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:32,582
This is Han Suyeon
from Report Special Force.

627
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,953
Today, I'm here to meet
the world renowned conductor,

628
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:38,449
of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,
Park Chulhong, who has started...

629
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,641
a new chapter in his life
by becoming the owner of a sheep farm.

630
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,801
-How was it?
-I like it!

631
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,843
It was good.

632
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:45,685
Yes, you sounded like a real reporter.

633
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:46,628
Really?

634
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,172
I stayed up all night
practicing for the first shoot.

635
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,474
I'm still so nervous.

636
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:54,309
Don't be. You'll be fine.

637
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:55,410
Thanks.

638
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,104
Ta-da! How do I look?

639
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:00,440
Wow! You look terrible.

640
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:02,300
It looks like you've
stolen your dad's suit.

641
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,331
Really?

642
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,509
I guess it's because I've only
been wearing baseball uniforms.

643
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:07,928
What's with the suit though?

644
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:11,317
It's your first day at work too, isn't it?

645
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:14,260
I finished my training yesterday
and it's my first official day.

646
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:17,665
I guess there are two people in our house
that are starting work today.

647
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:19,826
Both of you be careful
not to make any mistake and do well.

648
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:20,889
Especially..

649
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:23,142
-...you. Kibong.
-All right.

650
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:25,787
I'm late! I'm leaving now.

651
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:28,177
-Good luck!
-Kibong, wait for me!

652
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,905
I have to catch the express bus.

653
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:31,675
The express bus? Where's the shoot?

654
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,816
-Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do.
-Pyeongchang?

655
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,862
Should I give you a ride?

656
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:36,838
You?

657
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,060
Didn't you say you have an event today?

658
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:43,025
It just happens to be near Pyeongchang.

659
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:44,478
I'll drop you off on the way.

660
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,870
I told you to stop practicing
and get some sleep.

661
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:03,905
How are you going to manage
when barely slept last night?

662
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,074
It's okay. I'll be fine soon.

663
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:12,614
Anyways, thanks for the ride.

664
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:13,689
No problem.

665
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,008
I'm just dropping you off on the way.

666
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:18,702
By the way, what time do you finish?

667
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,407
I'll pick you up afterward.

668
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:22,495
No, it's fine.
I don't want to trouble you.

669
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:24,625
-I'll get back by myself.
-What do you mean, trouble me?

670
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,571
It's right around the corner.

671
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,288
Alright, then.

672
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:30,420
I'll call you when it's over.

673
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,245
-See you.
-Okay. Good luck.

674
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,014
-Han Suyeon, you can do it!
-I can do it!

675
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:43,821
Yes, hello?

676
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,114
Me?

677
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:46,673
I'm on my way to the event.

678
00:29:46,914 --> 00:29:48,534
There's a lot of traffic.

679
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:50,906
I'm right around the corner.

680
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:52,488
I'll be there soon.

681
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:55,178
Gosh, I'm late!

682
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,252
How's the mileage on this car?

683
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,207
The mileage?

684
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,717
Well, that's...

685
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:03,020
It was...

686
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:04,583
They said it's quite good.

687
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:07,743
So how far will it go per liter?

688
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:08,965
Per liter?

689
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:11,621
Just a minute, sir. I...

690
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:14,945
This is so annoying.

691
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,234
Forget about it.

692
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,816
Sir! The mileage is...

693
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,135
16, no...

694
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:23,056
20 or 30...

695
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:24,010
Kook Kibong!

696
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:26,525
What are you doing?

697
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:28,726
How can you call yourself a dealer
and not know the mileage?

698
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:31,152
Do you realize how many
customers you lost today?

699
00:30:32,153 --> 00:30:34,594
-I'm sorry.
-You think an apology can settle this?

700
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:37,384
Make sure to sell a car today
no matter what.

701
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,466
If you can't, don't even think
about coming back tomorrow.

702
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:40,806
-What?
-Got it?

703
00:30:40,894 --> 00:30:42,531
Yes, sir.

704
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,061
How did we end up with him?
This is so annoying.

705
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:48,554
Yes, Mr. Kim.

706
00:30:49,503 --> 00:30:51,357
This is driving me crazy.

707
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:01,972
What are you so focused on?

708
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,411
This?

709
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,466
This is the government website
for the Youth Business Support.

710
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:09,929
I was wondering if I can get support
when I set up my business.

711
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,731
There's something called
the Youth Business Support?

712
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:12,961
Yes, I guess so.

713
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,143
I see.

714
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,026
What is Jeongeun doing in her room?
She hasn't even eaten.

715
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:21,709
Hold on.

716
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,255
Oh my god.
You surprised me.

717
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,935
Do you think I'm a ghost or something?

718
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,442
Why would you get surprised?

719
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:32,578
-Come out and eat.
-No thanks! You eat all you want.

720
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:33,967
What are you getting mad at me for?

721
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:35,496
When did I get mad at you?

722
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:36,891
You've got to be kidding me.

723
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:39,063
What?

724
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:40,401
That little...

725
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:42,274
What did I do?

726
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:44,634
Your presence itself
is usually the mistake,

727
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,672
but there must be something else you did.

728
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,660
No, there isn't.

729
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,943
I didn't do anything.

730
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,543
Then why would she act that way?

731
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:53,844
Anyways, I'll go find out
more about this support,

732
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:55,444
so go on in and apologize to her.

733
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:57,545
Bye.

734
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,853
Okay. Bye.

735
00:32:01,994 --> 00:32:02,979
No, there isn't.

736
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,856
I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong.

737
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:09,963
Jeongpal?

738
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,315
What do you want?

739
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,426
Did I do something
wrong, by any chance?

740
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:22,671
That's not it.

741
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:24,819
Then why are you acting this way?

742
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:26,944
What is it? Tell me.

743
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:28,923
Is it because...

744
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,485
...I added soy sauce in your coke?

745
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,501
What?
That was you?

746
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:35,085
It's not because of that?

747
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,066
Then it must be because...

748
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,221
...I played ice-hockey
with your shoe today?!

749
00:32:41,483 --> 00:32:42,754
You did that, too?

750
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,056
It's not because of that, either?

751
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:46,638
Then it's must be this one!

752
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,631
I know. I know. I got it. Gosh.

753
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:53,691
Here. I'll return it. Are we good now?.

754
00:32:54,124 --> 00:32:57,123
Your wallet was in the kitchen,
so I couldn't help it.

755
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:59,330
-You even stole my money?
-I didn't steal it.

756
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,217
I'm borrowing it.
I just didn't tell you.

757
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:03,614
I returned it, so we're good, right?

758
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:04,820
Come on, don't be angry.

759
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:06,824
Whatever. Just leave.

760
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:08,264
Get out!

761
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:11,303
This is too much.

762
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:14,241
Fine. All right.

763
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:18,257
I took some last time, too.

764
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:20,513
I'll give it back. Okay?

765
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:25,386
Today, I'm with the New
York Philharmonic...

766
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,622
Why is my voice so hoarse?

767
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,603
And I'm so sleepy.

768
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,299
Suyeon, are you ready?

769
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,602
Yes, I am.

770
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:41,431
You've been boasting that you'll do well
in front of the chief director.

771
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,508
Let's see how well you do.

772
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:45,833
I'll try my best.

773
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,459
But where is Mr. Park?

774
00:33:48,553 --> 00:33:49,932
I want to do a pre-interview.

775
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:50,895
Is that so?

776
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:52,886
There he is.

777
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:10,892
Hello, sir.

778
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:13,031
I'm the interviewer for today, Han Suyeon.

779
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:19,103
Hello.

780
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:24,708
Thank you for coming...

781
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:29,788
...all the way here.

782
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:31,500
What's this?

783
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:33,219
Why does he talk so slow?

784
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:37,472
I look forward to the interview today.

785
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:38,650
Yes.

786
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:39,798
Sure.

787
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,863
But...

788
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:45,437
...it's been...

789
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:47,845
...such a long time...

790
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:53,097
...since I've had an interview...

791
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,723
...so I'm so nervous.

792
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:58,538
My eyes...

793
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,248
...might get wide...

794
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:03,141
...and I might...

795
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:04,946
...speak too fast.

796
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:07,657
I'm in quite...

797
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:12,433
...a sensitive state...

798
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:17,233
Suyeon.

799
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:18,619
Suyeon!

800
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:19,949
What?

801
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,597
Suyeon, were you dozing off?

802
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:26,227
I'm sorry.

803
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:29,366
To be honest, I was practicing all night
so I didn't get much sleep.

804
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:33,109
Sir, we'll begin right away, then.

805
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,042
Let's go.

806
00:35:34,853 --> 00:35:36,110
I'm sorry.

807
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:37,372
It's fine.

808
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:46,004
This is driving me crazy!

809
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:48,776
But he looks so sleepy and
his voice makes it worse.

810
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,903
He's practically a human sleeping pill!

811
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,177
Han Suyeon!

812
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:55,039
Wake up. Focus.

813
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:01,167
What? I ran out of it.

814
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,403
"Buy a new lotion"

815
00:36:20,153 --> 00:36:22,993
"Lee Jungi"

816
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:25,552
Come to think of it,
why does it have to be Lee Jungi?

817
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:28,685
Do I have feelings for him?

818
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:29,785
"Do I have feelings for him?"

819
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:30,786
Me?

820
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,304
Am I going crazy?

821
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:35,371
No.

822
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,818
No. No.

823
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,824
No. No. No. No. No.

824
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,547
Jeongpal, come out for a second!

825
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:43,369
-Hey, Kim Jeongpal!
-Why is he calling me again?

826
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm already so uncomfortable around him.

827
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:52,131
What now?

828
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:53,875
You got a package. Over there.

829
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:54,837
A package?

830
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:01,450
Kim Jeongpal!

831
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,986
Are you... Are you all right?

832
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:06,053
My back...

833
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,255
My back!

834
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:09,208
Why did you run?

835
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:10,775
Can you move?

836
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:11,972
Try to move.

837
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,365
I can't move at all.

838
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:15,531
That's not good.

839
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:17,065
Should I take you to the hospital?

840
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,313
There's no need.

841
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,636
Just take me to my room.

842
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:20,578
Okay.

843
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:22,955
Come here.

844
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,983
Goodness.

845
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,287
My back...

846
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,456
Be gentle!

847
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,229
I am being gentle.

848
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,994
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the hospital?

849
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,918
No, I'm fine. I can just put on
a pain-relieving patch.

850
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:41,895
Where is it?

851
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:44,032
Over there,
in the dressing table drawer...

852
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:48,158
"Lee Jungi
Do I have feelings for him?"

853
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,066
"Me?"

854
00:37:49,154 --> 00:37:50,245
"Am I going crazy?"

855
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:51,935
In the dressing table drawer?

856
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:53,406
I'll get it for you.

857
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,866
No, no. I just remembered
that I used it up.

858
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:59,275
So... can you go out,

859
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,294
and buy a pack of
pain-relieving patches for me?

860
00:38:01,483 --> 00:38:02,977
Sure, I'll be right back.

861
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:03,927
Okay.

862
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:10,031
I cannot let Jungi see that.

863
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:11,558
I need to get rid of it now.

864
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:13,825
Ouch, my back...

865
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:15,984
Fine.

866
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:17,255
I have no choice.

867
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:19,121
One...

868
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:20,172
Two...

869
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:21,598
Three.

870
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:34,325
I got the patch.

871
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,105
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

872
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:38,602
I'm...

873
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,483
Do you need something?
Shall I find it for you?

874
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:41,633
Don't come!

875
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:44,337
Why are you yelling at me?

876
00:38:44,426 --> 00:38:45,655
When did I yell?

877
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:48,816
I crawled down because I was bored.

878
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,811
Jungi, can you take me back to the bed?

879
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:52,968
Sure.

880
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:56,993
Come here. Be careful with your back.

881
00:38:57,082 --> 00:38:58,336
Ouch. Be careful.

882
00:38:58,424 --> 00:38:59,434
I got it.

883
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,755
Why did you crawl down
to the floor to begin with?

884
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:12,696
Shall I put this on for you?

885
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:15,064
No, I'll do it myself. You can leave now.

886
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:16,685
-Go on.
-Call me if you need anything.

887
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:17,615
-Okay.
-All right.

888
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,029
I was so close.

889
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:25,594
This is driving me nuts.

890
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:30,651
Why isn't anyone coming in?

891
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:33,755
I have to sell a car
before the end of the day.

892
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,186
Hello, ma'am.

893
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:42,703
"Official Dealer
Kook Kibong"

894
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,271
I'm here to take a look at a car.

895
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:46,045
Is that so?

896
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,425
What kind of car are you looking for?

897
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:51,584
A compact car? A midsize sedan? An SUV?

898
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:52,971
Or an electric car?

899
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,395
Please tell me what you're looking for.

900
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:56,663
I actually already have a model in mind.

901
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:58,197
Oh, that one over there.

902
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:00,895
Would I be able to do a test drive?

903
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,810
Of course, ma'am.

904
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,536
We can stop by at a grocery store, right?

905
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,736
I have to buy a few things.

906
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,542
Pardon?
Well, that's...

907
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,729
Yes, of course.

908
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,214
My gosh, thank you very much.

909
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:14,745
You can put everything on the table.

910
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,055
Yes, ma'am.

911
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,036
By the way, when would you like
to sign the purchasing contract?

912
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:22,660
Well...

913
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:25,436
-I need more time to think.
-Pardon me?

914
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:28,379
Well, I'll get going then.

915
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:30,769
I was just kidding.

916
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:32,516
How could I not buy the
car after all this?

917
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:33,576
Bring the contract.

918
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,689
Really?

919
00:40:35,222 --> 00:40:36,224
Thank you.

920
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:37,761
Thank you, ma'am!

921
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:40,343
I'm home.

922
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:44,535
Who's this guy?

923
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:48,401
Hello, sir. I'm a dealer from
Kisung Motors, Kook Kibong.

924
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:49,834
A dealer?

925
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,920
What's going on?
Honey, are you really buying a car?

926
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:54,455
-Yes.
-I told you that you can't.

927
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:56,405
You spend the whole day at home.
Why do you need a car?

928
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:58,092
I certainly need a car.

929
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:00,194
I have to pick up our kids
and buy groceries.

930
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:01,775
I need it for many reasons.

931
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:04,109
When I said no, it means no.

932
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,083
Excuse me.

933
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,833
-We're not buying, so please leave.
-Sorry?

934
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,614
Oh, okay.

935
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:10,724
Gosh, where are you going?

936
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,632
If you leave now,
I won't sign the contact.

937
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,525
-Pardon me?
-Honey, are you provoking me?

938
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,995
Follow me.

939
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:19,201
As if.

940
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,419
Do you think that will scare me?

941
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:25,432
Gosh, wait. Ma'am, then what should I...

942
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,163
Is she going to sign the contract or not?

943
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,621
"Sheep Farm"

944
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,617
Sir, I'm curious about something.

945
00:41:42,706 --> 00:41:44,351
You were a world-renowned conductor.

946
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,529
What inspired you to start a sheep farm?

947
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:52,369
I started it...

948
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:54,953
...because...

949
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:57,325
...I love...

950
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:01,289
...lamb skewers.

951
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:04,382
I see.

952
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:09,021
This must be the sheep pen.

953
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,330
They're so cute.

954
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:20,716
I always look after them with love.

955
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:24,670
That's probably why.

956
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:28,746
No.

957
00:42:28,835 --> 00:42:29,869
I can't doze off.

958
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,262
Wake up, Han Suyeon.

959
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:34,349
Oh, I see.

960
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,388
How many sheep do you own in total?

961
00:42:39,146 --> 00:42:40,859
Well, I'm not sure.

962
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:46,254
I don't know the exact number.

963
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:50,115
Shall we...

964
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:52,985
...try counting them?

965
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,805
One sheep.

966
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:02,882
Two sheep.

967
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:06,660
Three sheep.

968
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:10,403
Four sheep.

969
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:13,756
Five sheep.

970
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:16,902
Six sheep.

971
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:19,871
Seven sheep.

972
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:21,844
Han Suyeon, what are you doing?
Did you doze off again?

973
00:43:21,937 --> 00:43:24,769
Eight sheep.

974
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:29,046
-Nine sheep.
-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

975
00:43:29,134 --> 00:43:31,315
What's wrong with you?

976
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:32,875
I'm really sorry.

977
00:43:32,964 --> 00:43:34,018
Han Suyeon,

978
00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:35,636
this is your last chance.

979
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,755
Understand?

980
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:38,649
Yes. Got it, sir.

981
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,871
Thirteen sheep.

982
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,414
Then let's get a divorce.

983
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:48,755
Fine, let's do that. Let's get a divorce!

984
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:50,875
Darn it. This is crazy.

985
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:54,554
I can't just leave.
What am I supposed to do?

986
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,262
Mom, I'm home.

987
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:00,620
Who are you?

988
00:44:01,693 --> 00:44:03,478
I sell cars.

989
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:05,901
I stopped by because
your mom said she wants to buy a car.

990
00:44:08,463 --> 00:44:09,432
Mom!

991
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,425
Mom!

992
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:13,786
-What is it?
-I have to do my homework.

993
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:14,945
Can you help me with it?

994
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,788
What? Your homework?

995
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,778
Excuse me.

996
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,781
I'm sorry to ask you this,

997
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,011
but can you help him?

998
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,425
Sorry? Me?

999
00:44:22,514 --> 00:44:25,812
I can't sign the contract until
I finish talking with my husband.

1000
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:27,251
Do you not want to sell the car?

1001
00:44:27,954 --> 00:44:30,143
No, it's not that. I'll help him.

1002
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:31,599
Get back to your conversation, ma'am.

1003
00:44:36,653 --> 00:44:38,421
This is driving me crazy.

1004
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:43,427
Kid,

1005
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,136
what's your homework?

1006
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:51,689
I have to make something
with these straws.

1007
00:44:51,778 --> 00:44:52,616
Well...

1008
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,847
What do you need to make with these?

1009
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,308
Please make it exactly like this.

1010
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:05,382
You want me to make
that with these straws?

1011
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:06,506
Can I make something else?

1012
00:45:06,595 --> 00:45:09,636
No! I want you to make this!

1013
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:11,599
Make this for me!

1014
00:45:12,124 --> 00:45:14,289
-Make this for me!
-Fine, fine.

1015
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,958
-I'll make it for you.
-For real?

1016
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:26,785
Almost there. Almost...

1017
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,327
Jeongeun, is there anything to wash...

1018
00:45:37,587 --> 00:45:39,969
Why are you out of your bed again?

1019
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:41,048
Well,

1020
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:42,862
I wanted to look in the mirror.

1021
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,735
Why would a sick person
want to look at the mirror?

1022
00:45:44,823 --> 00:45:47,021
You're just ugly as usual.

1023
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:49,131
Let me carry you to the bed again.

1024
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:53,178
Watch your back.

1025
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:55,482
-Take it easy.
-All right.

1026
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,894
1, 2, 3.

1027
00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:00,920
Ouch, my back!

1028
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:02,137
My butt!

1029
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,080
My butt!

1030
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:06,565
How much do you weigh, really?
You're heavy like a rock.

1031
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:08,290
-What?
-Never mind.

1032
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:10,574
Come here. Let's try again.

1033
00:46:11,526 --> 00:46:12,965
I can't straighten my body.

1034
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:14,109
Come here.

1035
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:16,125
1, 2...

1036
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,655
Gosh.

1037
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:24,656
Where's the note?

1038
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:25,758
Kim Jeongpal,

1039
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:27,587
stay right here in your bed from now on.

1040
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:28,572
Got it?

1041
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:29,888
Okay.
Go out now.

1042
00:46:29,977 --> 00:46:32,635
You're an enemy, not a friend.

1043
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:38,537
What?

1044
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:40,610
How did that end up there?

1045
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:45,005
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1046
00:46:46,256 --> 00:46:47,122
Uncle...

1047
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:48,543
...can you make the turtle ship...

1048
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:51,269
...to spit fire?

1049
00:46:51,505 --> 00:46:52,359
Fire?

1050
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:55,139
Okay. I'll do my best.

1051
00:46:56,543 --> 00:46:57,908
I'm home.

1052
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:00,532
What's going on?
Who are you?

1053
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,633
I'm a car dealer.

1054
00:47:02,722 --> 00:47:04,646
Your mom wants to buy a car.

1055
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:06,247
I that so?

1056
00:47:06,453 --> 00:47:08,159
-Where's M and D?
-"M and D"?

1057
00:47:08,398 --> 00:47:10,123
-What do you mean?
-Mom and Dad.

1058
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:11,570
M and D for short.

1059
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:12,496
Mom and Dad?

1060
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:14,565
Is there anything you've done for me?

1061
00:47:14,653 --> 00:47:16,633
-What? They're fighting again?
-What are you talking about?

1062
00:47:16,722 --> 00:47:18,313
Gosh, I can't believe this family.

1063
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,895
It's a total mess.

1064
00:47:19,983 --> 00:47:22,605
-MLF.
-"MLF"?

1065
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:25,023
My life is a failure.

1066
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:26,807
I was already having a bad day.

1067
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:27,767
Gosh.

1068
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:29,164
Hey.

1069
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:30,998
Hey.

1070
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:33,518
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to run away. Why?

1071
00:47:33,752 --> 00:47:34,605
You're going to run away?

1072
00:47:34,694 --> 00:47:36,439
Why? Why would you do that?

1073
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:38,206
Tell me the reason.

1074
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:42,090
So your best friend...

1075
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:44,795
...had an ice cream
with another girl at the cafeteria...

1076
00:47:44,883 --> 00:47:46,623
...without telling you?

1077
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:48,780
Yes. Isn't that absurd?

1078
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:50,430
What makes me angrier is that,

1079
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,996
after third period,
they went to the bathroom together,

1080
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:55,509
without telling me.

1081
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,131
-I'm so angry.
-What...

1082
00:47:57,593 --> 00:47:59,040
What's so bad about
going to the bathroom together?

1083
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,099
-Don't you see how serious this is?
-Is it that serious?

1084
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:04,735
Look at this. I knew it.

1085
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:06,636
GDU. NTYA.

1086
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:07,346
What?

1087
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:09,590
GDU is grown-ups don't understand.

1088
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,717
NTYA is I'm not talking to you anymore.

1089
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,516
I'm going to run away.

1090
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:15,926
-Don't stop me!
-I'm sorry.

1091
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:17,982
Make me a turtle ship.

1092
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:21,410
Just a second.
Your sister is running away right now.

1093
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:23,226
Let go of me!

1094
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:25,436
-Make me a turtle ship!
-Let go of me!

1095
00:48:25,524 --> 00:48:27,849
-I'm running away!
-You shouldn't run away like this!

1096
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:32,176
Who would have thought
he'd start counting sheep?

1097
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:35,324
If I doze off again,
I might really get fired.

1098
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:36,597
This time,

1099
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,513
I have to stay awake.

1100
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:39,536
No matter what.

1101
00:48:40,204 --> 00:48:42,230
Let's continue with interview.

1102
00:48:42,312 --> 00:48:43,279
Ready...

1103
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:44,242
Cue.

1104
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:49,113
So you have a total of 95 sheep.

1105
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:52,794
Your sheep have especially shiny fur
and look very healthy.

1106
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:54,650
Is there a secret to that??

1107
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:57,272
The secret?

1108
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:02,648
I do have...

1109
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,749
...a secret.

1110
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:05,686
Really?

1111
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:07,027
What is that?

1112
00:49:15,147 --> 00:49:19,096
What? The secret is
playing harp to his sheep?

1113
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:26,012
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1114
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:29,754
The sound of the harp is making
me sleepier and sleepier.

1115
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:32,113
All right.

1116
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:33,624
I have no choice.

1117
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:14,690
I don't seem to age at all.

1118
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,050
What are you doing right now?

1119
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:30,159
Why are you here in that condition?

1120
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:32,574
I smelled the ramyun.

1121
00:50:32,836 --> 00:50:34,222
I want some too.

1122
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:36,030
What?

1123
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:45,524
You still think of ramyun
even in that condition?

1124
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:47,765
I can't believe you.

1125
00:50:49,433 --> 00:50:50,684
Be frank with me.

1126
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:52,292
Are you just pretending to be injured?

1127
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:54,626
-No.
-Forget it.

1128
00:50:55,158 --> 00:50:56,800
I'll go back to reading my script.

1129
00:50:57,957 --> 00:50:59,269
What should I do?

1130
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:01,030
Jungi should never see that note.

1131
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,005
Jungi!

1132
00:51:02,094 --> 00:51:02,889
Hold on.

1133
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:04,010
What is it now?

1134
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:07,158
What's your opinion on
reducing the screen quotas?

1135
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,337
What?

1136
00:51:09,337 --> 00:51:10,519
Why are you asking me?

1137
00:51:10,607 --> 00:51:13,179
We work in the movie industry.
We should all think about it.

1138
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:14,122
Don't you agree?

1139
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:15,290
Have a seat.

1140
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:16,241
Hurry up.

1141
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:18,995
This is ridiculous. I can't believe her.

1142
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:24,946
Tell me. What are your thoughts?

1143
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,134
Well...

1144
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,950
Screen quotas are necessary to
protect the Korean movie industry.

1145
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:36,986
Why am I living with a man
who won't even let me buy a car?

1146
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:40,375
Then why don't you go back
to your first love?

1147
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:43,077
You shouldn't run away.

1148
00:51:43,377 --> 00:51:45,669
Your parents will be so worried.

1149
00:51:46,714 --> 00:51:47,596
Uncle,

1150
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:50,589
can you put sharp spikes
on top of the turtle ship?

1151
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:51,959
Hurry up!

1152
00:51:52,047 --> 00:51:54,759
I get it. I'm already
making the spikes now.

1153
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:56,234
I'm home.

1154
00:51:56,442 --> 00:51:57,481
Who's that boy?

1155
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,099
There's another kid?

1156
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:00,044
What's going on?

1157
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:01,834
Sujin, who's that guy?

1158
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:02,900
He's a CD.

1159
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:04,881
So he's car dealer?

1160
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:06,636
What is he doing here?

1161
00:52:06,725 --> 00:52:08,525
-MWBC. (Mom wants to buy a car)
-MRWBC? (Mom really wants to buy a car?)

1162
00:52:08,614 --> 00:52:09,864
MDF. (Mom and Dad are fighting)

1163
00:52:09,953 --> 00:52:11,309
-TFA? (They're fighting again?)
-What are they talking about?

1164
00:52:11,397 --> 00:52:14,042
I need to talk to Mom and Dad
about my university applications.

1165
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,679
Whatever, I don't care about university.

1166
00:52:15,772 --> 00:52:17,213
I'll just give up.

1167
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:19,823
Hey, stop!

1168
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:22,070
Why would you give up
on going to university?

1169
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:23,797
You should go, if you
have the opportunity.

1170
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,582
Talk to me.

1171
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:27,245
Which university are you interested in?

1172
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,469
This is the university I'm interested in.

1173
00:52:31,558 --> 00:52:34,058
But my grades are just above three.
It won't be easy.

1174
00:52:34,147 --> 00:52:35,576
I see.

1175
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:38,569
The thing is, I've always loved webtoons.

1176
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:40,208
I'd love to go to an art school.

1177
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:42,279
But I guess it's too late now.

1178
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,651
What should I do?

1179
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:46,167
Well...

1180
00:52:46,682 --> 00:52:49,088
I think you should choose
what you really want to do.

1181
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:51,420
I'm asking you because
I'm not sure what it is.

1182
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:53,202
Can't you be more serious?

1183
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,410
Sorry.

1184
00:52:54,877 --> 00:52:57,409
What am I doing here?

1185
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:01,454
By the way, is she going
to sign the contract or not?

1186
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:05,004
Guys, just a second.

1187
00:53:13,868 --> 00:53:14,840
Ma'am.

1188
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:15,918
Fine,

1189
00:53:16,007 --> 00:53:18,270
I'll give up on that car.

1190
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:20,714
I'm so disappointed in you.

1191
00:53:24,308 --> 00:53:26,382
Why are you crying?

1192
00:53:30,403 --> 00:53:31,555
Actually,

1193
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:33,611
I'm worried about you.

1194
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:37,105
What if you get in an
accident while driving?

1195
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:39,649
You know I can't live without you.

1196
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:42,911
Why would you say that?
That was what this is all about?

1197
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:45,570
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1198
00:53:45,658 --> 00:53:47,749
-Honey.
-Mijung.

1199
00:53:54,508 --> 00:53:55,567
What was that?

1200
00:53:55,656 --> 00:53:57,210
-Gosh.
-What's wrong?

1201
00:53:57,363 --> 00:53:59,057
What happened to M and D?

1202
00:53:59,885 --> 00:54:01,603
Guys, KDNTK.

1203
00:54:01,692 --> 00:54:02,936
Just GTB!

1204
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:05,289
-GTB!
-What's KDNTK and GTB?

1205
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:07,443
KDNTK. Kids don't need to know.

1206
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:09,761
GTB. Go to bed!

1207
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:10,936
GTB. GTB!

1208
00:54:11,025 --> 00:54:12,729
-What about my turtle ship?
-I have to run away from home!

1209
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:13,966
-My admission counseling!
-Shush...

1210
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:14,912
-GTB.
-My turtle ship!

1211
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,139
-GTB!
-My admission counseling!

1212
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:18,870
-Come on!
-GTB!

1213
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:23,158
That was hectic.

1214
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:27,207
I see why they have so many kids.

1215
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:29,108
That was out on nowhere.

1216
00:54:34,328 --> 00:54:36,808
How was it?

1217
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:40,963
Did you enjoy...

1218
00:54:41,204 --> 00:54:43,776
...your food?

1219
00:54:43,865 --> 00:54:44,812
Yes.

1220
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:46,856
It was really good.

1221
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,764
No wonder they're married.
They talk the same way.

1222
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:54,443
I'm so sleepy.

1223
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:57,875
How did you two meet?

1224
00:54:57,964 --> 00:54:59,368
I went...

1225
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:04,993
...to her concert...

1226
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:09,928
...and saw her performance.

1227
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:12,129
It was love...

1228
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:15,689
...at first sight.

1229
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:21,545
What did she sing?

1230
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,732
Should I...

1231
00:55:24,627 --> 00:55:31,109
...sing it for you?

1232
00:55:31,198 --> 00:55:32,578
Now?

1233
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:41,177
What is this?

1234
00:55:41,515 --> 00:55:42,801
Is this a lullaby?

1235
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:45,275
Why did it have to be this song?

1236
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:53,809
I'm sleepy.

1237
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:55,828
I'm so sleepy.

1238
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,912
It's driving me crazy.

1239
00:55:58,727 --> 00:55:59,870
What do I do?

1240
00:56:49,162 --> 00:56:50,564
Today, we have looked into the life...

1241
00:56:50,653 --> 00:56:53,225
...of the world renowned
conductor, Park Chulhong.

1242
00:56:53,314 --> 00:56:55,559
We hope they live happily ever after.

1243
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:57,729
This has been Han Suyeon
of Report Special Force.

1244
00:56:57,817 --> 00:56:59,499
Cut! Okay.

1245
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:01,270
We will wrap up here.

1246
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:02,838
Good job.

1247
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:03,719
Good job.

1248
00:57:03,808 --> 00:57:04,740
Good job.

1249
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,869
How does it feel to have
finished your first shoot?

1250
00:57:07,205 --> 00:57:09,606
I'm sorry for making so many mistakes.

1251
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:13,792
Now that it's done, I feel on cloud nine.

1252
00:57:13,881 --> 00:57:15,190
-Really?
-Yes!

1253
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:18,323
I feel like I could fly.

1254
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:19,511
Want to see?

1255
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:33,816
What's happening?

1256
00:57:34,936 --> 00:57:36,995
Am I really flying?

1257
00:57:42,385 --> 00:57:43,417
No way.

1258
00:58:06,481 --> 00:58:08,796
Of course, it would be great
if we could do huge projects,

1259
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,584
like Marvel Cinematic Universe
to take action against Hollywood,

1260
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:13,484
but considering the film market in Korea,

1261
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:15,883
the profits won't be as... Wait.

1262
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,624
Why am I telling all these to you?

1263
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:21,154
Why? It's such a constructive
and useful opinion.

1264
00:58:21,242 --> 00:58:22,542
Whatever!

1265
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,805
I'm tired.

1266
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:25,084
I'm going to bed.

1267
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,378
What do I do? I can't just let him go.

1268
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:30,734
Jungi! Wait!

1269
00:58:30,822 --> 00:58:32,685
What is it this time? What? What?

1270
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:36,228
Can you grab that stuffed animal for me?

1271
00:58:36,392 --> 00:58:38,641
I can't sleep without it.

1272
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:40,674
That doesn't even suit you.

1273
00:58:40,762 --> 00:58:42,021
All right.

1274
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:55,006
Oh gosh! What happened?

1275
00:58:55,483 --> 00:58:57,119
What are you doing?
Why did you touch my butt?

1276
00:58:57,512 --> 00:58:58,781
It's just...

1277
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,724
Um...

1278
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,668
I know my butt looks good, but still.

1279
00:59:03,455 --> 00:59:04,522
What's that in your hand?

1280
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:05,530
What?

1281
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:08,786
Hey.

1282
00:59:09,806 --> 00:59:10,740
Hey, what...

1283
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:11,927
What do you think you're doing?

1284
00:59:12,868 --> 00:59:14,315
Why did you eat it?

1285
00:59:14,403 --> 00:59:15,836
Hey, hey!

1286
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:17,815
Hey, give it!

1287
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:18,789
What is this?

1288
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:20,915
No, don't! Don't look at it.

1289
00:59:21,003 --> 00:59:22,616
-No, don't!
-Leave me alone! What is it?

1290
00:59:32,893 --> 00:59:33,972
Kim Jeongeun.

1291
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:37,260
How could you...

1292
00:59:38,317 --> 00:59:39,844
Listen. It's...

1293
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:41,688
The thing is...

1294
00:59:42,661 --> 00:59:43,974
"Lee Jungi, crazy fool"?

1295
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,766
What? What are you talking about?

1296
00:59:45,932 --> 00:59:48,102
Is swearing out loud not enough for you?

1297
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:51,241
Did you have to write it out on paper...

1298
00:59:51,773 --> 00:59:55,615
...and stick it on my butt?!

1299
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,731
What do you mean, swear?

1300
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,625
Whatever, you mean witch.

1301
01:00:00,702 --> 01:00:02,402
What is he talking about?

1302
01:00:06,643 --> 01:00:07,734
"Lee Jungi, crazy fool"

1303
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:09,437
What's this?

1304
01:00:11,793 --> 01:00:14,105
What? Jeongeun cursed at you?

1305
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,528
That's what I'm saying!

1306
01:00:15,617 --> 01:00:18,197
She wrote on paper,
"Lee Jungi, crazy fool" and so on,

1307
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:19,987
and stuck it on my butt!

1308
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,720
That why...

1309
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,285
...you should stop bothering her.

1310
01:00:23,374 --> 01:00:25,644
How annoyed must she have gotten?

1311
01:00:27,273 --> 01:00:28,204
Do you think so?

1312
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,901
Why aren't the rest coming?
It's getting late.

1313
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,671
"Sheep Farm"

1314
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,623
What?

1315
01:00:54,712 --> 01:00:56,509
You fell asleep during the interview?

1316
01:00:57,425 --> 01:00:58,958
I told you already.

1317
01:00:59,233 --> 01:01:00,907
But even the producer...

1318
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:03,032
...and the staff all fell asleep.

1319
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,991
So I didn't get in that much trouble.

1320
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:06,530
That's good to hear.

1321
01:01:07,483 --> 01:01:09,395
Anyways, thanks for picking me up.

1322
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:11,125
No problem.

1323
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,693
I already told you,
I was right around the corner.

1324
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:16,227
I'm still thankful nonetheless.

1325
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:19,734
I was wondering how I would
get home at this hour.

1326
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:21,219
You saved me.

1327
01:01:22,065 --> 01:01:24,568
I'll buy you some food
at the rest stop on the way home.

1328
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:26,333
What do you want to eat, Wooshik?

1329
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,363
Wooshik?

1330
01:01:33,015 --> 01:01:34,329
He fell asleep.

1331
01:01:44,698 --> 01:01:45,538
Wooshik.

1332
01:01:45,627 --> 01:01:46,747
You have a phone call.

1333
01:01:49,192 --> 01:01:50,117
Wooshik?

1334
01:01:56,283 --> 01:01:57,394
Hello?

1335
01:01:58,773 --> 01:02:00,431
Yes, this is Wooshik's phone.

1336
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:03,695
He can't answer the phone right now.

1337
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:04,984
What is it about?

1338
01:02:05,072 --> 01:02:07,844
Wooshik left his clothes
at the event hall.

1339
01:02:08,003 --> 01:02:11,185
I left it with the information desk
at the lobby of Gangnam Wedding Hall.

1340
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:12,365
Please pass that message to him.

1341
01:02:12,454 --> 01:02:13,848
Oh, all right...

1342
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,003
Wait.

1343
01:02:16,497 --> 01:02:18,404
Did you say Gangnam Wedding Hall?

1344
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:20,900
Was the event held in Gangnam?

1345
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:21,846
Yes.

1346
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:23,374
Why do you ask?

1347
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:27,179
It's nothing.

1348
01:02:27,855 --> 01:02:29,625
I'll let him know.

1349
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:31,185
Thank you.

1350
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,437
He said he was right around the corner.

1351
01:03:43,355 --> 01:03:45,771
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1352
01:03:46,202 --> 01:03:47,915
I was chosen to play
in "Challenge! King of Quiz".

1353
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:49,784
-What?
-The prize is 40 million won?

1354
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:51,998
-Why did it have to be this fool?
-Pass!

1355
01:03:52,087 --> 01:03:53,725
Kook Kibong, who passed all the questions,

1356
01:03:53,814 --> 01:03:55,025
is the final contestant!

1357
01:03:55,113 --> 01:03:56,254
Let's go!

1358
01:03:56,342 --> 01:03:57,495
Don't forget to take this, Jungi.

1359
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:58,964
How long has it been since
I last got a present?

1360
01:03:59,052 --> 01:04:00,605
What if I become a star?

1361
01:04:00,694 --> 01:04:01,409
What happened?

1362
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:03,707
Don't you know kids all over
the country watch our show?

1363
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:06,234
The first guy cuffed himself.

1364
01:04:06,323 --> 01:04:07,705
Shouldn't we throw
a welcome party for Suyeon?

1365
01:04:07,793 --> 01:04:10,375
The main writer called me,
so I should get going.

1366
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:12,504
Suyeon, you're quite drunk.

1367
01:04:12,592 --> 01:04:13,739
Your pronunciation is bad.

1368
01:04:13,828 --> 01:04:15,315
You can't even spell,

1369
01:04:15,403 --> 01:04:17,045
and you don't have good drinking manners.

1370
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:19,614
Is there anything that
you can do properly?

1371
01:04:19,702 --> 01:04:22,399
Enough, you jerk!
