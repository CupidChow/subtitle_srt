1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:02,803
Why?

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,705
Did you do anything crazy?

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,307
When I was drunk, I...

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,098
...confessed to Suyeon about my feelings.

5
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:10,275
You confessed?

6
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,003
What happened after that?
What did Suyeon say?

7
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:15,297
I don't know. I can't remember
what happen after that.

8
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:17,184
Jungi, what should I do?

9
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:31,899
Hey, Wooshik...

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,802
Yesterday...

11
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,954
Suyeon, the thing is...

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,440
How did we get back?

13
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:42,142
What?

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,644
I can't remember anything.

15
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,665
What? You can't remember anything?

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,758
-From when?
-Well...

17
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:51,351
I can't remember anything from after
we left the chicken feet restaurant.

18
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:54,655
Did I make any mistake?

19
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,657
No, you didn't. Not one single mistake.

20
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,158
What a relieve!

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,161
I was worried if I made any mistake.

22
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:04,164
I better wash up and pull myself together.

23
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:09,970
That's a relief.

24
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,840
How long are you going to keep this up?

25
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,936
Aren't you going to
confess to Suyeon at all?

26
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,225
Well...

27
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:19,947
I don't have the courage yet.

28
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,249
I will just...

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,929
...do it next time.

30
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,858
Please start up. Please! Please!

31
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:34,461
Rebecca, why are you doing this to me?

32
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:38,699
Kibong, why are you home so early?

33
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,435
I came back to pick up something.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,436
Really?

35
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:44,404
What do you think?

36
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:49,042
You invested in this truck for me, so
I've been cleaning it since this morning.

37
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:51,244
It has become so clean, right?

38
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,312
That's right...

39
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:53,647
What's going on?

40
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,350
-Why do you look so down?
-You see...

41
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,953
My manager said he'll fire me
if I can't sell a car by this week.

42
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,456
-And I couldn't sell any yet.
-Really?

43
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,558
What do we do?

44
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,661
Is there anyone who would buy one?

45
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,364
Rebecca, what's wrong with you today?

46
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,766
Are you upset with me about anything?

47
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:14,365
What are you doing?

48
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:17,571
Rebecca won't start.

49
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,172
Maybe it's broken?

50
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,100
No! My Rebecca is strong!

51
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,176
Yeah, right.

52
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,179
The door opens by itself and
doesn't run properly at all.

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,600
That's right.
Jungi, instead of being like this,

54
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:30,283
what about changing the car?

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,085
What are you saying?!

56
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,387
She will hear you!

57
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,689
Don't you know that she
stays mad for a long time?

58
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:37,491
How can a car hear you?

59
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,292
Don't you even feel sorry for Rebecca?

60
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,294
It's been more than 20 years!

61
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:42,896
I bet she wants to rest too.

62
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,699
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

63
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,901
While we're on the topic,

64
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,805
there's a nice model that just came out.

65
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,607
Here, have a look at it.

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,884
Oh my gosh! Rebecca, you're back!

67
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,885
What the? It started on its own?

68
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:07,387
See! I told you that Rebecca is strong.

69
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,989
Then, you're not going to change your car?

70
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,291
Why would I when she's fine?

71
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,895
In the far future,

72
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:19,266
if my Rebecca dies,
I'll make sure to look for you. Okay?

73
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:22,569
Rebecca, you're back!

74
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,371
My Rebecca is back!

75
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,475
Brother, be gentle.

76
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,778
So, why did you wash it for the whole day?
You should have do it moderately.

77
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:35,682
Kibong invested his last salary
in it for me. How could I do that?

78
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:41,254
I'll work really hard, and pay back this
deed to Kibong. I'll make sure of it!

79
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,557
I guess you're all grown up now?

80
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,460
-So, is all the preparation going well?
-Of course.

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,064
But I need a business permit,
and still have a lot of things to do.

82
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,966
I'm back.

83
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,468
Suyeon, you're...

84
00:03:57,073 --> 00:04:00,075
-Who is this?
-A new producer for our show.

85
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:02,075
I see. Nice to meet you.

86
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,478
-Why are you here?
-Well...

87
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,980
We were filming and Suyeon got injured.

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,081
Injured? Where?

89
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,084
I hurt my ears while filming
at the shooting range.

90
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:12,986
Ear? Don't you have to
go to the hospital then?

91
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:16,590
Just some tinnitus but I'm fine
now, so don't worry.

92
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:18,689
Thank you for giving me a ride.

93
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:22,205
It's nothing. But are you sure
you can do shooting tomorrow?

94
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,297
We can just use other reporter tomorrow.

95
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,600
It's okay. I can do it. I really can.

96
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,437
Okay, then. Take care of your health then.

97
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:31,104
I'll pick you up at home
tomorrow, so see you then.

98
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,406
-Okay.
-Okay. Then, goodbye.

99
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:35,108
Goodbye.

100
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,078
-I'll get some rest then.
-Okay.

101
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,781
Give it to me. I'll carry them.

102
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,982
I can carry them.

103
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,383
It's okay, just go to your room.

104
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,285
Thank you, Wooshik.

105
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:57,404
But, will you really be okay
for the shooting tomorrow?

106
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,299
-You should rest for a few days.
-I can't.

107
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,067
I barely manage to get a regular spot,

108
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:04,104
if I rest a few days,
someone else might take that spot.

109
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,329
-And I'm really fine, so don't worry.
-Okay, then.

110
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:09,943
-Have some rest then.
-I will.

111
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:17,108
Brother, brother.
Come and see me for a bit.

112
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,119
Why? What's wrong?

113
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:21,521
I have a bad feeling about this.

114
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:24,400
-About what?
-The producer or whatever he was.

115
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,193
Not only did he send her back,

116
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,428
the way he looks at
Suyeon is suspicious too.

117
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,217
I'm sure he has feelings for Suyeon.

118
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:34,620
No way. It's possible
for colleague to do that.

119
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:38,029
Hey, colleagues are the dangerous one.

120
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:39,326
They work together for the whole day,

121
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,130
they eat together,
have dinner parties together,

122
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:44,824
and soon, colleagues will
become "darling" and "honey".

123
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:46,646
-That's how things go.
-Really?

124
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:49,549
So, hurry up and confess to her.

125
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,953
Brother, don't you know that
love is all about timing?

126
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,555
Confess? Forget it.

127
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:02,529
Hey, Wooshik.

128
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,730
What's wrong?

129
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,334
I was wondering if you're
getting enough rest.

130
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,289
-What are you doing?
-I can't sleep,

131
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:13,473
-so I'm revising tomorrow's script.
-I see.

132
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:18,411
By the way, the producer just now...

133
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:19,813
How is he?

134
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:20,914
Producer?

135
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:25,485
He's kind and friendly.

136
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,823
And because he's good-looking,
he's quite famous with the female staff.

137
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,424
I see.

138
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,326
Why do you ask about him?

139
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,023
What?

140
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,128
Oh, it's nothing.

141
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:39,532
By the way, Suyeon, actually...

142
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,534
...I have something to tell you.

143
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:42,636
Something to say?

144
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,104
What is it?

145
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:44,938
What?

146
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,741
You see...

147
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,442
I...

148
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,936
I...

149
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:54,714
What are you trying to say?

150
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:55,915
Tell me.

151
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,317
Yes, okay.

152
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,619
Suyeon...

153
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,621
Suyeon, you know...

154
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,425
Actually I like...

155
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:11,731
Suyeon! What's wrong?

156
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,011
I can't hear.

157
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,219
-I can't hear anything.
-What?

158
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,804
What do you mean by that?

159
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,806
All of a sudden? Why?

160
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,278
Stop it.

161
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,000
Why have you been sighing so much?

162
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,416
I'll be fired if I can't
sell one car by this week.

163
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,825
And I couldn't see anything again today.

164
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,718
Really?

165
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:34,521
That's a big problem. What to do?

166
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:37,490
It's so suffocating.
I need some air.

167
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,858
Oh my!

168
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,262
-What's wrong with it?
-It's nothing.

169
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,765
I don't know what's wrong,
but she keeps getting the wrong buttons.

170
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,568
What a total mess.

171
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:51,159
Then, what do I press to open the window?

172
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,473
To open the window, you need to press
this. Actually, I don't know either.

173
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,876
-What?
-Yes, that's why it's best not to open it.

174
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:59,179
Many people have been victims
of the window.

175
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,981
Then, turn on the air conditioner.

176
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:04,351
What's this? Why did the radio switch
on when I turn on the air conditioner?

177
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,196
It's fine.

178
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,167
It will be less boring listening
to the radio on the way.

179
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,989
My goodness.

180
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:13,093
What do I need to press to turn
on the air conditioner then?

181
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:15,695
-Gosh!
-I can't see!

182
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,389
What the heck is this now?

183
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:18,798
I can't see!

184
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:20,800
I can't see! I can't see!

185
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,171
My goodness.

186
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,574
Oh my gosh!

187
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,676
What's wrong?

188
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,578
Is Rebecca's condition very bad?

189
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,280
There's not one single
place of it that's fine.

190
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,583
Do you really drive this car?

191
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:40,086
Yes. It was fine before the accident.

192
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:43,223
Really? But looking at it's condition...

193
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,425
...I don't think you can use it anymore.

194
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,527
You should scrap it.

195
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,030
What? What do you mean by that?

196
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:53,433
What are you saying right now?

197
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,935
This won't do! Get me another mechanic!

198
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,738
Bring me a skilled mechanics! Come out!

199
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,640
What is all this fuss about?

200
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:12,652
Why are you making a fuss
at a sacred repair shop?

201
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,354
What's going on?

202
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:19,059
This person keeps on asking
me to fix a worn out car.

203
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:21,450
But who are you?

204
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,063
How are you doing?

205
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:27,434
I am the Master of Car
Repair, Manager Jang Junhyeok.

206
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,730
He is the best mechanic at our repair shop.

207
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:31,838
Really?

208
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,442
Sir, please save my Rebecca.

209
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:38,342
First, let me check it's condition.

210
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,145
Yes, sir.

211
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,119
There's no single part
that is still well-functioning.

212
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,924
On top of that, there's serious
contamination going on everywhere.

213
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,627
Just what did you do for
it to be in this state?

214
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,430
I thought they're just simple breakdown.

215
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:01,734
Sir, does that mean you
can't save my Rebecca?

216
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,138
I've never said such words,

217
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,641
and there's nothing
impossible for Jang Junhyeok.

218
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,544
For this repair,

219
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,447
I'll handle it myself.

220
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:17,117
Thank you, sir.

221
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:18,751
Thank you very much, sir.

222
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:39,572
Okay.

223
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,774
I will start the repairing process.

224
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,658
-Screw wrench!
-Screw wrench.

225
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:52,447
-Screwdriver!
-Screwdriver.

226
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:57,824
-Pliers!
-Pliers.

227
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,019
Get your head straight!

228
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,628
I apologize.

229
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,233
Darn it!

230
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,043
What are you doing? I can't see! Suction!

231
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:11,938
-Rebecca is crying!
-Suction!

232
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,741
Manager, there's a problem!

233
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,043
Various oil level are falling rapidly.

234
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,345
Stop fussing and hurry
insert five liter engine oil...

235
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,641
...and 10 liter of transmission fluid.

236
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,439
manager, the battery is dead as well.

237
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,750
Darn it!

238
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,251
Firstly, let's revive the battery.

239
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,220
-Get me the jumper cables!
-Yes, sir.

240
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:29,222
Stand back.

241
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,724
Go!

242
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,127
Rebecca! My Rebecca!

243
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,128
Go!

244
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,931
Rebecca!

245
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:39,899
Go!

246
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,502
Switch it to the maximum!

247
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:44,204
-Go!
-Rebecca!

248
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,505
Rebecca!

249
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,708
Shoot!

250
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,200
Is Suyeon okay? What did the doctor say?

251
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:58,269
Her eardrum is a bit damaged,
so she won't be able to hear for a while.

252
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,772
But it's only temporary.
After some medication and rest,

253
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,380
she will get better.

254
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:04,357
That's a relief then.

255
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,492
Suyeon, go and get some rest.

256
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,194
What did you say?

257
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,063
Go and rest!

258
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,064
What?

259
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,066
Suyeon, you should go and rest.

260
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,204
Too bad that happens to her ears.

261
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,600
That's right! So, did you confess?

262
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,708
I didn't.

263
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:25,000
The moment I was about to confess,
her ears couldn't hear anymore.

264
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,112
My goodness.

265
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:28,014
How can you be so unlucky?

266
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,316
I don't know too.
Why does it have to be right then?

267
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:31,806
Hello.

268
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,281
Oh, it's you.

269
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:39,057
What brings you here?

270
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,562
I got a message from Suyeon that
she has some problem with her ears.

271
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,580
I came by because I was worried.

272
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,789
Is Suyeon doing fine?

273
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:47,490
She just came back from the
hospital and is resting.

274
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:49,469
Really? She's in her room, right?

275
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,558
Can I see her for a moment?

276
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:55,074
The doctor said that she needs total rest.

277
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,076
So, I'm afraid you can't see her.

278
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,244
Is it?

279
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,346
I'll come back tomorrow then.

280
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:02,615
Please help give the porridge to her.

281
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,911
Yes, sure.

282
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:06,335
Okay, then. Goodbye.

283
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:08,421
Goodbye.

284
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,329
See. Look at that.

285
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,026
Look at how he rushed here after
hearing that Suyeon is sick.

286
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:17,048
-What if he ends up confessing before you?
-What do you want me to do then?

287
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,398
How can I confess when she can't hear?

288
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,599
Why can't you?

289
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:22,159
She can see, so you can always text her.

290
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,870
Who confesses through text?

291
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,889
I guess it's a bad idea.

292
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,741
You've seen the movie "Love,
Actually" before, right?

293
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:32,445
A man confessed to a woman
using a sketchbook there.

294
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:33,843
It was very romantic.

295
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,248
Just forget it.

296
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:37,350
What sketchbook nonsense
are you talking about?

297
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,527
"Suyeon, I have something to tell you"

298
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:55,910
"Suyeon, I have something to tell you"

299
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,906
Why won't it open?

300
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,307
Are they stuck?

301
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:04,310
Wait a minute.

302
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:20,860
Suyeon!

303
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:22,829
Suyeon!

304
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,631
Suyeon, are you okay?

305
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,635
What did the doctor say?

306
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:31,871
Her cornea got slightly damaged.

307
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:34,841
If she uses eye drops for a few
days and rests well, she'll be fine.

308
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,542
I see.

309
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,145
Suyeon!

310
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,247
Go in and rest.

311
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:44,851
She can't hear, nor can she see see.

312
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,853
Jeongeun, take her to her room.

313
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:47,769
Yes, sure.

314
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:51,080
Who is that? Who are you?

315
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:53,559
-It's okay. It's fine.
-It's me. Me.

316
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,461
-Me.
-Jeongeun?

317
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:01,000
I can't believe such things happened.

318
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,770
If you confess by words,
she couldn't hear.

319
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,872
When you confess by
writings, her eyes get hurt.

320
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,374
Maybe you're not meant to ask her out.

321
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,575
Shut up.

322
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,269
Are you going to give up?

323
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,399
You want me to confess again?

324
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,848
How can I do that to someone
who can't hear or see?

325
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:19,152
You can do it through touch.

326
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,357
-Just like this.
-Are you crazy?

327
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:23,256
Who confesses by writing
on someone's palm?

328
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,758
Fine. Forget it. Don't do it.

329
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:28,060
When Suyeon gets stolen by the producer,

330
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,850
don't come crying to me. I won't care.

331
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,590
Just don't blame me. Do you understand?

332
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,166
Forget it!

333
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,789
I'm not someone who's
crazy about confessing!

334
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:36,169
I won't do it! I won't!

335
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:43,273
Suyeon...

336
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,368
No! No! This is just wrong!

337
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:19,364
It's done! It's done!

338
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,249
Sir, are you done with the repairing?

339
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,684
What will happen to Rebecca now?

340
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:26,285
We experienced some difficulties,

341
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,387
but the repair was successful.

342
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,980
Try to start your car.

343
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,492
Yes, sir.

344
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:47,406
Sir, it won't start?

345
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:48,899
I see.

346
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:49,603
What?

347
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,414
I thought it would work.

348
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,713
This was impossible from the beginning.

349
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:54,714
What are you saying?

350
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,621
What are you saying?

351
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,779
I thought you're the most
skillful master here?

352
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,189
A mechanic is a mechanic, we're not God.

353
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:08,761
As you can see, even with modern
technologies, this car can't be saved.

354
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,663
You should give it up now.

355
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,564
What?

356
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:13,966
Give up?

357
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,136
Give up?

358
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,539
That's impossible.

359
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:21,733
No!

360
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:23,736
That's impossible.

361
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,078
No, this is not happening.

362
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,569
Jungi, calm down.

363
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:31,083
There's nothing that you can do.

364
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,867
Let's let Rebecca go. Okay?

365
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,354
I am still...

366
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,058
...not ready to let Rebecca go.

367
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:43,283
Accept the truth.

368
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:45,464
Do you think that will
bring Rebecca back to life?

369
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,366
My goodness!

370
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,670
By the way Jungi,

371
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:52,772
do you remember when you promised me...

372
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,472
...that you'll buy a car
from me if Rebecca is broken?

373
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,147
Do you want to look at
the catalogue first?

374
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,349
Here you go.

375
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:18,464
Rebecca, you're back? Is that you?

376
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:22,335
Kibong, you heard it too, right?
Rebecca made a sound!

377
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:23,836
No, I didn't hear anything.

378
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,738
You must have heard it wrong.

379
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,565
Did I?

380
00:18:28,952 --> 00:18:29,775
Here.

381
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,128
Oh my Gosh, Rebecca! Is that you?

382
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,745
Rebecca, you came back to life?

383
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,021
-That's impossible!
-It's a miracle!

384
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,609
Rebecca, you totally had me!

385
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,092
Don't joke around like that!

386
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,995
Rebecca.

387
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,498
Rebecca, let's be together forever!

388
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:03,976
To celebrate Rebecca coming back to life,
should we make ramyeon?

389
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,378
With plenty of egg and ham.

390
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,400
Forget it! I have no appetite,
so just eat all you want!

391
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:10,483
Just say no, why are you being all crabby?

392
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,086
Rebecca, have a good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

393
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,693
This is driving me crazy.

394
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:24,296
I only have two days left,
how can I sell any car?

395
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,819
Is Rebecca immortal or what?

396
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:29,802
Why does she keep reviving?

397
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,972
Wait!

398
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,890
That's right.

399
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:48,688
If I take out the spark
plug, it won't revive again.

400
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,496
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

401
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,199
I'm doing everything for you.

402
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,016
It is hard for you too.

403
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:05,004
So, you can't resent me for it.

404
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,172
Okay?

405
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:20,619
What's going on? Who's making that noise?

406
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:24,924
What's that?

407
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:29,720
What's this?

408
00:20:29,804 --> 00:20:32,331
It's me. Rebecca!

409
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,501
Rebecca?

410
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,890
Why are you here?

411
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:40,105
Jungi treasures me so much.

412
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,000
Why did you do that to me? Why?

413
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,211
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:48,296
But it's hard for you too.

415
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,082
I did them all for you, so...

416
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,917
Lies! They're all lies!

417
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,910
It wasn't for me, but for yourself!

418
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:57,010
You need to do this to
be able to sell car.

419
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:00,192
Only then, you won't get fired.
Isn't that right?

420
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:01,694
But...

421
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,696
I won't ever forgive you!

422
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,899
I will destroy you!

423
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:11,704
Give me back my spark plug.

424
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,807
Give me back my spark plug.

425
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:19,912
Give me back my spark plug!

426
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:28,387
Why? What's wrong?

427
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,791
No. It's nothing.

428
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:34,226
Okay.

429
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,841
Here you go.

430
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:55,014
Ta-da! Guys, try them.

431
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,917
What's this?
Why does spaghetti look like this?

432
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,118
Yuri, what's this?

433
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:02,087
The new menu that I will be selling
at Yuri's Kitchen Food Truck.

434
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:03,589
This is "Cherry Jubileegetti",

435
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,691
and this is "Gone With
the Wind Spaghetti".

436
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,193
What do you think?
It sounds delicious, right?

437
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:10,896
-Hurry and try it.
-Okay, sure.

438
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:21,200
Wow! The appearance looks weird,

439
00:22:21,284 --> 00:22:24,009
-but it's really delicious!
-I know, right?

440
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,504
That's it! I knew my skill is still great!

441
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,218
Where's Suyeon?

442
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,819
She said she don't feel like eating.

443
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,410
She's busy watching
something on her laptop.

444
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,616
What was she watching?

445
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,625
Wait a minute.

446
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,527
Does that mean her eyes are okay now?

447
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:44,029
-Yes, she can see well now.
-Really?

448
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,664
Okay, good!

449
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,466
Hey, brother. Brother!

450
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,668
How could you go in the
middle of food sampling?

451
00:22:52,365 --> 00:22:55,474
Then Kibong,
can you do the sampling instead?

452
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,276
Yuri, I'm sorry...

453
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,269
...but I don't have any appetite at all.

454
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:01,067
What?

455
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,882
You don't have an appetite?

456
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:05,684
-You've never been like that before?
-Well...

457
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,988
I had nightmares all
night and couldn't sleep.

458
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:11,750
Rebecca!

459
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:13,350
What the? What's that sound?

460
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:14,950
Isn't that Jungi's voice?

461
00:23:15,034 --> 00:23:17,062
What's wrong with him?
Is something wrong?

462
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:19,965
Hey!

463
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,467
What's wrong?

464
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,168
Something is weird about Rebecca.

465
00:23:23,562 --> 00:23:25,771
I was still able to start it yesterday,

466
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,673
but today it won't start.

467
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,537
This won't do.

468
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:32,044
I better call Manager Jang
Junhyeok from Master Car Repair.

469
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:48,827
Hey...

470
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,362
Suyeon...

471
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,602
-Suyeon.
-That startled me!

472
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:01,307
Wooshik, what is it?

473
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:05,577
Suyeon, lower your voice. Your voice.

474
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,105
What?

475
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:11,183
Oh, my voice is too loud?

476
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,685
Okay.

477
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,688
Is it okay now?

478
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,510
No, it's still loud.

479
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:19,792
Too loud.

480
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,894
Lower it down a bit.

481
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,619
Is this much okay?

482
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:27,900
Yes, good! That's perfect.

483
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,203
By the way, what are you watching?

484
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,221
I'm checking other program.

485
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,708
I got a message from
the producer just now.

486
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:38,917
He said he'd replace me with
someone else until I get better.

487
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,715
I'm worried she might take my
spot so I want to try anything.

488
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:46,018
I can't understand a single
thing because of my ear.

489
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,420
By the way, what is it?

490
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,456
Do you have anything to ask me?

491
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:53,726
What?

492
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,327
No, it's nothing.

493
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,830
Finish what you were doing. Finish it.

494
00:24:58,334 --> 00:24:58,931
Okay.

495
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:11,410
Just what am I doing?

496
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,445
She's already going through a hard time.

497
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:17,649
Can I help her with anything?

498
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,755
Rebecca...

499
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:35,100
This is your favorite fuel additive.

500
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:39,930
I brought your favorite fuel additive.

501
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:44,710
Why can't you take in any of this? Why?

502
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,114
Jungi, calm down.

503
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:52,818
Although Rebecca is gone,
the living needs to keep on living.

504
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:55,621
I know.

505
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,257
I know that too.

506
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,795
I just can't believe that...

507
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,497
... I won't be able to see Rebecca again.

508
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,200
Rebecca...

509
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,805
We've gone through a lot together.

510
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:15,036
Right?

511
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,766
But what's with the car?

512
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,973
I'll be shooting drama soon.

513
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:20,779
So I bought myself a car.

514
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:23,068
Rebecca...

515
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,085
Good job.

516
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,404
One for Rebecca, one for me.

517
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:53,512
I guess I'm in love with you.

518
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:57,116
Rebecca! Why?

519
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:04,823
Jungi, those who meet must part one day.

520
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,292
And those who part will meet someone new.

521
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,895
While on the topic,

522
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:15,000
I've picked a very good car for you.

523
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,770
Do you want to take a look?

524
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:21,464
Hold on.

525
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,476
I want to say my last goodbye...

526
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,179
...to Rebecca.

527
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,780
Okay.

528
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:35,587
You've gone through a hard time
meeting a bad owner like me.

529
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,086
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,492
In the next life,

531
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:43,795
meet a better owner,

532
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,498
who'll do plenty of tuning,

533
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,202
and get feed premium gasoline.

534
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,187
You need to be happy!

535
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,595
Then...

536
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,781
Rebecca...

537
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,816
Is that you?

538
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,086
Rebecca, is that you?

539
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,292
Rebecca!

540
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,594
Kibong!

541
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:17,763
Rebecca came back to life!

542
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:19,965
Rebecca came back to life!

543
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,168
That's impossible? How can that happen?

544
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,872
I clearly pulled out the sparks plug.
How can this happen?

545
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,950
Rebecca, are you really alive? Really?

546
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:35,614
Rebecca is answering me!

547
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:36,815
Rebecca!

548
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,921
Rebecca is answering me!

549
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,007
Rebecca! Rebecca!

550
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,193
-Rebecca!
-That's impossible.

551
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,695
That's impossible!

552
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,607
Why did he sleep here?

553
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,577
Brother, wake up. Wake up!

554
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,876
Why? What's wrong?

555
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:10,983
I fell asleep.

556
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,786
By the way, what have you
been doing since last night?

557
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:17,990
I just have something to do.

558
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:22,375
-By the way, where's Suyeon?
-Suyeon?

559
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,596
She left just now to go to
the broadcasting station.

560
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,999
She went to the station while being sick?

561
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,801
She said she's fine now,
and that she can hear well now.

562
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:30,902
Already?

563
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,605
That's impossible.

564
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,577
Why did she go to shoot when she's sick?

565
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:41,680
Wait, that is...

566
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,881
Suyeon!

567
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,386
-Hey Suyeon!
-Wooshik?

568
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,388
-Why are you here?
-What?

569
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:50,589
I just want to...

570
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,180
But are you really fine?
Can you really do the shoot?

571
00:29:53,284 --> 00:29:55,420
Yes, I'm all better now.
My ear is fine too.

572
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:58,897
Then, let's check at the hospital
to see if you're really fine.

573
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,920
No need to do that, I'm really fine.

574
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:04,002
And I've already told the producer that
I'll do the shoot, so I'm in a rush.

575
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:05,203
I'll be back.

576
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,013
Suyeon!

577
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,623
Suyeon, are you okay?

578
00:30:24,734 --> 00:30:26,725
Suyeon! Suyeon!

579
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,298
I'm fine.

580
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,401
You're not fine at all!

581
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,403
Why are you being so stubborn?

582
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:39,304
I'm sorry.

583
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:42,500
Whatever. You won't be able to do the
shoot today, so let's go to the hospital.

584
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,409
I need to go to the shoot!

585
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:46,311
Or else, someone would take over my spot!

586
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:48,814
But still! How are you supposed
to shoot when you're sick?

587
00:30:48,984 --> 00:30:50,615
Please stop being stubborn!

588
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,517
Let go of me!

589
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,519
I said I'm fine!

590
00:30:54,623 --> 00:30:56,609
I told you I'm fine,
so why are you acting like this?

591
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,924
-Who are you to act like this?
-Because I like you!

592
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,728
That's why you're always
on my mind and I'm worried!

593
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,431
What did you say?

594
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,635
What do you mean by that?

595
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:17,242
It's alive!

596
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,544
What's wrong with him?

597
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,646
I don't know.
He's been like that since just now.

598
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,249
Did he see a ghost or what?

599
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,453
What the? What's up with you now?

600
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,455
Jungi, I...

601
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:33,458
I did it. I did it...

602
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,360
Did it? Did what?

603
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,663
I confessed to Suyeon.

604
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:39,890
Really?

605
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:42,367
You confessed to Suyeon? What do you mean?

606
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,339
What the heck?

607
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,655
Wooshik, you like Suyeon?

608
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,238
Never mind about that!

609
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:48,940
So, what did Suyeon say? What happened?

610
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,443
I don't know.
I was too shocked, so I ran away.

611
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:54,913
What? You ran away after confessing?

612
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,616
My mind goes blank and I
didn't even realize it.

613
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,918
What do I do now?

614
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,724
Suyeon, you're home?

615
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:10,429
Wooshik...

616
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:13,131
Can we talk for a bit?

617
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,232
What?

618
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,234
Sure...

619
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,983
I'm sorry for being stubborn just now.

620
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:36,988
I think I was being uselessly stubborn
because I'm nervous about my job.

621
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,809
It's nothing.

622
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,494
Maybe because it's the first time
I found something I want to do,

623
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,229
so I want more of it.

624
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,165
That's possible.

625
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:49,668
Wooshik, you know...

626
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,571
...I really enjoy my job,

627
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:54,099
and it's very precious to me.

628
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:59,077
So I want to work hard and be successful.

629
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:00,679
Of course, you should!

630
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:02,481
That's why...

631
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,353
I don't think I can date anyone yet.

632
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,258
You understand what I mean, right?

633
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:15,760
What?

634
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,362
Yes.

635
00:33:22,274 --> 00:33:24,671
But still, we're good friends, right?

636
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,470
What?

637
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,472
Of course.

638
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,274
We're friends.

639
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:32,177
Are you really okay?

640
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,678
Yes, I am!

641
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:37,282
Suyeon, don't worry about me.
I'm really okay.

642
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,685
Then, I'll leave first.

643
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:42,687
Okay.

644
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,200
Brother, what did Suyeon say?

645
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,003
I was rejected.

646
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,806
Really?

647
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,910
Brother, will you be okay?

648
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,312
It can't be helped.

649
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:09,314
That's how she feels.

650
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,917
I'm okay.

651
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:13,485
I'm really okay.

652
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:24,195
Hey, you look good. Where are you going?

653
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,231
I have a gig at a live cafe.

654
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,432
I'll be back later.

655
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:28,624
Wait. Wait a minute.

656
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,029
Are you going like this?

657
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:32,938
You said I look good? Why? It's strange?

658
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,510
Gosh, look at myself.

659
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:43,700
I'll get going then.

660
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,116
Hey! Wooshik!

661
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,799
Not the guitar.

662
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:50,622
You brat!

663
00:34:51,997 --> 00:34:55,301
You're not wearing any pants!

664
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:56,595
What?

665
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,832
I see.

666
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,913
What is wrong with me?

667
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,405
My goodness.

668
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,707
Poor Wooshik.

669
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:11,343
I'll be back after my gig.

670
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:12,830
You're going for a gig?

671
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,939
You should just rest today.
Your heart won't be at ease anyway.

672
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,040
No. I'm totally fine.

673
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:19,317
I'll get going then.

674
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,299
Hey Wooshik.

675
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,426
-You have a gig?
-Yes.

676
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:31,529
What about you?

677
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,431
I want to buy something.

678
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,333
Should we leave together?

679
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:38,236
I'm late for my gig, so I'll go first.

680
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,302
What are we going to
do with the awkwardness?

681
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,199
Things will get much worse, right?

682
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:54,519
Exactly.

683
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,822
-Is my brother really okay?
-How can he?!

684
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,810
He almost left without his pants.

685
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:03,228
He swung on his guitar with
just his underpants on.

686
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,930
Of course he won't be okay.

687
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,333
My brother likes Suyeon so much.

688
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,435
That's right. I'm worried.

689
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:15,440
What if you guys take
Wooshik out on a trip?

690
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:17,931
Should we?
It's my day off tomorrow anyway.

691
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:19,811
I can't because I have
a shooting tomorrow.

692
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,906
"Here we go, Nice Man!"

693
00:36:21,994 --> 00:36:24,115
Really? I can just go with him then.

694
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:25,097
You?

695
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:27,910
I can't seem to trust you.

696
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:30,510
You're looking down on me.

697
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:31,950
Don't worry!

698
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,904
I will surely cheer him up!

699
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:37,328
Just trust me! Okay?

700
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:44,287
The weather is really nice.

701
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:46,104
Sure, yes.

702
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:50,299
We came all the way here, relax a bit.

703
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:53,806
Let's have fun today,
and forget all the bad things. Okay?

704
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:54,585
Okay.

705
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:56,981
Let's set our tent then.

706
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,884
Just stay still.

707
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:01,352
I'll set them up.

708
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,388
Oh my.

709
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:05,890
Hello?

710
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,392
Yes, sir.

711
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,594
What?

712
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,997
Yes, I understood.

713
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,669
What's wrong? What call was that?

714
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,270
I just got fired.

715
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:21,773
He said I don't have to come to work.

716
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:22,874
Really?

717
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:24,476
It makes sense.

718
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:27,078
I only sold one car this month.

719
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,280
I would fire myself too if I was him.

720
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:35,286
It wasn't easy getting in.

721
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:41,159
I don't think you're in
the mood for camping.

722
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,961
Should we just go back?

723
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,030
What are you saying?
We're here to cheer you up!

724
00:37:46,243 --> 00:37:49,334
Don't mind me.
Let's just set up the tent first.

725
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:03,982
It's all set.

726
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,387
Kibong, the tent is all set up.

727
00:38:09,494 --> 00:38:11,089
Really?

728
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,490
Good job.

729
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,792
It's nothing.

730
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,909
But will you really be okay?

731
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,495
Do you want to rest in the tent?

732
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:20,419
What are you talking about?
We're here to cheer you up!

733
00:38:20,503 --> 00:38:21,792
We can't do that.

734
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:25,470
I'll make a delicious kimchi
stew, so wait a minute.

735
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,472
Where was the gas stove again?

736
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,973
Here it is.

737
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,185
What's wrong?

738
00:38:40,494 --> 00:38:41,410
What is it now?

739
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:43,488
I thought it was the gas stove.

740
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,991
It's the toolbox.

741
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,227
It looks exactly like the gas stove.

742
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,096
I'm so useless.

743
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,199
Hey, it's fine.

744
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:58,002
We can just make the stew
by using the campfire.

745
00:38:58,144 --> 00:38:59,504
-Really?
-Yes.

746
00:38:59,644 --> 00:39:01,239
Let me take out the kimchi first then.

747
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:02,106
Okay.

748
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,315
What is it now?

749
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:12,617
Why? What's wrong?

750
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,021
It's the gochujang.

751
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:19,691
I thought it was kimchi
because it was red.

752
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,694
I'm so useless.

753
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,020
It's fine.

754
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:27,032
At outdoor, it's delicious even if we
only eat rice and gochujang.

755
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,800
-Does it?
-Yes, it's fine.

756
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,902
Then, I'll make the rice right now.

757
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,204
Where did I put the rice?

758
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,011
What's wrong now?

759
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,116
It's coarse salt!

760
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,118
I thought it was rice
because it was white.

761
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,051
That is so like me.

762
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:53,202
I'm so useless.

763
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:59,297
I don't know if Kibong is
doing well with everything.

764
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:01,733
I'm so worried.

765
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:02,967
I feel the same.

766
00:40:03,744 --> 00:40:05,959
Jeongpal, have you memorized
the script for the show?

767
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:07,839
Don't worry, I've memorized them.

768
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,270
What's going on? Jeongeun, you're going
to be on the show with Jungi?

769
00:40:11,354 --> 00:40:13,965
As Miss Dumpling, Nice's Man assistant.

770
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,046
Miss Dumpling?

771
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,770
I introduced her to the director,

772
00:40:16,854 --> 00:40:19,984
and he said that she looks like Miss
Dumpling and was accepted right away.

773
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:22,269
You know how she looks
exactly like a dumpling.

774
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,789
Do you have the dumpling face?

775
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,293
Hey, I told you to stop
calling me dumping!

776
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:32,196
You hit the wrong spot!

777
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:34,265
You hit the wrong spot!

778
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,234
Jungi, are you okay?

779
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,249
Does it hurt?

780
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:40,238
My back. Check my back.

781
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,145
Back? Where?

782
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:43,541
-Here?
-Yes.

783
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,517
You got tricked again!

784
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,719
No matter how many times I tricked you,
you'd still fall for the same trick.

785
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:57,956
Lee Jungi, you're dead today!

786
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,649
Please save me!
A dumpling is hitting a person!

787
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:06,064
You mean violent dumpling!

788
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,134
You deserved to be hit.

789
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,438
But how can you make such a joke to a woman?

790
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:15,039
Wait, stop. What?

791
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,736
What do you mean woman?

792
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,043
Are there any other
woman here besides you?

793
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,612
What? Are you done?

794
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,585
Gosh, she's getting all sulky again.

795
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,427
Why do you do that?

796
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,390
Can't you go a day without getting beaten?

797
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,994
Yes. Teasing Jeongeun is the most
entertaining thing in the world.

798
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,831
Sure. Fine.

799
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:42,100
You don't see me as a woman, right?

800
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,375
Lee Jungi!

801
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,378
Ta-da! How do I look?

802
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,614
Still ugly!

803
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,615
Darn it!

804
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,018
Not that.

805
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:02,387
I haven't worn dress in a long
time, so how do I look?

806
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:04,222
I see. A dress?

807
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,424
You look like an ugly person in a dress.

808
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,526
I put on some earrings too.

809
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,228
Wow, the earrings!

810
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,196
You look like an ugly person
wearing dress and earrings.

811
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,800
I also put extra care in my makeup.

812
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,103
You look like an ugly person who puts extra
care on makeup who wears dress and earrings.

813
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,406
What? I should just...!

814
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:26,010
No, I should hold it in. Hold it in!

815
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:28,899
Why are you not hitting me?
Just finish it!

816
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:30,391
Why should I hit you?

817
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,183
You're just joking anyway.

818
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,775
I'm not joking.

819
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,088
I am more serious than I have ever been.

820
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,094
-Why are you wearing dress anyway?
-For no reason.

821
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:46,697
-I want to dress up and live modestly.
-Gross.

822
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,702
-By the way, what's this?
-This is a magic...

823
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,306
Do you want to see some magic trick?

824
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,594
Really? Sure, why not.

825
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,810
I'll show you a magic trick.

826
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:02,313
It's a magic where this
coin gets inside the bottle.

827
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,706
See. It doesn't get in, right?

828
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,216
Now it will goes in.

829
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,210
Okay watch.

830
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,789
Abracadabra!

831
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,760
-It doesn't work?
-Oh, that's right!

832
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:18,162
I forgot I need some oil from the nose.

833
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:22,066
Okay, some oil from the nose.

834
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,969
No, let's just take all. Oil from
the nose, the cheek, the forehead,

835
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,772
Oil from here and there.

836
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,373
Okay, let's do this.

837
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,777
Okay, abra... I don't want to do
it anymore. I don't feel good.

838
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,278
What the heck?

839
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,081
-I'll go and read some script then.
-Okay, go.

840
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,353
She got tricked again.

841
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:44,655
What a fool!

842
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,952
What is this?

843
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,477
Lee Jungi, you brat!

844
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:57,268
What a prankster.

845
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,371
I should go cleanse my face.

846
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,676
What the? What's wrong with her?

847
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,578
Is she sick anywhere?

848
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,682
Hey Jungi. Jungi.

849
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,284
Yes Yuri, why?

850
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:17,588
The male guests keep on looking at me.

851
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,790
They do recognize beauty.

852
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,094
Really? Of course they do.

853
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,396
Your face is extraordinary.

854
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,832
You're embarrassing me.

855
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,802
Oh, right. When you succeed with that
magic trick, you have to show me.

856
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,304
Of course.

857
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,406
I should go prepare for my shoot.

858
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:37,008
Nice.

859
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,410
What's up with him all of a sudden?

860
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,112
Do I look good today?

861
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:44,515
My goodness. It's hard being so pretty.

862
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,853
Gosh, I'm hungry.

863
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,626
Kibong, cheer up.

864
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,528
I want to do that too,

865
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,131
but I don't have the energy to do that.

866
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:00,998
Really?

867
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:04,001
Why don't we head back now?

868
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:06,103
What? Where do you think you're going?

869
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,117
We're here to cheer you up!

870
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:12,210
Okay, let's forget everything
and play some board game.

871
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,812
I brought some board
game to play with you.

872
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:19,217
Let's see.

873
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:21,219
I heard it's the most famous game.

874
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,021
-Hey, do you know this game?
-Of course.

875
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,424
I played with it a lot when I was young.

876
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,325
Then, can you tell me how to play?

877
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,815
-I never played it before.
-It's simple.

878
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,029
Just throw the dice and move
how much the dice shows.

879
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,865
And if you stop on my
land, you need to pay.

880
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,661
I need to pay? Why?

881
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:39,036
Since you stop on my land,

882
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,371
you need to pay something like a toll.

883
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,440
I see. Toll.

884
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,775
Then, what is this?

885
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:46,077
That's the building.

886
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,047
You can build houses, office
buildings, and hotels on your land.

887
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,383
-The most expensive is building, then...
-Wait!

888
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:54,252
But why is the hotel
the most expensive one?

889
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,554
-Won't building be more expensive?
-What?

890
00:45:57,029 --> 00:46:01,659
That's the usual case in reality but
the rule for the game is like this.

891
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,864
Why must you stop for three rounds
if you land on a deserted island?

892
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:07,965
What's the reason?

893
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:10,255
Why would there be a reason?

894
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,270
It's just the rule. The rule!

895
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,471
Then, what if I buy the deserted island?

896
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:16,766
How many times do I need to tell you
that you can't buy a deserted island?

897
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:17,866
Why can't I buy it?

898
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,077
-It's a land as well.
-How would I know?

899
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,366
I told you it's the rule!

900
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,936
It's been there since the game came out!

901
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:26,450
So frustrating! Forget it!

902
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,246
Why are you angry?

903
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,288
Do you think it's possible
for me not to be angry?

904
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:33,391
Just the rules have taken us an hour
and you still can't understand anything!

905
00:46:33,506 --> 00:46:35,593
You're driving me crazy!

906
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:38,296
I'm sorry. I'm always like this.

907
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,364
I brought the tool box
and not the gas stove.

908
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,768
I can't even understand the game rules.

909
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,468
No wonder I got fired.

910
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,747
It's all erased now.

911
00:46:56,937 --> 00:47:00,451
I'll teach Jungi a
lesson once I caught him.

912
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,953
How dare he draw on my face?

913
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,757
So embarrassing! Gosh!

914
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,360
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

915
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,847
-Have you eaten?
-I don't feel like it.

916
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,564
I'll go in and rest.

917
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,566
Suyeon, wait a minute.

918
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,468
Why?

919
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,070
Well...

920
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,472
I heard about it.

921
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,375
That you rejected Wooshik's feelings?

922
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,576
What?

923
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,680
Yes.

924
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:31,382
Why?

925
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,585
Is Wooshik not that great?

926
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,989
He might not be competent,
but he's really nice.

927
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,461
I know it too. I know he's nice and kind.

928
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:47,064
But I can't date anyone right now.

929
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,867
I just started my job,

930
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,969
and I also have that problem with my dad.

931
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,372
You know it too.

932
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,976
I guess that's true.

933
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,307
I understand, Suyeon.

934
00:48:01,406 --> 00:48:03,280
Don't care about what I said. Okay?

935
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,984
Okay. I'll get inside first then.

936
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,890
I can understand how Suyeon feels like,

937
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,093
but I feel sorry for my brother.

938
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,662
What can we do?

939
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:21,982
My goodness.

940
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,267
My goodness.

941
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,142
Kibong, I've said sorry just now.

942
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,643
Please cheer up.

943
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,345
No.

944
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:38,315
It's all my fault for being stupid.

945
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,891
I don't think we're up for some games.
Let's go back.

946
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,186
What are you saying?

947
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,995
We're here to cheer you up.
Where do you think you're going?

948
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,697
Then, let's just drink some beer.

949
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:54,899
Beer?

950
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,600
Here you go.

951
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:01,584
Let's have a drink, cheer up,
and have a lot of fun. Okay? Nice!

952
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,074
Okay. Cheers!

953
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,176
Cheers!

954
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:34,371
It's only fun drinking
with a lot of people.

955
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,775
What? Are you saying you
want to join those girls?

956
00:49:39,149 --> 00:49:40,544
It's okay.

957
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,747
Who would play with an unemployed guy?

958
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,551
But I still want to drink beer.

959
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,554
But drinking with just
the two of us is boring.

960
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,827
Okay, fine. I'll try and talk to them.

961
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,930
So, just stop sighing.

962
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,131
Damn it!

963
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:03,534
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

964
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,396
This is my friend and he was
just rejected a few days ago.

965
00:50:08,502 --> 00:50:12,309
So, I bring him out to cheer him up.

966
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,812
I see. You're such a good friend.

967
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,414
No, I'm not.

968
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,618
It's something normal between friends.

969
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,896
But don't you feel bored
just drinking like this?

970
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:26,190
Let's play some games.

971
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,315
Let's play an image game.

972
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,516
Nice. I know that game too!

973
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,085
I'll start first then.

974
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,397
So, everyone hold a chopstick.

975
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,326
Wooshik, here. Hold it up.

976
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:38,997
Pick the guy you think
could be the kindest here.

977
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:40,804
One, two, three!

978
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,173
What's this? Me?

979
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,576
Do I look kind?

980
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,579
You have a very kind face.

981
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,382
Anyway, since you got
caught, hurry and drink.

982
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:52,583
Sure, why not.

983
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,487
Wooshik is kind too.

984
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:06,196
Now it's my turn, right?

985
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,000
The one who looks funniest here.

986
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,609
One, two, three!

987
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,706
What? It's me again?

988
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,508
My gosh!

989
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:20,010
Wooshik is fun too.

990
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:21,812
I'll drink it then.

991
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,714
Since I'm a fun guy.

992
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,822
It's my turn now, right?

993
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,824
What should I ask?

994
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:38,016
Who among us is closest
to your ideal type?

995
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,056
Why do you ask such a question?

996
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,532
Why? It's fun.

997
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:45,336
Okay, then. One, two, three.

998
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,219
I'm tired, so I'll rest first.

999
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,522
Kibong, what's wrong with you?
Kibong! Kibong!

1000
00:52:08,129 --> 00:52:09,627
Why is he suddenly acting like that?

1001
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,635
Vroom...Vroom... Nice Man!

1002
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:19,236
It's the Nice Man!

1003
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,826
No, no.

1004
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,607
Nice kids should not eat junk food.

1005
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,222
Don't do it, don't!

1006
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,510
Why?

1007
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:28,078
For that...

1008
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:31,281
Miss Dumpling will come
out and explain to you.

1009
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:32,774
Should we call her together?

1010
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:35,619
Miss Dumpling!

1011
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,022
Cutie Cutie Dumpling!

1012
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:43,045
Dayoung, junk food includes many
ingredients that are harmful to our body.

1013
00:52:43,129 --> 00:52:45,429
If you eat them, you'll get stomachache,

1014
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,631
and suffer from diseases.

1015
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:50,634
-I see.
-So everyone,

1016
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,636
you shouldn't eat junk food either.

1017
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,338
Okay, Nice Man.

1018
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,141
Then, goodbye!

1019
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,277
-Vroom...Vroom... Nice man!
-Cutie Cutie Dumpling!

1020
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:02,546
Cut! Nice!

1021
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,552
Good job everyone.

1022
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,550
-Good job.
-Good job.

1023
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,553
Jungi, how did I do? Was it good?

1024
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,455
You did really well.

1025
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:15,359
But you look really cute
wearing the costume like this.

1026
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,261
What are you saying?

1027
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,463
It's because you're cute.

1028
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,664
Come here.

1029
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,866
Such a cutie!

1030
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,769
Cute! So cute!

1031
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,706
Cute! Cute! So cute!

1032
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,107
So cute!

1033
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,277
What the heck? Lee Jungi!

1034
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,806
Hey, I can't see! I can't see a thing!

1035
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,314
She fell for it again!

1036
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,136
-What a fool!
-I can't see!

1037
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,218
She fell for it again!

1038
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,120
Jeongeun!

1039
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,321
Hey!

1040
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,423
Jeongpal, I'm sorry!

1041
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,326
Jeongpal, I went overboard with my jokes.

1042
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,028
Forget it!

1043
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,332
Jeongpal! Are you okay?

1044
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,735
Did you sprain your ankle?

1045
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:02,339
Gosh, you even hurt your heel.

1046
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,142
Why do you wear something
you don't usually wear?

1047
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,926
I just feel like it, so what?

1048
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,746
What? I can't wear heels?

1049
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,714
Why are you mad?

1050
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,984
Just stand up first. Can you stand up?

1051
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,923
This won't do.

1052
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,726
Come over here. Hop on my back.

1053
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,716
What? Forget it!

1054
00:54:26,002 --> 00:54:27,898
How do you expect to walk like that?

1055
00:54:28,009 --> 00:54:29,233
Just hop on.

1056
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,704
Hurry up!

1057
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:35,606
I told you I'm fine.

1058
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,441
My gosh! So heavy!

1059
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,110
Is this gravity pulling me or what?

1060
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:42,913
You're as heavy as a rock!

1061
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:44,698
What is your weight anyway?

1062
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,785
Don't you know it's rude to
ask those things to women?

1063
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,386
I'm repeating this again.

1064
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,856
-There's no woman here.
-I'm a woman too!

1065
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:55,459
-Do you really not see me as a woman?
-Yes!

1066
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:56,960
Okay, fine.

1067
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,513
Then, let me ask you something.

1068
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:01,106
If we were trapped on a deserted island,

1069
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,500
what will you do if there's
only the two of us left?

1070
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:04,601
What?

1071
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,937
Your imagination is something.

1072
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,541
Then...

1073
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:13,239
I'll find myself a pretty sea turtle...

1074
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:17,147
...and have a boy turtle and girl turtle,

1075
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,049
and live happily ever after.

1076
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:20,951
What?

1077
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,521
Then, what if all the turtles are gone too,

1078
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,424
and there are only the two of us left.
What will you do then?

1079
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,320
What's that?

1080
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:31,028
Goodness.

1081
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,531
Then, the deserted island
will totally become deserted.

1082
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,133
What?

1083
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:39,138
Then, am I worse than turtle?

1084
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:41,226
Then, do you see me as a man?

1085
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,438
We both are just friends.

1086
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,442
Friends like Wooshik and Kibong.

1087
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,045
Why do you ask anyway?

1088
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:49,913
I just want to. Why?

1089
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:51,448
Hey, Jeongpal.

1090
00:55:51,743 --> 00:55:52,950
What is it now?

1091
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,251
You know...

1092
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,554
I'm really happy to have you as my friend.

1093
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:01,758
We can joke around,
practice acting together,

1094
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,360
and I can even rely on you when
I'm going through a hard time.

1095
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,462
So...

1096
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,232
Don't be angry even if
I joke around with you,

1097
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:10,394
always stay by my side...

1098
00:56:10,873 --> 00:56:11,965
...and be my friend.

1099
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:13,871
Okay, my friend?

1100
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,206
Sure.

1101
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:18,475
We're friends.

1102
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,377
Friends.

1103
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,548
Let's go have some ramyeon.

1104
00:56:36,965 --> 00:56:38,462
Please stop.

1105
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:40,163
It's nothing, so what's wrong?

1106
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:43,367
I'm sorry for making things
uncomfortable because of nothing.

1107
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,456
Well, I brought the tool box
instead of the gas stove,

1108
00:56:46,642 --> 00:56:48,572
I can't even understand the game rules,

1109
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,775
and I'm not even famous with girls.

1110
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:53,877
No wonder I get fired.

1111
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,380
You can just look for a new job.

1112
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,882
It's not as easy as you speak.

1113
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,818
That's right,
you won't understand how I feel.

1114
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,523
I wouldn't be like this if I was
merely dumped by a girl like you.

1115
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:08,025
-What?
-You were only rejected by a girl,

1116
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,215
and you made everyone worry
and made me come here with you.

1117
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:13,461
I said I didn't want to
come but you forced me to!

1118
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:16,056
So it's all my fault?

1119
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,635
I can finally see your true color.

1120
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,260
Well, I'm sorry for forcing
you to the camping site.

1121
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:23,173
All I wanted to do was to cheer you up!

1122
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,375
You don't even care about
it, you mean jerk!

1123
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,177
That's why you got rejected by Suyeon!

1124
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,579
What did you say? Are you done?!

1125
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,383
No, I'm not done yet! So what? I have so
many things to say but I'm holding it in!

1126
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,086
Forget it! Whatever! You frustrating jerk!

1127
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,688
That's why you got fired.

1128
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,389
What?

1129
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,391
This jerk!

1130
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:47,564
-Did you just hit me?
-Yes I did! So what? So what?

1131
00:57:47,669 --> 00:57:49,266
This jerk!

1132
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,968
Darn it!

1133
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,272
-My nose...
-Your nose...

1134
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,371
My nose is bleeding!

1135
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,375
You're dead today!

1136
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,277
Come here! Come over here!

1137
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,680
Come here!

1138
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,651
Come here!

1139
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:13,957
You darn jerk!

1140
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,461
You jerk!

1141
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:18,485
You dare hit me in the face?

1142
00:58:18,569 --> 00:58:20,456
You come over here!

1143
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,865
-Hey!
-Hey!

1144
00:58:28,544 --> 00:58:29,439
Hey!

1145
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:30,841
Wait, stop.

1146
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,043
-Let's rest for a bit.
-Okay.

1147
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:34,344
Okay.

1148
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,546
After this, you're dead.

1149
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:38,122
That's what I'm saying.

1150
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,951
If I tried harder, you won't
even be alive. Do you know that?

1151
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:45,155
-I haven't even used half of my strength.
-I haven't even used one fourth of it!

1152
00:58:48,246 --> 00:58:49,776
What's going on? Why are you laughing?

1153
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:51,466
It's just funny.

1154
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,563
What are we doing after coming so far?

1155
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,966
That's right.

1156
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,769
But still...

1157
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:00,771
I feel so much better...

1158
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:02,773
...after throwing some punches.

1159
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,076
It feels satisfying too.

1160
00:59:05,366 --> 00:59:06,076
Really?

1161
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,672
Do you feel better now?

1162
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:09,646
Better or not, what's there to it?

1163
00:59:09,762 --> 00:59:10,770
At least...

1164
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:12,867
...I've confessed this time.

1165
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,085
So I don't have any regrets.

1166
00:59:15,192 --> 00:59:16,219
That's right.

1167
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,813
Just forget it now.

1168
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,891
I can assure you.

1169
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:24,694
You'll meet a prettier and
nicer woman than Suyeon.

1170
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:27,497
Thank you.

1171
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:31,401
You'll also find a company
much better than that one.

1172
00:59:31,516 --> 00:59:32,836
Do you think so?

1173
00:59:41,553 --> 00:59:42,245
Well...

1174
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:43,547
Doesn't matter if you don't.

1175
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:44,948
Sure.

1176
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,350
A good day will come.

1177
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,058
The sky is really pretty.

1178
00:59:53,853 --> 00:59:54,958
Exactly.

1179
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:08,171
I told you I'm sorry.

1180
01:00:08,286 --> 01:00:10,876
How dare you smear my face...

1181
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:12,175
...and expect to live?

1182
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:14,177
How can you be so cold-hearted?

1183
01:00:14,286 --> 01:00:16,632
-Can't you just laugh it out as a joke?
-Shut up!

1184
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:18,115
Put both of your hands up!

1185
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,919
Good job!

1186
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:25,222
Don't rub it in!

1187
01:00:25,426 --> 01:00:27,538
And what is this look?

1188
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,526
I thought you said you'll start
dressing up from now on?

1189
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,685
I was going to, but I figure out to just live
how I want to.

1190
01:00:32,778 --> 01:00:34,865
Hey, put your hands up!

1191
01:00:35,377 --> 01:00:37,167
Are you going to do this to me
too? We're friends!

1192
01:00:37,276 --> 01:00:38,869
I'm like this because we're friends.

1193
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,270
Stick your arms near your ears!

1194
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:42,869
We're back.

1195
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,075
Welcome! Did you have fun?

1196
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,992
What happened to your face?

1197
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,378
Something happened.

1198
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,347
Are you feeling much better now?

1199
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,628
Yes, I feel much better,
all thanks to Kibong.

1200
01:00:52,756 --> 01:00:54,243
Oh right, I need to go out.

1201
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:56,052
Where are you going now?

1202
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,455
I got a call from the live cafe to
fill in for someone.

1203
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,657
Every penny counts.

1204
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:01,858
I'll get ready then.

1205
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:05,061
It seems like he feels much better.

1206
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:08,265
-What happened?
-I have my ways.

1207
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,268
I told you to trust me.

1208
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:13,470
That's amazing, Kibong.

1209
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:16,793
As a reward, do you want to see
a magic trick?

1210
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:18,375
Magic? Sure!

1211
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,676
What magic trick?

1212
01:01:37,248 --> 01:01:38,461
What are you doing here?

1213
01:01:40,037 --> 01:01:42,666
Wooshik, when did you get back?

1214
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,448
Just now. But why are you doing it alone?

1215
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,435
You can just call for help.

1216
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,904
-Let me help you.
-It's okay. I'll do it.

1217
01:01:47,977 --> 01:01:50,674
Friends should help each other out.

1218
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:52,576
-Don't you think so, my friend?
-What?

1219
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:54,277
Let's see.

1220
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,041
I just need to to take it to the rooftop,
right?

1221
01:01:56,616 --> 01:01:58,815
Okay, let's go.

1222
01:02:05,566 --> 01:02:06,990
I'm so hungry.

1223
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:11,561
I haven't eaten anything since
yesterday because of Kibong.

1224
01:02:16,077 --> 01:02:17,300
Maybe I should have some hotteok.

1225
01:02:20,676 --> 01:02:22,372
-Hello.
-Welcome.

1226
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:24,374
-One hotteok, please.
-Sure.

1227
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:30,180
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1228
01:02:31,257 --> 01:02:33,872
But why are you alone today?

1229
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:36,453
Where's the pretty girl that you
always come with?

1230
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,255
What? Well, just because.

1231
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,523
Why? Did you fight with your girlfriend?

1232
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:42,826
I told you she's not my girlfriend.

1233
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,928
We're just friends.

1234
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:46,863
A good friend.

1235
01:03:29,648 --> 01:03:33,262
I don't think I can date anyone yet.

1236
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:36,046
But still, we're good friends, right?

1237
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:40,317
You look so good together.

1238
01:03:40,426 --> 01:03:42,519
Try and ask her out.

1239
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:50,393
What's wrong?

1240
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:51,895
Are you alright?

1241
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,200
No.

1242
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,804
I thought I was okay.

1243
01:04:02,716 --> 01:04:04,307
But I guess I'm not okay.

1244
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,246
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1245
01:04:43,522 --> 01:04:44,833
I'm going to start composing again.

1246
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:46,516
I'll write a good song and
make a comeback.

1247
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:47,926
Are you sure Wooshik's heartbroken?

1248
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:50,013
He's been pretending to be fine,
but it was all a lie!

1249
01:04:50,117 --> 01:04:51,243
These words are all for Suyeon.

1250
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:54,313
He liked Suyeon since high school.

1251
01:04:54,397 --> 01:04:55,291
You're Jungi, right?

1252
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,693
-It's me!
-Who is he?

1253
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,822
I would've helped you out if I knew
you were an actor.

1254
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:00,023
This is driving me crazy.

1255
01:05:00,107 --> 01:05:03,566
I need to figure out his name in order
to get help from him.

1256
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:07,393
It's my first time with food trucks.
Do you have any tips?

1257
01:05:07,477 --> 01:05:08,493
It needs to taste good.

1258
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:09,770
You have to win them over with the taste.

1259
01:05:10,575 --> 01:05:12,090
I can't just stand here and watch.

1260
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,002
We need to come up with
shocking performance too.

1261
01:05:14,086 --> 01:05:16,773
I've only been receiving things
from Wooshik.

1262
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:18,982
What can I do for him?

1263
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:21,184
-Wooshik...
-Teacher!
