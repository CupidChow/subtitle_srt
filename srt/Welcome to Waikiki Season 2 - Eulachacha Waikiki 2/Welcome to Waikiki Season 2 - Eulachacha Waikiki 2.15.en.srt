1
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:07,918
Come closer.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,616
Yes, your majesty.

3
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:16,929
What did I...

4
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:20,956
-...say our relationship was?
-I am your man who is a friend.

5
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,452
In short form, a male
friend, your majesty.

6
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:24,829
Yes, I did.

7
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,337
But...

8
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:28,345
...I see you...

9
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:31,258
...as more than my male friend.
What should I do?

10
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:34,750
-Pardon?
-Gonggul.

11
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:37,751
Gonggul.

12
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,518
Stop, stop!

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,010
-What's wrong, sir?
-You really don't know?

14
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,024
Our play is about...

15
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:54,921
...fondly love that can never be
together between King and a clown.

16
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:58,722
I can't see any love in both of your eyes!

17
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,254
It's a bit weird.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,159
That is your problem.

19
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:05,373
How can you touch audiences' heart,

20
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,675
when actor like yourself
doesn't have a feeling.

21
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,166
This is fake acting, fake!

22
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:11,666
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,079
-Sorry, sir.
-This isn't working.

24
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,268
You should...

25
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,071
...stick together all day from now on.

26
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:19,385
No, you guys should live together.

27
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:20,667
Understood?

28
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:21,762
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:41,309
Wow, I'm getting good at it.

30
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:44,325
I'm back.

31
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,640
Hey, Jungi. I think my
sound of alphorn is... What?

32
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:49,728
Hello.

33
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:51,322
It's good to see you.

34
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,538
-What's up with the luggage?
-What?

35
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,132
Something happened.

36
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:59,168
I will explain to you later.

37
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:00,375
Sir,

38
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:02,962
-why don't we go to the room first?
-Sure.

39
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,574
By the way, Jungi.

40
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,059
-Does Jeongeun smoke?
-Pardon?

41
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,565
-Why does she have a pipe?
-It's not a pipe.

42
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,960
It's nothing...

43
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,261
Let's go.

44
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,457
Here we are.

45
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:23,674
Well...

46
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,063
You can unpack your things first.

47
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,175
Okay, sure.

48
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,360
Seunghyun.

49
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:33,163
-Do we really have to do this?
-Director...

50
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,670
...told us, we need to have
feelings for each other.

51
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,378
In order to act like real.

52
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,774
Let's do our best, and...

53
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,282
...make this play successful.

54
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:45,088
Understood, sir.

55
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,564
-Yes, why don't we give it a try?
-Okay, then I will...

56
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:51,879
-...get changed.
-Yes, make yourself at home.

57
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,665
-Hold on, Jungi.
-Yes?

58
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,247
Do lovers...

59
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,574
...leave the room,
because partner is getting changed?

60
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:02,977
Well...

61
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:07,174
-Then, I will just stay.
-Okay.

62
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:09,167
Sure.

63
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,707
Hello.

64
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:21,104
Hey Suyeon, we don't have a shoot today.
What brings you here?

65
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,095
-Producer said he has something to say.
-I see.

66
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,692
-What are you doing?
-I'm planning for new segment.

67
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:28,896
New segment?

68
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:32,999
I'm going crazy because I
can't think of anything.

69
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:34,376
Hair band...

70
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:36,893
Where did my hairband go?

71
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,482
It was right here just now.

72
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:39,392
What?

73
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:41,977
I'm always like this.

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,175
I bet, I have over 100 hair
bands that I lost in my room.

75
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:48,080
No matter how I search my
room, I can never find it.

76
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:51,181
Even socks. Later on,
there is only one sock that I can find.

77
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:53,975
I know right? It's not like
someone is stealing one sock only.

78
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:56,968
I'm so curious to know where they go.

79
00:03:58,563 --> 00:03:59,371
Right.

80
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,869
Ma'am, what about a segment like this?

81
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:04,972
-What segment?
-Like just now,

82
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:09,247
we find out things that might
be nothing but still curious.

83
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,746
We can experiment and
prove it scientifically.

84
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:13,845
-Is it too childish?
-No, no.

85
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,155
I like it. It sounds fun.

86
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:19,345
Suyeon, why don't we plan this in detail?

87
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:20,550
Really?

88
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,912
Then, I will help you too.

89
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:28,413
By the way, Jungi.

90
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,223
Do we really have to watch TV like this?

91
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,133
We have no choice...

92
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:33,925
...to create feelings for each other.

93
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,616
Well, I guess that's right.

94
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:39,924
Guys,

95
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,728
why are they being like
that since just now?

96
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,132
I heard, they are practicing their act.

97
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:47,439
They need to stick together until they
have feelings for each other or something.

98
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:50,409
Not anyone can act. Gee.

99
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:52,874
It's been a while since you came home.

100
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:55,064
Yes, I've been busy with recording lately.

101
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,969
I have no time to come home.

102
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:59,563
I need to get back after I get changed.

103
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:01,595
And you...

104
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:03,484
I told you to get some rest at home.
Why did you follow me to here?

105
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:05,785
I have no one at home. I'm bored.

106
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,472
Gosh, hey. Do you think this
place is a play ground for you?

107
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,488
That's why I bought pizza for you guys.

108
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:11,764
Forget it.

109
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,272
I will go take a shower.

110
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:14,272
Okay.

111
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:22,178
I have some question, Jeongeun.

112
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,558
-Is Wooshik seeing anyone?
-No, he isn't.

113
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:28,050
He never dated anyone. You didn't know?

114
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:29,947
He never did?

115
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:32,344
Why someone cool as Wooshik
hasn't dated anyone?

116
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:34,747
Actually,

117
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,618
he only liked one person,

118
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:38,944
who is his first love.

119
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,829
-It didn't go well anyway.
-Really?

120
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,847
Who is his first love?

121
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:46,933
I'm back.

122
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,132
Hey.

123
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,033
What is Jungi doing by the way?

124
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:54,145
It will only make you frustrated,
so just pretend you didn't see anything.

125
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:55,628
Hello.

126
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,629
Hello.

127
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,732
Suyeon, would you like some pizza?
Minah bought it for us.

128
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:04,152
No, it's alright. I have things to do.

129
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:07,144
-Have fun then, Minah.
-Okay.

130
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:10,947
What's wrong?

131
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,043
She really likes pizza.

132
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,265
-What's gotten into her?
-Jeongeun,

133
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,249
who is Wooshik's first love?

134
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:19,697
-You just saw her.
-Pardon?

135
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:23,284
Then, Suyeon is Wooshik's first love?

136
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:31,426
Does Minah think this is her house?
Why is she coming everyday?

137
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,125
Why do I keep bothering about Minah?

138
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,342
Gosh, forget it.

139
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,730
Let's just mind my
business about proposal.

140
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:51,335
Seunghyun,

141
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,534
shall we...

142
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,535
...go to bed now?

143
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,130
Shall we?

144
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,283
Good night.

145
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,485
By the way, Jungi.

146
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,738
If we were real lovers,

147
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,635
wouldn't we cuddle with each other?

148
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,730
-Then what should we do?
-Shall we...

149
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,341
...sleep with my arm around you?

150
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,230
-Your arm around me?
-I think...

151
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,643
...that will make us closer.

152
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,956
Well, then...

153
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,354
...why don't we give it a try?

154
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,613
Here.

155
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,062
Good night.

156
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,071
Yes, good night...

157
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,070
...to you too.

158
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:04,326
"Waikiki Guest House"

159
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,287
Why is it so complicated?
Am I doing it correctly?

160
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,743
-Good morning, Yuri.
-Good morning.

161
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,450
What are all these?

162
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:22,636
Oh, this?

163
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,437
Previous vanity and chair were
old, so I bought new ones.

164
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,024
I see.

165
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:30,221
-Why did you buy it in kit form?
-This is much cheaper.

166
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:33,143
I'm avoiding loss for food truck barely.

167
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:34,721
I should save money for these at least.

168
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:38,305
-My girlfriend is frugal.
-It's nothing.

169
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:40,300
But it's not easy...

170
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,403
-...to assemble.
-Really?

171
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,720
-Do you need my help?
-What?

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,977
-You?
-Yes.

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,286
-It's quite complicated to assemble.
-Gosh.

174
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:50,475
Yuri,

175
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:53,172
I might not be smart but I'm good at this.

176
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,256
I will assemble it quickly.

177
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,661
-So just trust me.
-Really?

178
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,644
Wow, my boyfriend is so cool.

179
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,456
It's nothing to be cool about.

180
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,464
30 minutes is enough to complete.

181
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,869
Wow, you are amazing.

182
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,485
Here is the instruction, Kibong.

183
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,295
Gee, leave it.

184
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,984
Why would I need instruction
for this easy job?

185
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,682
Okay, shall I start with it?

186
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:29,289
Gosh, this is so awkward.

187
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,996
How long do I need to do this?

188
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,505
Gee, this is so uncomfortable.
My neck is hurting like hell.

189
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:36,988
You scared me.

190
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,186
Seunghyun,

191
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:40,077
what's wrong?

192
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,275
-I got cramps on my neck.
-Pardon?

193
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,280
Jungi, let's stop now. It's too
uncomfortable. I can't do it no more.

194
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,676
Sure, sure.

195
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:50,202
I can't do it anymore too.

196
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,692
What do we need to do in order
to have feelings for each other?

197
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,493
Do you have any idea?

198
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:57,490
What about this, Seunghyun?

199
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:01,594
Why don't we talk about good things
or things we like about each other?

200
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,091
Then, we might able to find
some attractions of each other.

201
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,298
That's a good idea.

202
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:07,290
-I will start first then.
-Sure.

203
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:12,504
You have...

204
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,812
...a great voice.

205
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,504
It's cozy and makes me want to trust you.

206
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,496
Really?

207
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:20,296
Thanks.

208
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,313
-I will give it a go.
-Okay.

209
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:23,535
You have...

210
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,027
...an...

211
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,235
...attractive smile.

212
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:31,010
It makes me feel good,
even just staring at your smile.

213
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,621
-You think so?
-And...

214
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,324
...you have such pretty eyes.

215
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,332
Your eyes slant upward slightly,

216
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,316
and somehow they are sexy.

217
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,815
No, you are much sexier than me.

218
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,418
You worked out,

219
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:45,331
so you have a great chest.

220
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,988
And your lips!

221
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:49,194
You have sexy lips.

222
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,210
What do you mean sexy?

223
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,680
My lips are nothing compare to yours.

224
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,673
Your lips...

225
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,284
...call out for kiss.

226
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,760
Suyeon...

227
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:04,950
No, it's not...

228
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,451
I know what you're thinking,

229
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,459
but it's not what you think.

230
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,567
No, it's okay. Please continue.

231
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,368
I heard nothing. Nothing at all.

232
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,963
Suyeon, I said it's nothing! Suyeon!

233
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,569
Hey, Suyeon!

234
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:23,767
Okay.

235
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,879
I'm done with the chair.

236
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:27,549
Yuri,

237
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:28,467
what do you think?

238
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,546
It looks a bit weird.

239
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:33,553
Weird? What is?

240
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:38,875
The back of chair seems weird.

241
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,780
Look, it looks different
from the instruction.

242
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,609
Yes, it is.

243
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:47,911
But I don't think,
there will be an issue using it.

244
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:48,997
I guess?

245
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,202
It shakes so much.

246
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:55,375
It...

247
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,194
How great,
it will feel like a rocking chair.

248
00:11:58,694 --> 00:11:59,900
Isn't it okay as long as it doesn't break?

249
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,583
Still...

250
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:04,498
I bought it,
so I should assemble it properly.

251
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,404
Okay, got it. I will do it again.

252
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,776
Even though, I need to unscrew everything
and assemble it from beginning.

253
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,284
Well, it will be nice...

254
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,385
...to assemble properly.

255
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,482
Okay.

256
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,276
I can do it again.

257
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,172
Even though, it's tiring and hard.

258
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,044
I don't want to say this, but...

259
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:34,741
...you are bit picky.

260
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,655
-What?
-Nothing.

261
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:37,757
Forget it.

262
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:41,568
That's why I told you
to check the instruction.

263
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,829
I told you, I don't need it.

264
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:44,533
Why?

265
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,250
Are you worried that I will
do it incorrectly again?

266
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,750
-No it's not that...
-Aren't you busy?

267
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,536
Why are you still here since just now?

268
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,419
I’m sorry, but...

269
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,127
...can't you just leave?

270
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:56,420
I can't focus because you are around.

271
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:58,756
I feel like I'm taking a test.

272
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,350
Okay.

273
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,541
I will leave you alone.

274
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,915
Gee, what has gone wrong?

275
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,900
Why is it so wobbly?

276
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,900
I did it as what it says.

277
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:23,304
He's the one who told me he will do it.
What's wrong with him?

278
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,771
That jerk.

279
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,970
No...

280
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,875
I should let it go.

281
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,812
I shouldn't belittle my boyfriend.
Yes, I shouldn't.

282
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:42,619
Jungi,

283
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,731
my body feels heavy.

284
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:46,231
I will go to sauna for a while.

285
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,218
Sure.

286
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,096
-Have fun.
-Okay.

287
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:51,280
Wait, Seunghyun.

288
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:52,891
What's wrong?

289
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:54,291
Do you...

290
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:55,789
...want to go sauna together?

291
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,952
We can go sauna together
as we are both men.

292
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,746
We could help each other scrubbing
off dead skin, and play with water.

293
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:03,143
-That's how we can get closer.
-You are right.

294
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,829
-We can go together.
-Good, let's go together.

295
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,845
Let's go!

296
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:28,772
Gosh, it's more awkward than ever.
More awkward.

297
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:32,685
Why did I have to trip on soap and
fall on to his private part. Why?

298
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:34,149
This is crazy.

299
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,263
I can't stop thinking about it.

300
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,581
It's hard to face Jungi's face.

301
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,858
Seunghyun...

302
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,056
About what happened,

303
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,461
let's take it to our graves.

304
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,866
Yes, I'd want that too.

305
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,064
I'm thirsty.

306
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,470
Shall we drink something?

307
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:52,461
Sure.

308
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,286
I did it over again more than 20 times.

309
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:06,390
How come it looks different
every single time?

310
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,399
Does it even call this instruction?

311
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:12,176
How am I going to understand with
these simple diagrams?

312
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:16,293
What is furniture companies for,
if buyers need to assemble by themselves?

313
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,989
I should just get a wood in the
mountain and make it by myself.

314
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,982
They are trying to earn money easily.

315
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:26,185
This is insane.

316
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:28,463
What have I done wrong this time?

317
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:31,547
Kibong,

318
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:34,486
-have some drink.
-No thanks. I have no appetite.

319
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,583
Is it...

320
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,995
...not done yet?

321
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:39,486
Why?

322
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,988
Do you have an urgent matter?

323
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,275
Do you need to use it now?

324
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,685
-No, it's not...
-If not then, could you please wait?

325
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,868
I'm assembling my best for you.

326
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:52,781
How can she be so ungrateful?

327
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:53,971
Hey.

328
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:57,678
-If it's too hard, I will do it.
-Yuri.

329
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,547
It's not because it's too hard to make.

330
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:05,746
It's because you lack of consideration
and respect of your boyfriend.

331
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,351
-What did you say?
-Never mind.

332
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:10,446
Let's talk about this after
I'm done with assembling.

333
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:17,325
What have I done so wrong?

334
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:19,738
Gosh, it's nice.

335
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:26,333
Hey, that's how you drink yogurt too?

336
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,627
Yes.

337
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:30,609
The best way to drink yogurt is making
a whole at the bottom and suck it out.

338
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:31,607
I drink it like that too.

339
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:33,316
Sometimes,
I drink bottled water the same way.

340
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:33,910
What?

341
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,992
I do it too for canned beer.

342
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,785
We have some similarities.

343
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:38,991
It's so cool.

344
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:40,780
Seunghyun,

345
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,389
I'm little hungry.
Shall we have some instant noodle?

346
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:46,341
-Instant noodle sounds good.
-What shall I put in instant noodle?

347
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,651
Kimchi?

348
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:50,454
Not that kind of things.
Do you have any pork belly?

349
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,229
I usually put some pork
bellies into instant noodle.

350
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:56,037
-I like to eat it that way too!
-That's amazing!

351
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,324
-Seriously.
-Wait.

352
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,936
-What's up with the clap?
-I clap like this usually.

353
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,539
I've been clapping like this
since I was in kindergarten.

354
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,557
I've been clapping like that
since I was in kindergarten too.

355
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,962
I copied the way I clap
from senior in class "Seal".

356
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,153
-Which kindergarten did you go?
-Hansol kindergarten at Hwakok-dong.

357
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:15,431
What? Me too!

358
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,431
Are you for real?

359
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,534
So that senior from class "Seal"...

360
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:21,240
-...was you?
-I guess it was me!

361
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:23,532
-This is so fascinating!
-This is so fascinating!

362
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:26,626
We are from... Wow!

363
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,379
The smell of pork belly instant noodle.

364
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:32,976
Seunghyun,

365
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,380
is it not ready yet?

366
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:35,673
It's almost done!

367
00:17:37,778 --> 00:17:40,879
Here comes the instant noodle!

368
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:49,386
It's so hot.

369
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,888
Jungi, are you okay? Are you hurt?

370
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:54,483
Yes, I'm okay.

371
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,676
Is your hand alright?

372
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,984
It stings a little.

373
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:02,079
But I'm alright.

374
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:07,141
Gee, what should I do? Your hand...

375
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,729
I said, I'm fine.

376
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,624
Seunghyun...

377
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,337
"Recording"

378
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,024
Okay, I think it's enough for today.

379
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,016
Thank you.

380
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,408
How was it?

381
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,519
Yes, it was better than last time.

382
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:50,907
But you still lack of
putting detailed emotions.

383
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:53,305
Don't worry. You are getting
much better than last time.

384
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,821
-Yes, sir.
-You should go home early today.

385
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,836
I should go home and get some sleep too.

386
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:01,430
Yes, you should.
You haven't slept for few days.

387
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,630
The lyrics of this song...

388
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:07,233
-...were written by you, right?
-Yes.

389
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,002
-What about it?
-Lyrics are so sad.

390
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:11,623
Did you...

391
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,941
-...write while thinking about Suyeon?
-What?

392
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,314
Why are we talking about
Suyeon out of blue?

393
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,109
Because Suyeon is...

394
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:22,299
...your first love.

395
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,406
If you have time to worry about
those, mind your conditions first.

396
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:28,696
I will head out first.

397
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:37,427
Writing proposal is harder than I thought.

398
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,237
I don't really have much time.
This is not good.

399
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,003
Hey,

400
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,616
-Suyeon.
-Hey.

401
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:51,409
You just arrived? You are late.

402
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:53,718
-Yes, recording just finished.
-I see.

403
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:55,821
What are you doing this late night?

404
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,821
I'm writing proposal for new segment.

405
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:59,780
-New segment?
-Well...

406
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,486
I'm planning on new segment
where we can answer things...

407
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:04,605
...that are nothing but still
curious to know in our daily lives.

408
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:07,097
-Really? That sounds fun.
-You think so?

409
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:10,898
-But I can't think of any examples.
-Then,

410
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,193
do you want me to help?

411
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,406
I have few things that
I was curious to know.

412
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,492
What are they?

413
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:19,866
-You know Hulk, right?
-Yes.

414
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,059
Hulk is usually small,
but he gets large when he's angry.

415
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:25,668
When he gets large,
other clothes get ripped...

416
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:28,057
...but not his pants. How weird is that?

417
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,144
-Aren't you curious to know?
-Yes.

418
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,747
I am, but...

419
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:33,937
...it's bit off from our concept.

420
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:35,246
Is that so?

421
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,142
Okay, what about this?

422
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:39,736
We usually put earphones
in our bag or pocket.

423
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,633
They were fine when we put them,

424
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,244
but they're all tangled
up when we take them out.

425
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:47,425
It's not like someone tangled them
on purpose. It's such a mystery.

426
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,788
Yes, you are right.
I've been curious about it too!

427
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:51,978
And we usually wake up late.

428
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,771
But when we ask other
person to wake us up,

429
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,097
we always wake up before
the time we need to wake up.

430
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:59,045
-I want to know why it happens.
-Me too, me too.

431
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,039
Wow,

432
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,950
I couldn't think of anything when
I was thinking about it alone.

433
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:05,141
It solved out so easily
after talking to you.

434
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,437
Thanks, Wooshik.

435
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:08,245
Hey, it's nothing.

436
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,141
I bet you are really tired since you
haven't been sleeping. Get some rest.

437
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,897
It's okay. I'm totally fine.

438
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:15,215
I slept at studio, so I feel fresh.

439
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,595
Let's see. What else do we have?

440
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:26,376
Let's see...

441
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:28,574
-This part...
-Yes.

442
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,880
"Waikiki Guest House"

443
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,768
Hey, Kibong.

444
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,260
It's already late night.

445
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:45,233
Let's get some sleep and do it tomorrow.

446
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:46,923
If you are tired,
you should go to sleep first.

447
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:49,329
I will finish it even I
have to stay all night.

448
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:51,228
Okay.

449
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,630
Understood.

450
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:58,336
By the way, Yuri.

451
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,832
I have something to ask you.

452
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:01,934
What is it?

453
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:06,644
Did you really have to buy this?

454
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:07,447
What?

455
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:09,426
There's so many furnitures
that are already assembled,

456
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,719
but why did you have to
buy this kind of furniture.

457
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:14,122
I just wondered.

458
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,123
I told you before.

459
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,917
I did it to save money.

460
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:21,534
So how much did you save?
Did you save one million won?

461
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,547
No,

462
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,731
it's not that much.

463
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,151
But it's good to buy it cheap.

464
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:28,756
Okay.

465
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:32,747
I will assemble even if my
eyes fall out or disk relapses.

466
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:34,834
Good night, cheapskate.

467
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:47,107
It's already light outside. Gosh.

468
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:48,996
What?

469
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,158
Kibong.

470
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:52,666
Three...

471
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:57,675
Did you really stay all night up?

472
00:22:57,771 --> 00:23:00,913
-I'm calculating so don't talk to me.
-What?

473
00:23:04,827 --> 00:23:05,619
Okay.

474
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,117
But Kibong,

475
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,823
we need to get ready.

476
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,124
I'm sorry, but...

477
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,925
...I will not move a step
out of this room until I'm done.

478
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:17,917
So you go alone.

479
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,024
What?

480
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:23,032
You know I'm not really
good at driving a truck.

481
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:26,024
Then you can just hire a daily driver.

482
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,125
What?

483
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:28,436
Hey,

484
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,024
why would I hire a daily driver
over food truck business?

485
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,127
You said, you save money by buying this.

486
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:35,406
You can hire daily driver with it.

487
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:37,719
-You seriously...
-Hey,

488
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:39,700
I told you, I need to focus.

489
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:48,104
One... Two...

490
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:50,106
Fine, fine.

491
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:52,119
I got it.

492
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:54,501
I will go out alone.

493
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:55,905
What?

494
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,310
Where did you come from?

495
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:08,043
I would have done something,
if he wasn't my boyfriend.

496
00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:10,803
Be patient.

497
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,805
Patience.

498
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:14,709
What's the number for daily driver?

499
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,610
You startled me.

500
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:27,701
When did you wake up?

501
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,011
An hour ago.

502
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:32,804
Why didn't you wake me up?
I bet your arm is in pain.

503
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,396
Not at all.

504
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:37,483
Your head was so light,

505
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,293
it was not in pain at all.

506
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:41,606
Right, do you know...

507
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,398
...you sleep like a little angel?

508
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,592
Your snoring was so cute too.

509
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,678
Stop it. What's with you?

510
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:53,670
Don't you think...

511
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:57,570
-...we are much closer?
-I know right?

512
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:58,967
Actually,

513
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:00,777
being your arm around my
head felt so comfortable.

514
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,268
So I slept more soundly than ever.

515
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:04,079
Me too, me too.

516
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:08,080
It was the sweetest sleep
that I ever had in few days.

517
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,475
I'm glad.

518
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,372
-We should get washed up.
-Are you going to take a shower?

519
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:15,842
Let's go together.

520
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:16,744
Sure.

521
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:19,847
What did I...

522
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,111
-...say our relationship was?
-I am your man who is a friend.

523
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:26,322
In short form, a male
friend, your majesty.

524
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:27,504
But...

525
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:30,500
I see you as more than my male friend.

526
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:31,608
What should I do?

527
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:34,408
Your Majesty...

528
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,860
Gonggul...

529
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:39,145
Gonggul...

530
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,153
Gonggul.

531
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:42,764
Your Majesty...

532
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:44,153
Gonggul.

533
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:48,997
Gonggul.

534
00:25:49,092 --> 00:25:50,591
You know,

535
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:54,083
I can feel that they love each other,

536
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:56,391
but isn't it a bit too much?

537
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:57,379
You are right.

538
00:25:57,464 --> 00:26:00,150
It's overly too much.

539
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:03,045
What happened to them these few days?

540
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:05,253
Tell them, they no long
need to stick together.

541
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:07,356
-And don't ever put them together.
-Yes, sir.

542
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:09,655
Don't let them ever talk
to each other, got it?

543
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,860
Yes, understood.

544
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:13,759
"Waikiki Guest House"

545
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:15,861
Gosh, I'm so tired.

546
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:20,163
What a waste of money for daily driver.

547
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:22,750
Anyway,

548
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:25,664
is kibong done with assembly?

549
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:33,774
Kibong!

550
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:39,927
What's wrong with you?

551
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:43,738
-Did something happen?
-Yuri.

552
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,834
I can't do it.

553
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,537
-What?
-I can't do it anymore.

554
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,898
I start over from the
scratch over 100 times,

555
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,793
it changes every single time,

556
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,596
and I keep having left over parts.

557
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:01,379
It doesn't work no matter what I do.

558
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:04,705
I wanted to look cool in front of you,

559
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:06,697
so I did my best.

560
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,055
I'm sorry, Yuri.

561
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,357
What is wrong with me?

562
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,737
I'm not smart and I have nothing I can do.

563
00:27:15,746 --> 00:27:19,350
-I'm so useless.
-No, you are not.

564
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,556
You had such a good job with assembly.

565
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:25,650
I like this form than the original.
I'm telling you the truth.

566
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,223
-Really?
-Yes.

567
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:30,926
It's totally my type.

568
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:34,812
Wow, you will do great
with furniture designing.

569
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:38,414
You are right. I have some talent in art.

570
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:41,589
Of course, you are my boyfriend after all.

571
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,184
I didn't know you would like it this much.
I worried for nothing.

572
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:48,079
So don't worry about
it, and get some rest.

573
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:51,499
-You haven't gotten to sleep.
-Okay, I will get some rest then.

574
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,791
Yuri, use it well.
And this is your present.

575
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,301
I don't know where this came from.

576
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,542
I will use it well, Kibong.

577
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,788
How am I going to use it
well, looking like that?

578
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,788
What the heck is this?

579
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:18,873
Should I do it all over again by myself?

580
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:21,819
Then he will be sulky again.

581
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:23,643
I should just use it.

582
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:26,453
How the heck did he do this?

583
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,059
This is so uncomfortable!

584
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,162
What is this seriously?

585
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:39,256
What?

586
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,562
Where did he put the handle at?

587
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:43,863
My god.

588
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,062
He put the handle inside.

589
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:52,408
Having a child like boyfriend is...

590
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,306
...tiring, so tiring.

591
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,314
I wonder what happened to the proposal.

592
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:01,909
I hope producer likes it.

593
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,102
What happened? What did producer say?

594
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:09,109
You see,

595
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:11,411
he likes the idea!

596
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:13,876
Really?

597
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,590
-Does he really like it?
-Yes.

598
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:19,478
He wants to present in front of
the director few days later.

599
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:23,033
-Once we get passed, will be it official?
-Of course.

600
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:25,233
So I even thought about the title.

601
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:28,035
"Useless Questions that
Strike Our Curiosity"

602
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:30,328
In short form, UQSC.

603
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,431
Wow, that sounds nice.

604
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,336
-It's so fun.
-And I will put your name..

605
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,217
...in front of the title.

606
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,983
"Han Suyeon's UQSC"

607
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:39,578
Pardon?

608
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:42,973
There will be my name in segment's title?

609
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:46,148
Yes, we should definitely put your
name, since it was your idea.

610
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,957
If it works out well,

611
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,266
it will be a fixed
segment under your name.

612
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:55,047
So let's work hard for it, okay?

613
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,237
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:59,912
Thank you.

615
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:08,513
It will be my fixed
segment under my name.

616
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:09,516
Wow,

617
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,315
how could this happen?

618
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:13,445
I'm so happy.

619
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,048
It's all thanks to Wooshik.

620
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:21,531
Shall I buy some hotteok for Wooshik?

621
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:25,694
Hey, Suyeon.

622
00:30:26,001 --> 00:30:27,211
Wooshik, it's me.

623
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,013
-Would you like some hotteok?
-Hottoek?

624
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:30,112
Are you craving for hottoek?

625
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,215
Do you want me to get you some?
I'm front of the hotteok cart.

626
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:33,118
Really?

627
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:35,032
I'm near by as well...

628
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:44,317
How many do you want?

629
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,202
How many do you want, Suyeon?

630
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,004
500.

631
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,507
What?

632
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:53,787
I said, buy 500. 500!

633
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:59,287
What? Suyeon, Suyeon!

634
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:01,886
She hung up.

635
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:03,583
What's wrong?

636
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:04,983
What?

637
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,868
No, it's nothing.

638
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:10,128
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

639
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,422
How long does it take for
you to cook 500 hotteoks?

640
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:27,022
What was that?

641
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,119
Why was I mad at Wooshik?

642
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,514
Why would I?

643
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:43,300
Hey, what's up?

644
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:45,172
Here's hotteok.

645
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,777
But I couldn't buy 500 of them,

646
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:52,465
because hotteok lady doesn't
have enough ingredients.

647
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:54,052
-Is it okay?
-What?

648
00:31:54,354 --> 00:31:56,059
Yes, it's fine.

649
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:59,583
Wooshik, I'm little tired.

650
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,495
Okay, understood.

651
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:02,677
Get some rest.

652
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:11,789
What's with me?

653
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,194
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

654
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,063
It's hot.

655
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:27,069
Here comes instant noodle!

656
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,459
-Ta-da!
-Wow, you cooked it well.

657
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,371
Kook Kibong's instant noodle is the best!

658
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:35,471
You are right. Shall I give it a try?

659
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:38,480
Lee Jungi, stop right there.

660
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:39,973
What? What's wrong?

661
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,970
You haven't cured your pile.

662
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:46,700
-Do you know how bad spicy food for it?
-It's fine, it's fine.

663
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:49,502
Do you know how important
food is in our life?

664
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:51,509
I said, no.

665
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:52,778
Wait for a while.

666
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,578
-I will cook samgyetang with abalone.
-What?

667
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:57,578
Abalone?

668
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,485
Why? Is abalone good for pile?

669
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,480
No, it's not that. You will be
performing, starting from tomorrow.

670
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,579
So I want to tone your body, why?

671
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:05,968
Wait.

672
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:08,276
-Tomorrow is your first performance?
-Yes.

673
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:10,767
Yuri and I can't go because of business.

674
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,577
I can't go because of my recording too.

675
00:33:13,665 --> 00:33:17,373
Forget it, you jerks!
I never put hope to you guys.

676
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:20,680
Only my best friend thinks of me.

677
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:22,394
I'm only your best friend
at this kind of situation, right?

678
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:25,667
I'm going to watch it with my friends,

679
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:28,163
-so you better do good.
-Don't worry about it.

680
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,357
I will book the good seats only,
so bring all of your friends.

681
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:36,756
"King's male friend"

682
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:45,644
Gosh, why am I so nervous?

683
00:33:46,128 --> 00:33:47,929
I'm going crazy.

684
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,127
-Jungi!
-Who...

685
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,143
-Here.
-What?

686
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:57,532
You are here. Thanks for the flowers.

687
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,236
What's up?

688
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,448
-Why do you look so down?
-What?

689
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,836
Well...

690
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,616
I'm so nervous.

691
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,908
It's been a while since I
acted in front of audiences.

692
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:14,813
I can't even remember my
lines, and I'm out of my mind.

693
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,210
Hey.

694
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,708
What if I ruin the play?

695
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:21,897
Why are you getting scared unlike you?

696
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,093
Yes...

697
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:28,613
Buddy!

698
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,534
Just trust yourself.

699
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,514
You are really good at acting.
I approved it.

700
00:34:33,687 --> 00:34:37,086
You are Song Kangho, Hwang Jungmin,

701
00:34:37,171 --> 00:34:38,980
and Lee Byunghun to me.
You know that right?

702
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:43,428
So don't be scared. Just show
them what a real act is.

703
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:44,428
You got that?

704
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,357
Okay, okay. I got it.

705
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,039
I can't hear you.

706
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,045
I said, can you do it?

707
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,649
Okay, I heard you.

708
00:34:57,744 --> 00:35:00,945
I need to do my make up all over
again because of you. You little...

709
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:02,546
Now you look like yourself.

710
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,832
Anyway thanks.

711
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:08,355
I feel a little better thanks to you.

712
00:35:09,737 --> 00:35:10,633
Jeongeun?

713
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,645
-We need to enter now.
-Okay, understood.

714
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:14,627
Who is he?

715
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:17,239
He's my friend who does shooting with me.

716
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:19,541
Then good luck with your performance.
You can do it!

717
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,039
Let's go.

718
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:29,348
Yes,

719
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:30,946
I can do it.

720
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:32,859
Let's do this!

721
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:34,962
I wish...

722
00:35:35,157 --> 00:35:37,343
...time just stops at this moment.

723
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,550
Shall we just run away to somewhere far?

724
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,654
A place like in the forest
that nobody can look for us.

725
00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:43,546
And we can live happily with each other.

726
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,537
What do you say?

727
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,348
Thank you for your kind words,

728
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,544
but I can't, Your Majesty.

729
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,935
What do you mean,

730
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,741
you can't?

731
00:35:55,832 --> 00:35:57,032
I must...

732
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:59,847
...leave you now, Your Majesty.

733
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,059
Leave?

734
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:03,184
To where?

735
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,734
To Seoul, 2019.

736
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,542
What do you mean 2019?

737
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:17,036
What are you saying?

738
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,138
Actually,

739
00:36:18,316 --> 00:36:20,713
I'm from Seoul, Republic of Korea in 2019.

740
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:23,117
I'm a student of Myungsung
science high school.

741
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:25,221
While I was working on this time machine,

742
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:27,915
I accidentally came to this place.

743
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,119
What? Time machine?

744
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:32,101
I don't have time to explain.

745
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:34,316
It's time for me to go, Your Majesty.

746
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,505
It was an honored...

747
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:37,592
...to live as...

748
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,595
...King's male friend.

749
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:44,487
Good bye.

750
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:47,764
My male friend.

751
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:02,501
Go... Gonggul.

752
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:03,822
Gonggul.

753
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,122
Gonggul.

754
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:07,821
Gonggul!

755
00:37:49,257 --> 00:37:51,352
I wonder if Jungi has performed it well.

756
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:52,843
I feel bad, I didn't go.

757
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:57,368
I should finish it fast, so I could go.

758
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:00,042
Why is everyone so late?

759
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:06,239
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, you are late.

760
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,659
-What's up with your face?
-Yesterday night,

761
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:13,620
I had some drinks after recording,
and I'm having sour stomach.

762
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:15,555
Minah hasn't reached yet, right?

763
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:19,038
I will rest at the sofa until she comes.

764
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:21,134
Gosh, I'm about to die.

765
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,135
Hello, sir.

766
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,333
-What? What's wrong with your voice?
-Well...

767
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:33,118
I'm suffering from enteritis.

768
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:34,041
Enteritis?

769
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,038
How come?

770
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,816
After the recording,
to have some fresh air,

771
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,309
I went out and ate grilled clam
at the beach with my friends.

772
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,312
And it must have gone wrong.

773
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:44,605
What?

774
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,229
What the heck are you thinking?

775
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,423
How can you think of going to beach,

776
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:51,220
when you are recording
your album to be a singer?

777
00:38:51,316 --> 00:38:52,745
And you call yourself as a professional?

778
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:56,341
Back then, whenever I had a
recording, I wrapped...

779
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:59,429
...a scarf around my neck to
protect my throat in the middle of summer.

780
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:03,218
If you are a professional,
isn't it basic to take care of yourself?

781
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:05,933
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I don't want to hear it!

782
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:08,727
Same goes to you too.

783
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:11,959
You know we have recording today,
and how can you come here half drunk?

784
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:14,951
You shouldn't cause a trouble,
while we are working at least!

785
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,659
You guys have no self discipline.

786
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,574
-Sorry, sir.
-Forget it.

787
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:21,660
I'm so...

788
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:23,668
...disappointed in you all.

789
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,263
Sir!

790
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,955
-Hey, Suyeon. What are you doing?
-Yes?

791
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,257
Can't you see? I'm vacuuming.

792
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:52,203
I said, I want 500, 500!

793
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:59,002
Why do I keep bothering about
Wooshik and Minah being together.

794
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,673
Do I really like Wooshik?

795
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:11,955
Suyeon,

796
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:13,864
you have gathered around all
the picture references, right?

797
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:14,958
Yes, ma'am.

798
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,962
Our director is a difficult man.

799
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,756
We need to prepare perfectly.

800
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,062
I think we need to stay
up all night again.

801
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:24,156
Are you okay with it?

802
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,346
Of course, don't worry about me.

803
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,438
Let's start.

804
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:31,136
That's right.

805
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,042
It isn't the time for
me to think about Wooshik.

806
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:37,330
The most important thing
for me right now is work.

807
00:40:37,847 --> 00:40:40,441
Let's stop bothering about
other things and just work.

808
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:51,592
Gosh, it's boring. It's so boring.

809
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,188
Why isn't anyone coming back home?

810
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:57,093
I'm bored to death.

811
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,912
Why isn't Jeongeun coming
back until this late?

812
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,205
-That little...
-I'm back!

813
00:41:07,206 --> 00:41:08,999
Hey! Why are you getting in just now?

814
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:11,208
You should be more careful
even though you are ugly!

815
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:13,807
Were you with that guy?

816
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:14,687
Yes.

817
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:17,262
Jungi, you know? Minjun wants to...

818
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,572
...start dating with me formally.

819
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:20,563
What?

820
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,969
So...

821
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,446
...did you say yes?

822
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,969
I told him, I will think about it.

823
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:26,978
But...

824
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:28,084
...I'm thinking
to date with him.

825
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:31,298
What do you mean date?
You don't even know him that well!

826
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,283
Why? Minjun is a nice man.

827
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:36,387
How do you know if he's nice?
You don't even have a good taste of men.

828
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,282
What?

829
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:40,984
Why do you care,
if I date with him or not?

830
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:41,690
What?

831
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:50,708
I'm worried that you might suffer from
meeting someone like Sangwoo again! What!

832
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:51,915
You think so?

833
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,406
Then what should I do?

834
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,818
Bring him over first.

835
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,343
I will let you know if he's okay to date.

836
00:41:59,423 --> 00:42:01,629
Man knows man.

837
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:02,517
Really?

838
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:03,920
Okay.

839
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:09,723
-Gee, I'm so pissed off!
-What, what? Something happened?

840
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,114
I had some incident in recording studio.

841
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,718
Is there anymore ice?

842
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:17,019
-I think it's in the fridge.
-Okay.

843
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:19,601
They have no professionalism.

844
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:21,100
Gosh!

845
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,198
Anyway set the date soon.
I will take a careful look at him.

846
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:29,112
Very meticulously.

847
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:31,198
I have bad feeling about him.

848
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,005
"Waikiki Guest House"

849
00:42:33,098 --> 00:42:34,907
How dare I, Your Majesty?

850
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,985
I'm here,

851
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:39,969
and you're there.

852
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,677
-Jungi.
-Yes?

853
00:42:43,781 --> 00:42:46,743
I'm planning to go watch your play
with Yuri because it's our off day.

854
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:47,845
What time does it start?

855
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:49,637
I don't perform today.

856
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:50,552
Really?

857
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:51,763
Then when do you?

858
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,044
I perform a day after tomorrow,

859
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,735
so come with guys.
I will book good seats for you guys.

860
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:56,733
Sure.

861
00:42:58,132 --> 00:42:58,732
What?

862
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,439
I thought Wooshik has recording
early today, and he's still asleep.

863
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:07,250
Hey, aren't you going for recording?

864
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:10,913
Wooshik, wake up.

865
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:14,405
What's wrong, Wooshik?

866
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,507
Are you ill?

867
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:17,101
Well...

868
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:20,206
I felt cold since last night,

869
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:23,395
-and I'm having a fever.
-Gee.

870
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:26,199
You were chewing all the
ice with short sleeves on.

871
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:27,674
No wonder you get sick.

872
00:43:27,762 --> 00:43:29,285
You think so?

873
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,771
You have no choice.

874
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,555
Why don't you get off
for recording today?

875
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:33,959
No way.

876
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:36,858
The company wants me to
complete it as soon as possible.

877
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,056
I will be fine after getting
a shot from hospital.

878
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,365
Gosh, I feel awful.

879
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:55,089
I feel even more foggy after
getting a shot and having medicine.

880
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:01,033
I think I should postpone
today's recording.

881
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:13,865
-You are here, sir!
-You are here, sir!

882
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:16,078
What?

883
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:17,779
Why are you all so early today?

884
00:44:17,883 --> 00:44:21,396
I'm sorry for yesterday. I think
we were lacked of professionalism.

885
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,586
We will get back to our
senses and work hard, sir.

886
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,595
I'm much better after
getting IV from hospital.

887
00:44:26,683 --> 00:44:28,984
I will never make such mistake.

888
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,475
I'm so sorry.

889
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,194
What?

890
00:44:31,873 --> 00:44:32,578
Okay.

891
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:33,587
Sure.

892
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,587
We have prepared everything.
Shall we start with recording right away?

893
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,578
Right now?

894
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,380
This is crazy.

895
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:41,278
I don't think I can because I'm too sick.

896
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:43,397
I already said something like yesterday.

897
00:44:43,504 --> 00:44:46,277
I can't just say no now. What should I do?

898
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,171
What's wrong, Wooshik?

899
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:49,559
Are you not well?

900
00:44:49,865 --> 00:44:51,991
-You don't look so good.
-What?

901
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:53,466
No, no.

902
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:55,173
I'm okay.

903
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,569
I'm totally fine.

904
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:08,041
Sir.

905
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:10,932
That's my seat.

906
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:11,741
Yes?

907
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:13,328
Is it?

908
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:16,678
I just wanted to sit for a while.

909
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:21,179
It's cold. So cold.

910
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:22,980
Why do I feel so chilly.

911
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,445
-Why is it so hot in here?
-It's because of the heat of machines.

912
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:30,246
Shall I turn on the air conditioner?

913
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,540
Air conditioner?

914
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:34,531
Do we really have to turn it on?

915
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:37,030
My throat's condition gets
worse, when it's hot.

916
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,196
That can't be happened!
Singer's condition is most important.

917
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:42,292
-Put it low as you want.
-Okay.

918
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:48,147
I'm going crazy.

919
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,672
It's so cold. So cold.

920
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:58,258
Are you really my man?

921
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:00,545
This isn't like this...

922
00:46:01,348 --> 00:46:02,846
Jungi, Jungi.

923
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:05,363
-Minjun has arrived.
-Really?

924
00:46:05,744 --> 00:46:07,743
Okay! Kibong, let's go!

925
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,465
What?

926
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:09,957
-Me as well?
-Yes, you.

927
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:12,953
Jeongpal's future depends on it.
Don't you think?

928
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:14,542
Let's go!

929
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,033
I need to play this game.

930
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:19,621
Stop talking about the game.
Come on. Hurry!

931
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,636
Thanks for inviting me to your
house, Jeongeun.

932
00:46:25,738 --> 00:46:26,646
No, it's nothing.

933
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:29,519
My friends wanted to see you so bad.

934
00:46:29,604 --> 00:46:30,904
Really?

935
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:32,310
I'm getting nervous.

936
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,611
Let's cut the crap that
comes out from drama.

937
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,582
Let's just get to the point.

938
00:46:39,092 --> 00:46:41,091
I already know your name.

939
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:43,195
How big is your family?

940
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,798
I have a brother and a sister.
I'm the second one.

941
00:46:44,878 --> 00:46:48,186
Second... Second..
He's in the middle, okay.

942
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:49,789
What about your place?

943
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:51,186
Is it small?

944
00:46:51,484 --> 00:46:52,280
Long term release?

945
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:53,572
Or monthly rent?

946
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:54,866
Rent?

947
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:55,978
Monthly?

948
00:46:56,082 --> 00:46:56,774
Sorry?

949
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,465
Why do you ask?

950
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,767
I'm like Jeongeun's father and brother.

951
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:05,832
I wanted to know what kind
of man Jeongeun is seeing.

952
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:07,128
Why?

953
00:47:08,024 --> 00:47:09,126
You have something you can't say?

954
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:11,436
-No, it's not like that.
-Then, why don't you tell us?

955
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:14,935
-Sure, I live with my parents.
-Okay. Living together.

956
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:18,729
-What do you like about Jeongeun?
-Jeongeun?

957
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,937
She's pretty and very kind.

958
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:29,138
He said, she's pretty and kind!

959
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:33,634
You are funny!
You get 100 points for your humor. Good.

960
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:34,815
You passed.

961
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:36,600
Passed only for the humor.

962
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:43,030
What do you think? Isn't he nice?

963
00:47:44,022 --> 00:47:47,118
He's handsome and has great personality.
He seems like a good guy.

964
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,308
Hey, hey.

965
00:47:48,404 --> 00:47:50,705
What's the point for a man to have
handsome face and good personality.

966
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:52,618
Man is all about ability.

967
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,602
Ability is most important.

968
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,515
Minjun is CEO of game company.

969
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:58,602
Last year's sale was
around 10 billion won.

970
00:47:59,195 --> 00:47:59,995
10 billion?

971
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:02,483
Didn't you say he was an extra?

972
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,776
Being an actor is his dream.
So he acts, when he's has time.

973
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,787
He's successful and handsome.
You should go out with him, Jeongeun.

974
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:10,978
-Shall I?
-Don't courage her.

975
00:48:11,169 --> 00:48:13,978
What's the point of seeing
a successful and handsome man?

976
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:16,860
Man should be healthy. Healthy!

977
00:48:16,983 --> 00:48:18,661
Don't you know losing health
is same as losing everything?

978
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:22,479
He won gold medal for national triathlon.

979
00:48:22,558 --> 00:48:23,358
What?

980
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,171
Gold medal?

981
00:48:24,258 --> 00:48:26,869
Wow, he's perfect.

982
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:28,559
You should go out with him. You must!

983
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:31,353
Cut it out.

984
00:48:31,456 --> 00:48:35,967
Man is not all about handsome,
nice, successful, and healthy.

985
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,252
What else do you need?

986
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:41,357
If you want to find out man's true
nature, we need to make him drunk.

987
00:48:41,445 --> 00:48:41,953
Drunk?

988
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:45,460
You should find a man who can control
himself even though he's drunk.

989
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:48,054
That kind of man will not make you suffer.

990
00:48:48,254 --> 00:48:49,054
So?

991
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,634
I will take care of it.
You guys just watch.

992
00:49:00,152 --> 00:49:01,159
Minjun.

993
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:03,373
-Let's go have a drink with me.
-Sorry?

994
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:04,856
Let's go have a drink.

995
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:06,063
Why?

996
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:07,761
Can't you drink?

997
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,555
-No, it's not like that.
-Okay, let's go!

998
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:12,857
Come on!

999
00:49:29,918 --> 00:49:31,533
What's wrong with him, Minjun?

1000
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,438
He got drunk after few glasses.

1001
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:39,780
♪ What is your name? Park Yido!

1002
00:49:41,538 --> 00:49:43,032
There he goes again.

1003
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,926
I can't believe this punk, Gosh!

1004
00:49:57,827 --> 00:50:00,079
Sir, what do you think of this time?

1005
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:00,968
What?

1006
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:03,975
-What's wrong?
-I said, what do you think of this time?

1007
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,767
What's wrong? Wooshik!

1008
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,078
-What did you say?
-Do you like my singing?

1009
00:50:15,174 --> 00:50:15,974
Right.

1010
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:21,708
I think it was the best one
that you've done so far.

1011
00:50:22,107 --> 00:50:24,502
I can't remember it at all. At all!

1012
00:50:25,615 --> 00:50:28,010
Really? I'm glad.

1013
00:50:28,202 --> 00:50:29,407
I'm freezing.

1014
00:50:29,853 --> 00:50:31,542
That darn air conditioner!

1015
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:35,662
Why are you shivering?

1016
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,240
Well...

1017
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,560
I'm feeling a shudder because
your singing was so great.

1018
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:45,237
You even have a runny nose.

1019
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:46,132
Are you...

1020
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:48,440
-...having a flu?
-What?

1021
00:50:50,837 --> 00:50:52,446
Oh, this?

1022
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:55,731
Yes, I'm having a runny
nose but not due to flu.

1023
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:59,543
Actually, I get a runny nose
when I focus on my work.

1024
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:02,544
-You do?
-Okay, seems like...

1025
00:51:02,648 --> 00:51:04,831
...you've done a good job.
Shall we wrap it up?

1026
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:07,928
Already? I'm not satisfied with it.

1027
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:09,709
I want to do more.

1028
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,615
-Is that necessary?
-Yes.

1029
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:14,866
I want to do it until I'm
really satisfied with it.

1030
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:16,166
I see...

1031
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,985
You are very greedy.

1032
00:51:20,072 --> 00:51:21,778
It's because I'm your student.

1033
00:51:21,881 --> 00:51:23,066
Then I will start again.

1034
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:28,980
Gosh, I can't hold any longer.

1035
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:30,550
It's so cold!

1036
00:51:40,655 --> 00:51:41,851
Suyeon.

1037
00:51:43,163 --> 00:51:45,456
-Can you lend me the pink dress?
-Pardon?

1038
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:46,144
Why do you need it?

1039
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,457
Minjun wants to take
me to fancy restaurant.

1040
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,547
Is that so?

1041
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,143
-It's in the closet, you can take it.
-Thank you.

1042
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:06,676
Suyeon, are you still
preparing for the presentation?

1043
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:08,890
I need to present today,
so I have no time.

1044
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:10,676
You should take a break.

1045
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:13,150
What if you doze off during presentation.

1046
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:14,346
I guess...

1047
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:18,156
I should get some sleep for 30 minutes.

1048
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
It's nice.

1049
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,392
I should set the alarm first.

1050
00:52:45,005 --> 00:52:46,102
Sir,

1051
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:47,702
what do you think of this time?

1052
00:52:49,617 --> 00:52:50,617
Sir.

1053
00:52:51,307 --> 00:52:52,407
Yes, what?

1054
00:52:52,617 --> 00:52:55,409
You didn't answer, when I called you.

1055
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,603
I was thinking.

1056
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,008
No,

1057
00:53:00,227 --> 00:53:02,326
-I completely passed out.
-What?

1058
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:05,320
Both your nostrils are running now.

1059
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:06,008
What?

1060
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:09,915
Oh, this?

1061
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:13,074
Like I said, it's because I was so focused.

1062
00:53:13,177 --> 00:53:16,475
If I focus real hard,
both of my nostrils run.

1063
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:19,366
Let's take a break for 10 minutes.

1064
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:23,199
You all look so tired.

1065
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:24,905
No, it's fine.

1066
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:26,198
Let's just continue.

1067
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:28,500
Nonsense!

1068
00:53:28,612 --> 00:53:31,501
We need to rest time to time
for better quality of work.

1069
00:53:31,604 --> 00:53:34,309
Okay, then.
Let's continue after our toilet break.

1070
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,114
Are you really okay, sir?

1071
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:42,225
You don't look so good.

1072
00:53:42,312 --> 00:53:43,112
No, I do.

1073
00:53:43,435 --> 00:53:45,125
I'm totally fine.

1074
00:53:46,047 --> 00:53:47,128
Oh, my!

1075
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,133
What's wrong?

1076
00:53:50,534 --> 00:53:52,736
Who... Who is that man?

1077
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:55,694
Sorry?

1078
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:56,699
Who?

1079
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,097
That man with black clothes.

1080
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:01,397
Can't you see?

1081
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:02,714
What?

1082
00:54:03,606 --> 00:54:05,915
I don't see anyone. Is someone out there?

1083
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,331
I guess I was wrong.

1084
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:16,529
You seem weird today.

1085
00:54:16,823 --> 00:54:18,115
Wait.

1086
00:54:19,818 --> 00:54:21,415
Gee, so hot.

1087
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:23,904
-You are having fever.
-No, no.

1088
00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:26,670
I usually have high body temperature.

1089
00:54:26,773 --> 00:54:29,273
-I'm fine.
-You are not fine at all.

1090
00:54:29,376 --> 00:54:31,884
You are having high fever and runny nose.

1091
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:33,376
Sir.

1092
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:34,984
You are not well, right?

1093
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:36,379
Well...

1094
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:38,007
I think...

1095
00:54:38,092 --> 00:54:40,582
...I do have slight...

1096
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:43,580
-...fatigue.
-I knew it.

1097
00:54:43,684 --> 00:54:46,593
No wonder you keep wanting
to wrap today's recording.

1098
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,189
You scolded so much about how
I don't have professionalism,

1099
00:54:50,284 --> 00:54:51,870
and can't take care of myself.

1100
00:54:52,863 --> 00:54:53,758
Minah,

1101
00:54:54,676 --> 00:54:56,258
professionals may get sick too.

1102
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:57,268
But,

1103
00:54:57,574 --> 00:55:00,768
its about whether you are able to
tolerate or not. Your willpower...

1104
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:03,262
He appeared again!

1105
00:55:05,256 --> 00:55:06,156
Pardon?

1106
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:07,364
Who are you talking about?

1107
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:09,081
Grim Reaper! Grim Reaper!

1108
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:12,754
You have no choice.

1109
00:55:12,854 --> 00:55:15,465
You are not feeling well.
Let's just wrap it up.

1110
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,139
What?

1111
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,355
What are you talking about?
I'm professional!

1112
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,364
-I can do it, okay?
-Stop being stubborn.

1113
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,148
You are even seeing things.
How can you continue with recording?

1114
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:28,249
Okay, Minah. Shall we continue?

1115
00:55:29,155 --> 00:55:32,342
I'm sorry, but seems like
my enteritis has relapsed.

1116
00:55:32,448 --> 00:55:34,826
Can we wrap up here?

1117
00:55:35,622 --> 00:55:37,120
Ha... Has it?

1118
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:38,319
Yes.

1119
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:40,223
Sir?

1120
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:42,627
-What should we do?
-Pardon?

1121
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,714
-Well...
-Sorry, sir.

1122
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,713
I guess, I'm still lacking
of professionalism.

1123
00:55:48,893 --> 00:55:49,593
What?

1124
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,800
Hey.

1125
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:53,598
-What are you doing?
-Then, shall we just continue?

1126
00:55:56,574 --> 00:55:58,470
Minah, sorry. But...

1127
00:55:58,566 --> 00:56:00,566
...can you take me to the taxi?

1128
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,677
-I don't think I can walk alone.
-Gee.

1129
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:04,986
Okay.

1130
00:56:06,178 --> 00:56:09,272
-Okay, I will see you guys tomorrow.
-Good bye.

1131
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:14,942
Minah, let's hurry.
Someone keeps following me.

1132
00:56:26,184 --> 00:56:28,998
Gosh, this is killing me.
What if I'm really dying?

1133
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:32,276
What was it that followed me?

1134
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,189
Darn you!

1135
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:35,601
Gosh.

1136
00:56:35,802 --> 00:56:37,481
Why is he sleeping here?

1137
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:40,284
-What should I do?
-Suyeon.

1138
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:41,886
What happened?

1139
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:43,986
I have a presentation
about new segment today.

1140
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,079
I'm late for it because I dozed off.

1141
00:56:46,182 --> 00:56:48,785
This isn't good.
I didn't even practice for it.

1142
00:56:48,897 --> 00:56:49,681
What?

1143
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:55,688
-I will send you.
-Will you?

1144
00:56:56,893 --> 00:56:59,353
But you don't look so good.

1145
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,438
No, I'm fine.

1146
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:02,535
Really?

1147
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:04,525
I'm telling you the truth.

1148
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:06,152
You said, you are late. Let's hurry.

1149
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:08,483
I will send you off,
so practice in the car, okay?

1150
00:57:08,578 --> 00:57:10,578
Okay, thank you.

1151
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:11,981
Let's go.

1152
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,429
Thanks Wooshik.
I got just in time, thanks to you.

1153
00:57:23,525 --> 00:57:26,911
-It's nothing. You should go now.
-Okay, I will. Thank you again.

1154
00:57:27,626 --> 00:57:29,428
Good luck. You can do it, Suyeon!

1155
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:36,537
Gosh, my head.

1156
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:38,733
I should go and get some rest.

1157
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,490
Why do I feel so dizzy?

1158
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:56,502
-Excuse me, are you alright?
-Are you okay?

1159
00:57:56,589 --> 00:57:58,406
-Please call 911.
-Okay.

1160
00:57:58,486 --> 00:58:00,486
Sir, wake up. Sir.

1161
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,773
-Sir!
-Are you alright, sir?

1162
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,420
"Waikiki Guest House"

1163
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,240
Gosh, my neck!

1164
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,742
Gee, I'm dying. I'm dying.

1165
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:22,044
Geez, now you are awake?

1166
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:22,832
What?

1167
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:25,444
-Why am I sleeping here?
-Can't you remember?

1168
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:29,347
You said, you would make Minjun drunk.
But you got drunk instead.

1169
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:33,633
You spat on the floor, screaming,
and singing. You were a mess!

1170
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:38,016
-Really? I did?
-Yes, you did!

1171
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:40,610
Why do you keep bothering about that man?

1172
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:44,016
Are you jealous that Jeongeun
is seeing someone else?

1173
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:44,808
What?

1174
00:58:46,504 --> 00:58:47,704
What are you talking about?

1175
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:51,211
I'm just worried that Jeongeun
will suffer from seeing bad guys.

1176
00:58:51,505 --> 00:58:52,605
What the heck...

1177
00:58:52,721 --> 00:58:54,906
Don't you have any better things to say?

1178
00:58:57,295 --> 00:59:00,595
-That punk...
-Why is he getting mad for?

1179
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,372
How rude.

1180
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:05,351
Yes, hello?

1181
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:07,351
Cha Wooshik?

1182
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:09,049
Yes, he's my brother.

1183
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,351
Pardon?

1184
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:12,859
He's at hospital?

1185
00:59:17,494 --> 00:59:18,494
Suyeon.

1186
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:21,208
You are missing one picture.

1187
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:22,001
What?

1188
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:23,802
What happened?

1189
00:59:25,773 --> 00:59:28,375
I think I forgot to move
the file from pen drive.

1190
00:59:28,471 --> 00:59:30,772
I left my pen drive at home.
What should I do?

1191
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,666
Why don't you ask your housemates
to send it over by email?

1192
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,865
Okay, I should. Give me a minute.

1193
00:59:38,969 --> 00:59:41,169
"Cha Wooshik"

1194
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:47,182
The caller is unavailable at the moment...

1195
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:48,467
Why isn't he answering?

1196
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:52,213
Shall I contact Yuri?

1197
00:59:55,612 --> 00:59:56,712
Hello?

1198
00:59:57,206 --> 00:59:59,923
Yuri, it's me. Are you at home right now?

1199
01:00:00,003 --> 01:00:03,096
-No, I'm at the hospital.
-Hospital?

1200
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:04,509
Why are you at the hospital?

1201
01:00:04,613 --> 01:00:08,111
Wooshik passed out on the street,
so I'm at ER of Mirae Hospital.

1202
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:09,024
Pardon?

1203
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:10,612
Wooshik passed out?

1204
01:00:11,496 --> 01:00:14,097
-He was fine a minute ago.
-What?

1205
01:00:14,607 --> 01:00:16,580
Wooshik was with you?

1206
01:00:18,779 --> 01:00:21,983
I'm not sure what happened.
I will call you back later.

1207
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:28,416
Suyeon,

1208
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,822
what's wrong? Something happened?

1209
01:00:33,022 --> 01:00:34,115
Where are you going?

1210
01:00:34,219 --> 01:00:37,304
The director will be here soon. Suyeon!

1211
01:00:44,977 --> 01:00:46,475
Oh, my head.

1212
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:47,491
Wooshik,

1213
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:49,062
how are you feeling?

1214
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:50,591
Hey, Yuri.

1215
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:52,983
Where are we?

1216
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,813
-What do you think? We're in the hospital.
-Hospital?

1217
01:00:58,416 --> 01:00:59,202
Why am I here?

1218
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:01,607
You collapsed in front
of Suyeon's company.

1219
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:03,613
Why were you there?

1220
01:01:05,606 --> 01:01:08,709
Suyeon said, she's late for her meeting.
So I sent her off.

1221
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:09,501
What?

1222
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,460
Still, why would you go there
when you have high fever?

1223
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:14,460
You should have come to the hospital.

1224
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:17,063
But she was late for
important presentation.

1225
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:19,167
Gosh.

1226
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:21,469
Do you have any idea, how shocked I was?

1227
01:01:23,271 --> 01:01:25,839
-How did Suyeon's presentation go?
-Hey,

1228
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:27,927
it's not time for you to
worry about Suyeon right now.

1229
01:01:28,428 --> 01:01:30,934
Gee, you are such a fool.

1230
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:45,555
Yuri, I think I'm okay now. So can we go?

1231
01:01:45,755 --> 01:01:49,056
-I feel stuffy.
-Let's hear out what doctor has to say.

1232
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:51,348
God, I really feel stuffy.

1233
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,508
-Sir.
-Minah.

1234
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:04,008
-How did you...
-She called you.

1235
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:05,437
So I called her back.

1236
01:02:06,049 --> 01:02:07,049
Sir.

1237
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:09,549
You really are okay, right?

1238
01:02:09,653 --> 01:02:10,341
What?

1239
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:12,964
Of course, I'm really okay.

1240
01:02:13,758 --> 01:02:15,552
Thank god. I'm so glad.

1241
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:18,155
Hey, what's wrong? Get off of me.

1242
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:21,247
No, do you know how scared I was?

1243
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:24,646
Gee, what's with you? I said, I'm fine.

1244
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:27,749
I thought something happened to you.

1245
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:29,963
I haven't confessed it to you yet.

1246
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:31,452
What? Confess?

1247
01:02:31,962 --> 01:02:34,160
I like you as a man.

1248
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:36,162
What?

1249
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:14,425
"Welcome to Waikiki 2"

1250
01:03:14,806 --> 01:03:17,219
Sir, I'm here. I'm bit fussy, right?

1251
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:19,519
I really like him.

1252
01:03:19,614 --> 01:03:21,423
Suyeon and I are just friends.

1253
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:23,113
Good to hear that you got over her.

1254
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:25,934
"Just for one minute".
Is this the song that Wooshik composed?

1255
01:03:26,024 --> 01:03:27,728
Where is Wooshik right now, Jungi?

1256
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:29,418
He said he was going
to the studio just now.

1257
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:30,296
-Kibong!
-Who is she?

1258
01:03:30,384 --> 01:03:32,717
She's a part time bakery store near by.
I will go out for a bit.

1259
01:03:32,797 --> 01:03:34,995
"I will see you at the place
that we met yesterday"?

1260
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,796
Is Kibong cheating on me?
Kook Kibong, who is this girl? Who is she?

1261
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:40,002
Where are you going looking like that?

1262
01:03:40,097 --> 01:03:41,914
-I'm going on a date with Minjun.
-Again?

1263
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,899
-Then why don't you go and see someone.
-Close my eyes and count three.

1264
01:03:44,994 --> 01:03:49,002
And the girl who is in front of me
is my destiny. One, two, three!

1265
01:03:49,103 --> 01:03:51,293
You scared me! What are you doing here?

1266
01:03:51,396 --> 01:03:52,805
-Suyeon.
-Dad!

1267
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:55,187
We will need to go for this afternoon
flight, so pack your things first.

1268
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,987
-Do I have to go?
-Are we just going to let her go?
