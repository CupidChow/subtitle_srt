1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:03,103
I like you as a man.

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:04,602
What?

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,460
I said, I like you.

4
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,166
Why are you saying this all of sudden?

5
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:19,554
I will go out for a bit.

6
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,876
Hey, Suyeon.

7
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:28,199
-When did you come?
-Yes?

8
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,295
I just did.

9
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:31,484
Hey, Suyeon.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:32,975
How did you...

11
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,867
I heard you passed out,
while I was talking to Yuri on the phone.

12
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:37,672
What happened to you?

13
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:41,275
Well, he had high fever due to
fatigue, so he passed out.

14
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:42,472
Really?

15
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,277
Why didn't you say so?

16
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:47,662
All because of me...

17
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,122
It's not your fault.

18
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,042
So don't worry about it.

19
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:54,764
What about your presentation?

20
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:56,946
Well...

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,135
Suyeon.

22
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:01,342
I'm really okay, so you should go.

23
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,838
It's an important presentation for you.

24
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,242
You should go.

25
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:08,742
Okay.

26
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,228
Okay, I will.

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,003
Yes, ma'am.

28
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,791
Suyeon, what happened to you?

29
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,583
Sorry, I had some urgent matter.

30
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:48,897
What happened to presentation?

31
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:50,310
I did it alone.

32
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,999
You know, our proposal...

33
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,664
...is approved!

34
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,871
The director wants to
make it as fixed segment.

35
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:00,776
-I see.
-What's with this response?

36
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:02,864
I thought you would be happy.

37
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,469
No, I really am.

38
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:08,368
Anyway, we have lots of things to do.
So hurry back to the office, okay?

39
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:09,772
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,056
Is Wooshik okay?

41
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:31,672
Gosh, my stomach. It hurts.

42
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:35,553
Why is that Minjun guy
good at drinking too?

43
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,344
Gee, I don't like him at all.

44
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,439
I don't like him. He's not my type.

45
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,649
Here, drink this.

46
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:45,655
What is this?

47
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,033
It's honey water!

48
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,440
You said, man's true nature
comes when he's drunk.

49
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,948
But you were the one who got drunk.

50
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:52,534
Look at yourself!

51
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,039
It's all because I wasn't
feeling well yesterday.

52
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:56,738
You and your mouth.

53
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,237
Drink this already.

54
00:02:58,722 --> 00:02:59,829
Thanks.

55
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,227
So, hey...

56
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,227
-...are you seeing Minjun now?
-Yes.

57
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,821
-I'm just going to meet him casually.
-Casually?

58
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:08,319
Watch out for yourself.

59
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:10,621
-You will never know what he's thinking...
-Shut up.

60
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:13,510
You always have to watch out.

61
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,224
We are back.

62
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:17,018
Are you okay, Wooshik?

63
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:20,897
Yes, I feel better after
getting IV and some rest.

64
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:22,587
I will head inside first and rest.

65
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:23,793
Go on.

66
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,988
Wooshik doesn't look so good.

67
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,972
Is Wooshik still unwell?

68
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:33,078
Yes, that too.

69
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:34,275
Actually,

70
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,569
something unexpected happened.

71
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:37,776
What happened?

72
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:38,987
Minah told Wooshik,

73
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:40,884
that she likes him.

74
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,884
She did? Then, she has a crush on Wooshik?

75
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,982
I told you, something was fishy.

76
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,994
So? What happened next?

77
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,470
I'm not sure either.

78
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:54,863
Wooshik doesn't seem happy,
so I couldn't even ask.

79
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:58,954
"Waikiki Guest House"

80
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,350
-I'm okay.
-Careful with the stairs.

81
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,339
-Isn't it heavy?
-It's fine. It's so sunny today.

82
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,036
Yes.

83
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,534
I hope we have a lot of customers today,
so we can finish this ingredients.

84
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,533
I hope so too.

85
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:13,841
-Let's cheer up today, Kibong.
-Yes. Okay!

86
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:14,801
Kibong!

87
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:17,809
What are you doing here?

88
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:20,609
I feel grateful for you
to help with the pots,

89
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,200
so I've brought some breads.

90
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,103
You didn't have to do this.

91
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:27,595
Thank you. I will enjoy the bread, miss.

92
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:30,102
I told you, you don't have to be so
formal with me. I'm younger than you.

93
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,411
It isn't right to be informal,

94
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,504
just because you are younger than me.

95
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Then, you have to be informal next
time, okay? I will see you around.

96
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:40,706
Who is she?

97
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:43,008
She's new part time employee
at the bakery near by.

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,102
You helped her move the pots?

99
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,503
I went to buy some breads and I felt
bad when I saw her working by herself.

100
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:49,788
So I helped her.

101
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:51,601
We can eat this as a snack.

102
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:52,684
Let's go, Yuri.

103
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:53,898
Okay.

104
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,689
-You woke up early.
-What?

105
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,289
Yes...

106
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,991
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine as you can see.

107
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,787
Right, what happened...

108
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,899
...to your presentation, by the way?

109
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,698
-It's approved.
-Really?

110
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:25,915
That's great! Congratulations, Suyeon!

111
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,897
It's all thanks to you.

112
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,198
I didn't do much.

113
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,396
We should celebrate.

114
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:35,877
I can't because of recording today. So,

115
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:37,483
let's have a party on the weekends!

116
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,678
-Sure, why not.
-I'm here, sir.

117
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,385
What brings you here this morning?

118
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,373
I feel like you have
lost your strength,

119
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,476
so I wanted to cook
something nice for you.

120
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,778
I will make it soon,
so just wait for a while.

121
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:51,467
What's with you really?

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,254
-Look, Minah...
-Hold on.

123
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:59,452
It took me a few years to say. Shouldn't
you consider at least three days,

124
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,261
and answer?

125
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:04,876
-But the thing is...
-Go wash your hands already!

126
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:08,557
-Hurry!
-Okay, okay. I got it.

127
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,214
I'm bit fussy, right?

128
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:17,420
Sorry?

129
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:21,229
-No, not at all.
-Actually,

130
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:24,078
I really like him very much.

131
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,734
I met him, when I was in high school,

132
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,535
and I fell in love at first sight.

133
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,406
I was too young back then,

134
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,309
so I didn't have courage to tell him.

135
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:35,126
But this time, I had to muster
up the courage to tell him.

136
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,104
So help me out, Suyeon.

137
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:40,207
Please?

138
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,622
-Sure.
-Thanks, Suyeon.

139
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:51,416
Have fun then. I need to get to work.

140
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,010
Okay, Suyeon.

141
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:06,059
-Careful.
-Yes, careful.

142
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:11,681
Yuri, good work today.

143
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:14,167
You too. Good work, boyfriend.

144
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:16,665
What's with you? What if anyone sees us?

145
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,075
If I get caught by
Wooshik, he might kill me.

146
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:23,171
-Gee, you scary cat.
-There's nothing bad to be careful.

147
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:29,965
What's wrong?

148
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,771
What is it about?

149
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,577
It's nothing.

150
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:36,887
I will go out for a bit, Yuri.

151
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:38,370
Where do you have to go this late?

152
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:40,568
I just need to get some fresh air.

153
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,373
I will be back then.

154
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,077
We were outside until just now.

155
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,861
Why does he want to get fresh air again?

156
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,066
"Waikiki Guest House"

157
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:56,906
Right.

158
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,320
What are you going to do?

159
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,208
About what?

160
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:01,100
Minah told you that she likes you.

161
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:02,208
Are you going to accept?

162
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,212
Accept what? She's just my student.

163
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:05,995
So what?

164
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:08,806
Why is that even matter,
when she's all grown up now.

165
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,261
Wait.

166
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,063
Don't tell me,

167
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,683
it's because of Suyeon.

168
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,373
No, it's not!

169
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,660
I will take care of it,
so mind your business!

170
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,858
Why do you get mad at me?

171
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,256
Hey, Miss Kim Jeongpal!

172
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,118
What's going on?
Where are you going all dressed up?

173
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,663
-I'm going on a date with Minjun. Why?
-Again?

174
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,543
Meeting again,
when you guys met yesterday night?

175
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:38,146
Minjun said,

176
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:41,045
he misses me even though he sees me.

177
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:44,160
Gosh, that's corny.

178
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:47,263
I didn't know people
still talks like that.

179
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,779
Why? It's romantic!

180
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,171
No matter how I think,

181
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:53,568
I think Minjun and I are destiny.

182
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:56,464
-Destiny.
-Cut that crap out.

183
00:08:56,576 --> 00:09:00,172
Hey, you might end your destiny like that.

184
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,988
Be careful. Watch out of every man.

185
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:07,159
-Got it?
-You are the most dangerous among others.

186
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,468
See you guys!

187
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,847
Hey! Don't follow him to a mansion.

188
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,252
Put your seat belt on,
when you get in the car!

189
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,544
Stop it, you punk!

190
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:17,724
Jeongeun isn't a child. Why are you
being childish as if you are jealous.

191
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,233
Jealous my ass.

192
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,024
It's because I'm bored, okay?

193
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:25,021
She goes out on a date everyday,
and I have no one to bully.

194
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,813
What?

195
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,911
Just because you are bored,
she doesn't get to go on a date?

196
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:28,711
What?

197
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,120
Then, why don't you go on a date too?

198
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,929
You can hang out with your girlfriend.

199
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:35,417
Yes, I should!

200
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,115
You are right.

201
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:39,822
I've been neglected with my romance.

202
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,004
Okay.

203
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,116
Today,

204
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:45,796
I will meet the woman of my destiny.

205
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:49,911
Okay, this place is perfect.

206
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:52,212
I will meet the one
that I'm meant to be with.

207
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:54,306
Wait.

208
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,625
How am I going to look for the one?

209
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:00,720
Yes.

210
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,110
I will close my eyes, and count to three.

211
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:05,611
The one who stands in front
of me must be my destiny.

212
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:07,185
Good, good.

213
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,685
Shall I try now?

214
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,915
One...

215
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,292
Two...

216
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,298
Three!

217
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:20,090
I found her.

218
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:23,737
Excuse me.

219
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,362
-Yes?
-I think,

220
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:28,461
we are meant for each other.
Do you want to go out with me?

221
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:29,340
Sorry?

222
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,426
-Darling!
-Yes, darling.

223
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,417
What's wrong, honey?

224
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:36,917
Did something happen?

225
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:39,515
This man asked me to go out with him.

226
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:40,490
What?

227
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:42,498
Is that true?

228
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,107
Hello.

229
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:46,899
Do you want to go out with me?

230
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:51,703
You have a beautiful leaf.

231
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:54,212
What the... He must be crazy!

232
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,616
Let's just go, darling.

233
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:56,909
Gosh.

234
00:10:58,598 --> 00:10:59,798
Gee...

235
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:02,495
I almost got into a trouble.

236
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,298
Let's try again.

237
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:08,012
Yes. Start over.

238
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,202
One...

239
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:12,679
Two...

240
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:14,283
Three!

241
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,701
Destiny.

242
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:22,718
Excuse me.

243
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:25,615
I think we are meant for each other.

244
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:28,612
-Do you want to go out with me?
-Oh, my. Really?

245
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,612
I thought so too.

246
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:31,905
Really?

247
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,703
Yes.

248
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:34,107
Do you...

249
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,210
...believe in force?

250
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:40,006
-Force?
-You have full of misfortune.

251
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,117
Why don't we talk further over there?

252
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:44,744
I don't really want to hear about it.

253
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,839
Hey. Why is she so strong?

254
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,330
Kibong, let's go to do our business...

255
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,242
What?

256
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,242
He's not here.

257
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:55,409
He should organize his bed sheets.

258
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,995
This is Kibong's phone.

259
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:08,895
What the...

260
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:12,098
"Let's meet again at the
place we met yesterday night"?

261
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,483
Who is Shiny?

262
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:17,571
Don't tell me,

263
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,183
it's the bakery part timer yesterday?

264
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:21,883
That was refreshing.

265
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,780
-Yuri, what are you doing?
-Hey.

266
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,874
I was just cleaning your phone.

267
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:30,165
Get ready fast.
We need to prepare for our business.

268
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:31,458
Okay, understood.

269
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,520
What was that?

270
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,831
Then,

271
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,020
is Kibong cheating on me?

272
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,991
Gee, no way.

273
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,484
-Why did you want to see me?
-Well...

274
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,190
I've heard the recorded song.

275
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,682
And it seems like,
it doesn't suit with Minah that well.

276
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,872
Sorry to say this,

277
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:01,471
but we decided not to put
the song in her album.

278
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,670
Well,

279
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:04,077
that's too bad.

280
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,468
So I was thinking,

281
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:09,062
why don't we release that
song as your single album.

282
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:10,658
Pardon?

283
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,370
-What are you talking about...
-To me, it was...

284
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:16,250
...much better when you sang it.

285
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:18,566
Minah said yes gladly,

286
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:21,067
and company has approved.

287
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,749
What do you think?

288
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,033
Gosh.

289
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:52,938
Gee, I almost got dragged by that woman.

290
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,145
Okay. This time...

291
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,647
...will be my last. My last.

292
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,845
Even though,
man is standing in front of me,

293
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,559
I will take him as my destiny.

294
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:06,850
Okay, let's do this.

295
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:09,557
One...

296
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:12,255
Two...

297
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:14,462
Please... Three!

298
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,128
Oh, gosh!

299
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,540
Hey, Jeongeun...

300
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,524
What are you doing here...

301
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:27,628
I was going home after seeing Minjun,

302
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:30,028
and I saw some familiar looking punk.

303
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,314
But still,

304
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:34,825
why did you have to appear right now? Why?

305
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:37,029
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know!

306
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,012
Nothing works because of you!

307
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,923
Why is he getting mad at me?

308
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:45,508
Hey, Lee Jungi!

309
00:14:58,342 --> 00:14:59,341
I'm back.

310
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:01,833
-You are home early.
-Yes.

311
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:03,731
Suyeon,

312
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,243
I want you to congratulate
me on something.

313
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,342
-Really? What is it?
-You know,

314
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,130
-I'm releasing my album.
-Really?

315
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:15,430
Yes, the company wants me to sing

316
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,137
the song that I made.

317
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,843
They want to release as my single album.

318
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,246
Congratulations, Wooshik!

319
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:23,548
This is great, really great!

320
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,333
-Wooshik!
-Hey.

321
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:27,342
Minah.

322
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:31,539
I've heard the news. We should celebrate.

323
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,841
Let's throw a party.

324
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,836
Okay. Let's do it.

325
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:45,077
If your album becomes successful, you
need to let me feature sometimes. Okay?

326
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,386
I said, I got it. Gee.

327
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:51,078
Well, Minah. I'm sorry.

328
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,784
Don't be.

329
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,968
The version you sang sounds
much better to me too.

330
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,857
Let's not worry about that and just drink.

331
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,566
-Okay, thanks.
-Cheers.

332
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,366
My beer is already finished.

333
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,873
-Do we have more?
-Suyeon.

334
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,063
You seem drunk,

335
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,960
-why don't you stop drinking?
-No...

336
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:16,264
No, no.

337
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:17,761
I'm fine.

338
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,555
I'm okay.

339
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:21,850
I'm okay...

340
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,057
I'm back!

341
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:26,065
Hey, you are here.
Wow, what's up with that bouquet?

342
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,565
-Did you get it from your boyfriend?
-No.

343
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:29,148
It's for you.

344
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,862
I heard you are releasing an album.
Congratulations, Wooshik.

345
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:34,750
Thank you.

346
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:39,129
-By the way, what's wrong with Suyeon?
-Well...

347
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,542
She drank beer too fast. She's drunk.

348
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:44,341
Jeongeun, can you take her...

349
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,236
-...to her bed?
-Sure.

350
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,212
Suyeon.

351
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:49,419
Suyeon.

352
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:52,625
Hey.

353
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,429
You are here, Jeongeun.

354
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,429
-We should have more drinks.
-No.

355
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,143
You are already drunk.

356
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:00,129
-Let's go to the bed.
-I'm fine.

357
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,447
-I can have more!
-Let's go, let's go.

358
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:05,129
-Let's go in. Let's go in.
-Jeongeun, the beer...

359
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,431
No, let's just go in. Careful.

360
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:08,524
Careful now.

361
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:11,032
I'm really fine.

362
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,135
I can have more.

363
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:16,441
You are already drunk.
You should stop drinking and go to sleep.

364
00:17:17,724 --> 00:17:18,636
Wait.

365
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:22,222
-Why are you up again?
-I have something to say to Wooshik.

366
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:24,532
I really need to tell him.

367
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:27,152
Why don't you tell him tomorrow?

368
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,929
No, I can't.

369
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,548
I need to tell him now.

370
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,635
I don't think I will have
chance, if I don't tell him now.

371
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:37,143
Gee, you can tell him tomorrow.

372
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:38,622
No...

373
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,821
I need to do it now.

374
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:43,620
I will do it now.

375
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,830
-What's wrong, Suyeon?
-Let me go.

376
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:48,322
I said I need to tell Wooshik something.

377
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:49,921
I think you are very drunk.
Let's do it tomorrow.

378
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:51,921
No, I can't.

379
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:54,032
I really need to tell him now, Jeongeun.

380
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
You are drunk. Let's just get
some sleep and do it tomorrow.

381
00:17:56,204 --> 00:18:00,409
-No, I need to tell him now.
-You drank too much. Let's do it tomorrow.

382
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:05,701
Why does Jeongpal have to
appear at that moment? Why?

383
00:18:06,187 --> 00:18:06,987
Then,

384
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,598
are Jeongpal and I meant to be together?

385
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,380
Gee, that doesn't make sense!

386
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,311
This is what I recorded last time.

387
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:24,620
What do you think?

388
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:28,339
Hey, Lee Jungi.

389
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:29,554
-Hey!
-Yes?

390
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,951
What? What's wrong?

391
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,348
-What do you think of my song?
-What?

392
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,641
You weren't paying attention, right?

393
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:37,158
-No, I was listening.
-You...

394
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:38,650
It's nice!

395
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:41,453
This is the best among you made.

396
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,950
-You think so?
-Yes, it is.

397
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,429
I like...

398
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:47,835
...the lyrics for this song.

399
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,015
By the way,

400
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,317
you wrote this while
thinking about Suyeon, right?

401
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:53,111
What?

402
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:56,199
I guess I'm right.

403
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:57,387
Wait,

404
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,587
-do you still like Suyeon?
-No, I don't!

405
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:04,599
Suyeon and I are just friends.

406
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,900
-Are you for real?
-Yes!

407
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:08,903
So don't say that in front of Suyeon.

408
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,887
-Suyeon will be uncomfortable.
-Got it, you jerk.

409
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,896
I'm glad that you got over her.

410
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,984
You suffered a lot because of Suyeon.

411
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:22,024
"Waikiki Guest House"

412
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:25,024
"Yuri's kitchen"

413
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:30,432
Good work today, Yuri.

414
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,829
Yes. Well, you too.

415
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,917
Let's clean up quickly and get some rest.

416
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:41,763
What's wrong?

417
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:43,866
What is it about?

418
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:46,754
It's nothing.

419
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:49,363
I will go somewhere for awhile,

420
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:50,854
so you get some rest first.

421
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,855
I will clean it up, when I'm back. Okay?

422
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
Where are you going this time?

423
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:57,354
Just to get some fresh air.

424
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,454
I will be back.

425
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:03,653
What the...

426
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:07,666
Isn't he meeting that
bakery part timer, Shiny?

427
00:20:08,969 --> 00:20:10,564
Kook Kibong, that jerk.

428
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,168
You are a dead meat to me.

429
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,765
Where the heck is this jerk, Kibong?

430
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:21,173
I've searched every where
and I still can't find him.

431
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:23,066
Don't let me catch you.

432
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:29,728
Kook Kibong, that jerk...

433
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:36,256
Hey, Kook Kibong!

434
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:38,156
Yuri!

435
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:40,673
-How did you...
-Who is this woman?

436
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:42,060
I said, who is this woman?

437
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:45,068
-What are you talking about?
-Don't you dare lie to me!

438
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:47,060
I know she's the bakery part timer!

439
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,952
Who are you?

440
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:51,547
Who are you?

441
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,004
So you were the coach of baseball team.

442
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,415
-Hello.
-Yes,

443
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:04,594
-hello.
-Hi...

444
00:21:05,087 --> 00:21:06,484
Unbelievable.

445
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,482
You thought I was cheating you,
so you came all the way here?

446
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:10,894
Well...

447
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:13,897
Because you kept disappearing at night.

448
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:17,983
How weird...

449
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:21,709
I saw a text from Shiny.

450
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,223
Is that the reason why?

451
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:25,708
-That Shiny is my coach.
-What?

452
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,299
So the coach is Shiny?

453
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:29,386
Why?

454
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,350
What?

455
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:37,347
Hey, did you save me as...

456
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:39,351
...Shiny in your phone?

457
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,144
You little punk.

458
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:43,247
Sorry, sir.

459
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,241
That's your nickname.

460
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:49,547
By the way,

461
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:51,751
why are you meeting him this late night?

462
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,940
Well...

463
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,060
Coach wants me to become the batter.

464
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,241
Batter?

465
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:02,725
Then, you can play baseball again?

466
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,926
Of course!

467
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,638
He might be a pitcher,

468
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,330
but he was a great batter too.

469
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,522
I keep...

470
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:12,139
...thinking about his skill
and felt like it's a waste.

471
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,122
So I'm persuading him to start over,

472
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,122
but he's being stubborn.

473
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,129
I said, I no longer want to play baseball.

474
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,914
So stop visiting me.

475
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:24,119
Let's go, Yuri.

476
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,132
Hey, Kibong.

477
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:29,306
Kook Kibong!

478
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,915
I will clean all cooking tools,

479
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,923
so go to your bed first.

480
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,612
-Okay?
-Okay.

481
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:48,522
By the way, Kibong.

482
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:50,213
You...

483
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:52,609
...really don't want
to play baseball again?

484
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:53,409
What?

485
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:56,623
Yes.

486
00:22:57,598 --> 00:22:59,521
I will just stick with
food truck business.

487
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:01,906
We need to work hard
to open a chain store,

488
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,508
and become global.

489
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:05,914
Liar.

490
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,112
I know you smile like a
fool, when you're lying.

491
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,995
I know you want to play.

492
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,218
Am I right?

493
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,114
Why?

494
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,306
Are you scared?

495
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,229
To be failed again?

496
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:22,719
What?

497
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,407
My boyfriend is such a scary cat.

498
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,916
If I ever break up with you,

499
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:30,398
you wouldn't even stop, right?

500
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:31,900
Because you are scared
to get dumped again.

501
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,914
-That's not true.
-As if.

502
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,303
There's a way to play baseball again,

503
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,199
but you are hesitating
because you are afraid.

504
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:43,302
Do I need to keep seeing this kind of guy?

505
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:44,839
Changing to batter...

506
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:47,145
...isn't easy as you think.

507
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:48,843
Is that so?

508
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,043
Then, just quit it.

509
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:53,524
And...

510
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:55,254
...let's just break up.

511
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:56,151
What?

512
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,047
Where is this coming from?

513
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,763
I don't need a coward boyfriend.

514
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,057
This has been fun.

515
00:24:07,255 --> 00:24:08,451
What's with you?

516
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:10,854
No, never. I can't break up with you.

517
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:12,047
Then,

518
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:19,517
play baseball again.

519
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:21,728
I will...

520
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:23,726
...support you in any way I can.

521
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,319
I think,

522
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:28,017
I will be more proud to have...

523
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,025
...a boy friend who might
not know what to do,

524
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:33,195
but challenge himself for
his dream until the end,

525
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:35,406
than a coward boyfriend.

526
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:36,710
Kibong.

527
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,810
Don't be afraid.

528
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,724
You have me next to you.

529
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,923
Like I told you always,

530
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,530
just trust me.

531
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,021
Okay?

532
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,335
Thank you, Yuri.

533
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,438
Thank you so much.

534
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:58,651
Why are you so cool?

535
00:24:59,231 --> 00:24:59,931
I am?

536
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,528
You are so cool, I can't stand it anymore.

537
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,932
You got me no choice.

538
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:06,734
What?

539
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:29,590
"Waikiki Guest House"

540
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,387
What?

541
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,585
-You can play baseball again?
-Yes.

542
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:34,274
I'm thinking to switch to a batter.

543
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:37,663
-Well, it won't be easy.
-No wonder you look so bright.

544
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:39,568
Are you that happy just
thinking about baseball?

545
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,662
Yes, I am. I'm so happy.

546
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:42,653
Good.

547
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:45,462
Since you made up your mind,
why don't you make it to the first...

548
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:46,446
No,

549
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:49,646
-make it to the major league.
-Thanks, I will try my best.

550
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:55,953
-Yuri, why aren't you eating?
-What? Well...

551
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:56,955
I don't know.

552
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,152
I don't feel so good today.

553
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,841
I think I have a fever too.

554
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:03,055
I feel chilly, maybe I might have a cold.

555
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:04,538
Really?

556
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,333
-Let's head to the hospital.
-No.

557
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:07,636
I think I'll feel better
after taking medicine.

558
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,435
What are you talking about? Don't you
know how dangerous cold is these days?

559
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,439
Let's get ready and go to the hospital.
Come one, get up.

560
00:26:12,526 --> 00:26:14,534
-I think I'm fine.
-Be careful.

561
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,947
-Can you walk?
-Yes.

562
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:18,137
Gee, I'm so worried.

563
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,624
-Why is he overreacting?
-Tell me about it.

564
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,845
Don't you think they seem
kind of fishy lately?

565
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:27,061
-Did they fall in love, while working?
-What?

566
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:28,555
Kibong and my sister?

567
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:29,752
Are you crazy?

568
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,053
How can you say such horrible thing?

569
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,057
I was just joking.

570
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,041
-Excuse me.
-Hello.

571
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,137
Do you need something?

572
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:41,355
My wallet has gone missing from my room.

573
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:42,042
Pardon?

574
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,244
I had it before I go to bed.

575
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:46,451
But it was gone, when I woke up.

576
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:48,760
Really? What should I do?

577
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:55,717
When was the last time
you saw your wallet?

578
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:57,804
I think around 11PM, last night.

579
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,597
Okay, then.
I will start searching after that time.

580
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,476
That's Kibong and Yuri.

581
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,942
What?

582
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:16,554
What are they talking about so long?

583
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:21,160
Why are they holding hands?

584
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:27,865
"Hall way, second floor"

585
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,058
What's going on?

586
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,166
What the heck is he doing with my sister?

587
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:37,049
I think they are kissing!

588
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,049
Kiss?

589
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,495
Guys, we will go to hospital.

590
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,995
What?

591
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,193
Why are you looking at me like that?

592
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:54,393
You...

593
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:55,901
You...

594
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:57,806
You...

595
00:27:58,105 --> 00:27:59,403
How could you...

596
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,076
What are you saying? What's going on?

597
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:10,669
Hey, Kook Kibong.

598
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:12,772
Explain what happened.

599
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:16,375
I said, explain what did just happen!

600
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,486
Wooshik, calm down.

601
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:20,969
Quiet,

602
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:22,176
and tell me right now.

603
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:24,079
I said, tell me right now!

604
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,078
Brother,

605
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,768
calm down.

606
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:34,779
Okay, I will tell you the truth.

607
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:37,262
Kibong and I...

608
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,449
...are in relationship.

609
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:41,839
So we kissed a little.

610
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:43,951
-Is it wrong?
-What did you say?

611
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:46,644
So you two are really in a relationship?

612
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,049
Sorry for not telling you, Wooshik.

613
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:56,056
Hit me if you want.

614
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:57,770
I will get punched all you like.

615
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,770
But I can never give up Yuri,

616
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,171
just so you know.

617
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:03,862
Hit me,

618
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,568
until you are no longer mad.

619
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,771
No, no...

620
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:16,066
Brother!

621
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:27,072
Thanks, buddy.

622
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:29,072
Thank you so much.

623
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:29,975
What?

624
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:33,477
Thank me?

625
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,465
-Then you'll approve us?
-Of course.

626
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:38,775
You are meeting someone like Yuri.

627
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,654
Of course, I thank you.

628
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:43,360
What?

629
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:46,141
I was wondering how long I have to
take responsibility of this brat,

630
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:47,943
and it always made me upset.

631
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:48,734
But,

632
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:50,542
you have taken care of my worries.

633
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,338
Thank you, my friend.

634
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,730
What did you say?

635
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:54,740
Brother,

636
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,740
-you are being too much!
-No, I'm not.

637
00:29:57,835 --> 00:30:00,636
A pure man like Kibong is
dating a person like you.

638
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,535
I'm so grateful,
and I feel like I owe him a bow.

639
00:30:03,646 --> 00:30:05,240
-Shall I bow?
-No, it's okay.

640
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:08,233
Hey brother, how could you say...

641
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:12,629
-I feel so dizzy.
-Yuri!

642
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:25,141
Kibong.

643
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:27,857
Are you okay, Yuri?

644
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:29,141
Yes.

645
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:31,466
What happened to me?

646
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,451
I don't know.

647
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:34,855
Wooshik went to talk to the doctor.

648
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:36,742
Pardon?

649
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:39,485
-What did you say?
-She's pregnant.

650
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:42,390
-Ms. Cha is pregnant.
-Pregnant...

651
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:45,597
Pregnant? That means, she got...

652
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:48,496
-...a baby inside?
-Yes.

653
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:58,722
Still,

654
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:01,310
since Wooshik has approved,

655
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:03,411
we are able to date
around comfortably, right?

656
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:04,497
Yes.

657
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,282
I thought,
Wooshik would beat me up till death.

658
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:10,393
If I knew, I would have told him sooner.

659
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:13,382
Gee, I was so worried.

660
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,406
You are here. What did he say?

661
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,725
-How long have you guys been going out?
-What?

662
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:32,605
-Why are you asking...
-Just answer me right now.

663
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:34,903
You are scaring me.

664
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:38,290
How can you laugh in front of my
face, you jerk?

665
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,894
-What's wrong, Wooshik?
-How could you say...

666
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,172
You really don't know, you punk?

667
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:46,590
How could you do that to my sister?
How could you?

668
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:47,368
-Die!
-What's wrong?

669
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:49,066
-Brother!
-Die!

670
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,168
Oh, my back!

671
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,381
Wooshik, what's with you?

672
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:56,751
Stop.

673
00:31:57,555 --> 00:31:58,347
Blood!

674
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:00,671
-Wooshik!
-No!

675
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,163
No!

676
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:04,559
Die!

677
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:06,759
Brother in law!

678
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:09,345
Brother in law?

679
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:11,052
Brother in law?

680
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:13,044
Come here.

681
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,994
♪ It's Gi!

682
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,345
Gi! There you go.

683
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:37,758
Here you are.

684
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,540
Thank you.

685
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:40,839
Good bye.

686
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:43,821
Hey,

687
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,028
can you please shorten your autograph?

688
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:47,830
You are making me tired as well.

689
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:50,317
-But I did shorten it.
-Really?

690
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:53,732
If you don't want to lose your remaining
fans, you should shorten it more.

691
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:56,022
I will think about it, sir!

692
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:00,117
Excuse me.

693
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:00,816
Mr. Lee Jungi?

694
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,706
Can we talk for a moment?

695
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,603
-Do you want my autograph?
-No, no. It's fine.

696
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:06,325
No thank you.

697
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,205
Then, what brings you here?

698
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:14,107
-I'm film director, Park Inha.
-Yes, hello.

699
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:16,686
I'm going to produce a film,

700
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:18,789
and I would like to work with you.

701
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:19,589
Pardon?

702
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,787
-With me?
-Yes.

703
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,469
It's a small independent film.

704
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:26,865
You are the image that I
had in mind for main character.

705
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:28,674
And I like your acting.

706
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:30,992
Did you say main character?

707
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:35,471
Kook Kibong,

708
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:36,866
what are you going to do?

709
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,186
What are you going do with my sister?

710
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:45,979
Why aren't you saying anything?

711
00:33:46,078 --> 00:33:47,657
Why aren't you saying anything, I said!

712
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:48,836
Brother,

713
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,034
-stop and calm down yourself.
-What?

714
00:33:51,234 --> 00:33:53,543
-How can I be calm down?
-Cha Wooshik!

715
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:55,534
Shut your mouth up.

716
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:00,868
Kibong,

717
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:02,493
get up.

718
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:04,876
It isn't your fault.

719
00:34:06,431 --> 00:34:08,549
I have no plan to pressure you,

720
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,032
so don't worry.

721
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:12,731
Okay?

722
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:19,751
Yuri.

723
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:26,954
-Why?
-Hold on for a while.

724
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,967
-What? What's with him?
-I don't know.

725
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,933
Yuri,

726
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:46,124
marry me.

727
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,330
What?

728
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:51,334
Even though I'm dumb,

729
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,445
immature,

730
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,428
have no future,

731
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,576
and have nothing I can do well,

732
00:34:58,577 --> 00:35:00,170
but I will make you happy forever.

733
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:02,162
I really can do that well.

734
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:04,375
Kibong...

735
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:13,120
This is a ring that I got when I won for
national high school baseball tournament.

736
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,422
This is all I have for now,

737
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,311
but I will work hard,

738
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:19,618
and make you wear...

739
00:35:19,735 --> 00:35:21,443
...pretty rings on your 10 fingers.

740
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,930
Cha Yuri,

741
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:27,636
will you marry me?

742
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:46,503
Kibong.

743
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,093
Then, you will marry me?

744
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:58,622
Yes.

745
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:02,605
Thanks, Yuri.

746
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:05,019
I will make you happy.

747
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:18,831
"Waikiki Guest House"

748
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:24,220
Can't believe Yuri and
Kibong are getting married...

749
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,711
Unbelievable.

750
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:29,610
-Look, big news. Big news!
-Jungi, big news. Big news!

751
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:30,405
What?

752
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:32,223
What big news?

753
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,215
Something happened to you too?

754
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:36,310
Yuri and Kibong are dating.

755
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:38,906
-What?
-I'm not done yet!

756
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:42,216
-Yuri has Kibong's baby insider her!
-What?

757
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:43,819
It's still not done.

758
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:46,935
Yuri and Kibong are getting married!

759
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,415
What?

760
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,425
-Is that true?
-Yes, it is!

761
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:54,763
-Kibong just proposed to her!
-Propo...

762
00:36:55,707 --> 00:36:58,103
-How can this happen all of sudden?
-I know right?

763
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,305
-What's your big news?
-What?

764
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:05,907
Actually I... Don't want to tell.

765
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,414
It's nothing compared to
Kibong's, so I can't say.

766
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,510
Come on! Tell me what is it about.

767
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,096
Actually,

768
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:17,601
I got a lead role in movie.

769
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:18,792
A lead role?

770
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:20,894
-Really?
-Yes!

771
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:21,790
Well, it's...

772
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,402
...a small independent film, though.

773
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:26,603
That's really great!

774
00:37:26,688 --> 00:37:27,500
Congratulations!

775
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,788
Hey,

776
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:32,191
are you going to congratulate
me without a gift?

777
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:34,199
Buy me a drink!

778
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,277
A drink?

779
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:38,188
But I need to go out for a date.

780
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:39,483
What?

781
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:41,882
Hey.

782
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,199
Your best friend got a lead
role first in his life,

783
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,286
and you want to go out on date
without buying me a drink?

784
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:50,000
Well, I have no choice.
I made plans with him first.

785
00:37:50,097 --> 00:37:51,692
Let's have a drink, when I'm back.

786
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:52,897
Hey, hey.

787
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,691
Do you really have to go?

788
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:56,897
You can go on a date some other time.

789
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,184
I will be back soon.

790
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:00,183
-Let me go first.
-Hey.

791
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,159
Hang out with me.

792
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:02,856
Please?

793
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,667
Hang out with me today.

794
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:08,461
Hang out with me too.

795
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:11,759
Minjun will be here soon.

796
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:14,655
Fine, just go!

797
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:16,042
You are being so cheap.

798
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,351
You are not even my best friend, got it?

799
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,058
Don't be sulky like a kid.

800
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,257
I will be back, alright?

801
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:23,050
Hey, hey. Jeongeun...

802
00:38:23,638 --> 00:38:25,042
I told you to go, but how could you...

803
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:26,051
She's gone.

804
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:31,962
Okay.

805
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:35,451
He's more important than me,
her best friend of 10 years.

806
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:38,742
Such a mean brat.

807
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,339
What are you doing alone pitifully?

808
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:48,018
What are you doing?

809
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:49,605
You said, you are going for a date.
Why did you come back?

810
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:51,009
I canceled it.

811
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:51,919
What?

812
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:53,501
Why would you?

813
00:38:57,897 --> 00:39:00,787
Because I knew you would be like this.

814
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:02,398
But if I get dumped,

815
00:39:02,585 --> 00:39:05,191
you need to take
responsibility of me, okay?

816
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:07,315
Okay.

817
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:10,912
What is there not to?

818
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,324
Are you being serious?

819
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:15,125
Don't change your words later.

820
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:21,612
Shall we toast?

821
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:22,414
Sure.

822
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:34,881
What's going on?

823
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:38,774
-What are you guys drinking for?
-It's to celebrate.

824
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,782
Celebrate?

825
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:43,966
-Jungi got a lead role in a movie.
-Really?

826
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:46,565
-Congratulations, Jungi!
-Thank you.

827
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:47,668
Suyeon,

828
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:48,978
would you like to join us?

829
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,875
No, it's okay.
I have a lot of things to do.

830
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:52,184
You guys enjoy.

831
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,884
Jungi, can you give power bank back to me?

832
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,270
I have to use it tomorrow.

833
00:39:57,373 --> 00:39:58,958
It's on my desk. I will bring it to you.

834
00:39:59,054 --> 00:40:00,751
It's okay. I will go and take it.

835
00:40:14,655 --> 00:40:15,868
"One more minute"

836
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:17,470
"One more minute".

837
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:23,365
It must be the song, Wooshik composed.

838
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:44,188
-Did Wooshik like Suyeon that much?
-Wooshik...

839
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:47,676
...only liked Suyeon since high school.

840
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:49,875
Shall I practice this song,

841
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,284
and sing it for later on?

842
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:52,473
Really?

843
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:54,073
You promised!

844
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,389
Cheer up.

845
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,091
You have us on your side.

846
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:03,600
So...

847
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,393
...if you're ever stressed or exhausted,

848
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:07,675
depend on us anytime.

849
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,703
I told you, I'm okay. What's with you?

850
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:21,005
-Who do you think you are?
-Because I like you.

851
00:41:21,211 --> 00:41:24,101
That's why I can't stop
caring and worrying about you.

852
00:41:44,923 --> 00:41:45,810
Of course,

853
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,727
we are just friends.

854
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,321
Suyeon, don't worry about me.
I'm really okay.

855
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,698
Have you found it yet, Suyeon?

856
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:00,809
It's in the drawer.

857
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:02,587
Here it is.

858
00:42:04,113 --> 00:42:04,916
Hey. What...

859
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,519
Are you crying?

860
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:09,608
Where is Wooshik right now, Jungi?

861
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:11,718
He said, he is going to recording studio.

862
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:14,818
Hey, your power bank...

863
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:18,109
"Waikiki Guest House"

864
00:43:08,776 --> 00:43:10,267
What are you doing?

865
00:43:10,597 --> 00:43:12,068
Why not me?

866
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:16,078
-What don't you like about me.
-I told you, it's not about that.

867
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:17,474
Then what?

868
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:19,371
What's the reason?

869
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,230
I...

870
00:43:22,938 --> 00:43:23,937
Actually,

871
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,540
I have feelings for someone else.

872
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:27,938
Who?

873
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,231
Is it...

874
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:33,327
-...Suyeon?
-Yes.

875
00:43:34,638 --> 00:43:36,638
It has been Suyeon
from the beginning,

876
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,843
and it will be Suyeon always.

877
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:42,239
I'm sorry.

878
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,787
"Waikiki Guest House"

879
00:43:59,573 --> 00:44:00,783
Hey, Suyeon!

880
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:04,874
Hey, Wooshik.

881
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,629
Where did you go?

882
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:11,026
-I just had some business to do.
-I see.

883
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:13,423
What's up with your mood?

884
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:14,910
Did something happen?

885
00:44:16,713 --> 00:44:18,220
No, it's nothing.

886
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:19,704
That's a relief.

887
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:21,513
Let's go in.

888
00:44:21,888 --> 00:44:22,998
Suyeon.

889
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,396
-Dad.
-Suyeon.

890
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:29,902
Dad!

891
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:33,006
Where have you been?

892
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,717
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

893
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:37,309
I'm sorry, Suyeon.

894
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,309
I'm really sorry,

895
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:41,403
Suyeon.

896
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:58,418
Thank you for taking good care of Suyeon.

897
00:44:58,523 --> 00:45:01,142
I don't know how I should thank you.

898
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,194
Don't mention it. It's fine, sir.

899
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:06,383
Still, I would like to
repay your kindness.

900
00:45:08,694 --> 00:45:10,082
This is...

901
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:12,253
...my small appreciation.

902
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:14,564
-Please accept.
-No, no.

903
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:17,658
No, no. Please don't do this, sir.

904
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:19,675
I should do this...

905
00:45:19,762 --> 00:45:21,762
...to make myself at ease.

906
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,242
So please do accept it.

907
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:26,854
Gosh, you didn't have to do this.

908
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:29,971
You really don't have to do this. Gee...

909
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:33,550
It's an ice cream cake coupon.

910
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:35,857
Well...

911
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,746
My situation is still not well,

912
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:40,857
so I couldn't prepare anything more.

913
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:43,968
But everyone says, it's really tasty.

914
00:45:44,364 --> 00:45:46,261
Give it a try later, okay?

915
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,364
Yes, yes. Thank you, sir.

916
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:52,156
Suyeon, go pack your things first.

917
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:54,165
Why do I have to pack?

918
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,196
Well.. I just got to
get back on my feet...

919
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:58,582
...after being conned.

920
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,195
I just managed to...

921
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,562
...start a small business
with my friend in America.

922
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,464
Really?

923
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:06,475
So you should come.

924
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:09,664
Study what you like and stay with me.

925
00:46:10,806 --> 00:46:13,718
The flight is tomorrow afternoon,
so get things packed first.

926
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:15,908
-I've booked a hotel.
-Right now?

927
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:19,925
We can't cause more
trouble to your friends.

928
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,630
No,

929
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:21,615
it's okay.

930
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,115
We are fine. You can just stay here.

931
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:26,613
I don't want to cause trouble anymore.

932
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,311
It's not troubling us at all.

933
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:31,396
If you leave like this,
it will only make us feel uncomfortable.

934
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:33,197
Just stay here. Please?

935
00:46:40,488 --> 00:46:42,177
It's been hard for you, right?

936
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:46,975
No, my friend helped me, so I was fine.

937
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:48,871
Good to hear that.

938
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:50,869
Well...

939
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:52,466
By the way, dad.

940
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:54,188
Do I really have to go?

941
00:46:54,282 --> 00:46:55,965
What are you talking about?

942
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:57,373
The thing is...

943
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,873
...I have my career here.

944
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:01,459
-Career?
-Yes.

945
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:04,459
-I'm working as a reporter.
-Suyeon.

946
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:05,364
You no longer...

947
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:06,878
...need to work.

948
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:08,770
No, it's something I like to do.

949
00:47:08,874 --> 00:47:10,467
If you really want to do,

950
00:47:10,575 --> 00:47:12,170
you can do it in America.

951
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:15,358
-But still...
-Then you want to live...

952
00:47:15,558 --> 00:47:17,160
...away from me again?

953
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:20,157
-No, it's not like that...
-Then, just listen to me.

954
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,254
I will never...

955
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:23,944
...leave you alone again.

956
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:30,723
-Is Suyeon really leaving?
-I guess...

957
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:33,343
I didn't expect her to leave so sudden.

958
00:47:34,439 --> 00:47:35,334
Right,

959
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,033
what happened to you and Minah?

960
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:38,829
Are you going to accept her heart?

961
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,032
No,

962
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:41,722
-I rejected her.
-What?

963
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,419
Why did you?

964
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:46,643
Tell me honestly.

965
00:47:47,135 --> 00:47:48,840
You still have feelings for Suyeon, right?

966
00:47:51,556 --> 00:47:53,159
Gee, I knew it.

967
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:54,564
What are you going to do?

968
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:56,054
Are you just going to let her go?

969
00:47:56,262 --> 00:47:57,754
I have no choice.

970
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:02,457
It's been so hard for her. She can
get to study what she likes in America,

971
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:04,853
and her father is next to her.

972
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,554
-It's a good thing for her.
-Hey.

973
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:09,546
-Still, we can't just let her go...
-It's okay.

974
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:11,227
It doesn't matter to me,

975
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:15,230
as long as she's happy.

976
00:48:15,728 --> 00:48:18,426
So don't say a word to her.

977
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:20,741
If you guys tell something to her,

978
00:48:21,137 --> 00:48:22,929
I will get really mad.

979
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:24,033
Got it?

980
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:45,019
Suyeon, what are you doing here?

981
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,129
Nothing. I just couldn't sleep.

982
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,915
Why did you come out?

983
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:53,107
I couldn't sleep either.

984
00:48:55,212 --> 00:48:56,616
Is your father sleeping?

985
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,820
Yes.

986
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,871
Today is the last night,

987
00:49:02,979 --> 00:49:04,377
you will spend here.

988
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:08,056
It feels like yesterday that we met again.

989
00:49:08,564 --> 00:49:10,253
Time goes so fast.

990
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,266
Right?

991
00:49:14,163 --> 00:49:14,963
Right.

992
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:21,550
Thanks for everything, Wooshik.

993
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,620
What are you talking about?

994
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:28,143
I haven't done anything for you.

995
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,420
No.

996
00:49:30,438 --> 00:49:34,125
I'm grateful for everything,
you've done for me.

997
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:38,278
Don't mention it.

998
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,278
We are friends after all.

999
00:49:46,729 --> 00:49:47,529
That's right.

1000
00:49:50,038 --> 00:49:52,038
We are friends. Friends...

1001
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:02,904
You need to get up early, Suyeon.

1002
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:05,093
-Why don't you go back to your bed?
-Okay.

1003
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:07,687
You go back first.
I will stay here a bit longer.

1004
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:09,394
Sure.

1005
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:13,881
Wait, Wooshik.

1006
00:50:14,994 --> 00:50:15,794
Yes.

1007
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:16,700
What's up?

1008
00:50:23,022 --> 00:50:25,133
No, it's nothing.

1009
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:30,934
I wanted to say good night.

1010
00:50:33,745 --> 00:50:34,445
I see.

1011
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,054
Good night to you too.

1012
00:51:19,483 --> 00:51:22,083
"Waikiki Guest House"

1013
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,190
Thanks for...

1014
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:27,072
...everything, you guys.

1015
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,071
I will never forget about you.

1016
00:51:29,172 --> 00:51:32,878
Gee, it's not like we'll never see
each other again in this high-tech age.

1017
00:51:32,982 --> 00:51:33,973
She's right.

1018
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:36,585
Let's not do hokey farewell with cry.

1019
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,685
It doesn't suit us.

1020
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:39,377
Don't you dare cry!

1021
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:41,484
Okay, I won't.

1022
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,476
It's a farewell to Rebecca as well.

1023
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:47,947
What would happen,

1024
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:50,750
if I didn't hide in
the trunk of Rebecca...

1025
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:53,544
...to run away from my wedding?

1026
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,641
What else?

1027
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:57,171
You would have been happier,
not sufferring from us.

1028
00:51:57,836 --> 00:51:58,644
No.

1029
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:02,150
It was lucky for me to hide inside it.

1030
00:52:03,055 --> 00:52:05,855
It's the best thing that
I've done in my life.

1031
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:07,725
Hey guys,

1032
00:52:08,127 --> 00:52:10,420
farewell should be short and impactive.

1033
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:13,118
Your father is waiting.
You should go, Suyeon.

1034
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:14,824
Okay, I will go now.

1035
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:19,894
Wooshik, I will go now.

1036
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:22,394
Send me once your album gets released.

1037
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:23,799
Okay.

1038
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:25,669
Sure.

1039
00:52:26,774 --> 00:52:27,574
Good bye.

1040
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:34,777
I will really go now, then.

1041
00:53:23,356 --> 00:53:26,352
It feels so empty without Suyeon, right?

1042
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:28,971
How can one person make such a difference?

1043
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:31,264
I wonder if she has
arrived at the airport.

1044
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,467
I guess so.

1045
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:34,563
There's only an hour for her to depart.

1046
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:36,069
Wooshik,

1047
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:38,792
-you really are okay. Right?
-What?

1048
00:53:40,188 --> 00:53:42,188
I said, I'm okay.

1049
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,076
I'm really fine. Don't mind me.

1050
00:53:47,879 --> 00:53:50,182
-Sir.
-What brings you here, Minah?

1051
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:52,773
I got a broken heart and you
didn't even buy me a drink.

1052
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:55,171
So I've come to ask you for a drink.

1053
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,067
What?

1054
00:53:58,172 --> 00:54:00,262
What's wrong with the mood in here?

1055
00:54:00,366 --> 00:54:01,080
Because...

1056
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:02,881
...Suyeon just left.

1057
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:04,969
Left? To where?

1058
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,969
-She left to America with her father.
-Sorry?

1059
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,879
And you just let her leave?

1060
00:54:11,974 --> 00:54:14,661
You told me,
you still have feelings for her!

1061
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,358
That's just my one sided feeling.

1062
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:19,349
What?

1063
00:54:19,758 --> 00:54:22,556
Don't tell me, you still don't know.

1064
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:26,261
-What do you mean?
-Don't you know that Suyeon likes you?

1065
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:26,859
What?

1066
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:29,054
What do you mean she likes me?

1067
00:54:29,555 --> 00:54:31,475
You are so clueless.

1068
00:54:31,552 --> 00:54:33,552
-How could you not know?
-Gee,

1069
00:54:33,663 --> 00:54:35,266
how do you know something
that I don't even know?

1070
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,552
Why don't you know?

1071
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:40,649
How can you not know when she came
all the way to ER, when you fainted.

1072
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:42,851
She looks even more shocked than me.

1073
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:44,850
I knew it with just one glance.

1074
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:48,330
It's because she was shocked
to hear that I was fainted.

1075
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,717
Wait, wait.

1076
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:53,726
That's why she was crying that time.

1077
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,844
-Cried? What do you mean?
-I mean,

1078
00:54:55,931 --> 00:54:58,431
she was crying while listing
to your song yesterday.

1079
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:01,130
So she went out hurriedly
to say something to you.

1080
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,424
I now understand why she did it.

1081
00:55:03,518 --> 00:55:04,406
What?

1082
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:06,509
Why are you telling me that now?

1083
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,714
I thought she went out
to compliment your song.

1084
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,423
Why did she just go
without saying anything?

1085
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,423
-It's weird.
-There is no time to think about that now!

1086
00:55:16,527 --> 00:55:18,836
-Call her now.
-Okay.

1087
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:24,638
The phone is turned off...

1088
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:25,724
Gosh.

1089
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,716
Her phone is off. What should I do?

1090
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,224
There's still time until her departure,

1091
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:32,240
-so go to airport now.
-Okay, I will.

1092
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,138
-I will go now.
-Hold on.

1093
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,455
Take this with you.

1094
00:55:36,944 --> 00:55:37,947
What?

1095
00:55:38,249 --> 00:55:40,455
-You want me to take Rebecca?
-Of course.

1096
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:42,543
Trust Rebecca.

1097
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:43,852
Go now.

1098
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:46,638
Go and get her!

1099
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:48,850
Okay, I will!

1100
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:55,677
What is this?

1101
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:58,987
How can it not go higher than 20km/h?
What kind of crappy car is this?

1102
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:01,582
Rebecca, get yourself together.

1103
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,360
And stop playing this song, please!

1104
00:56:06,956 --> 00:56:07,856
What's wrong with this?

1105
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:13,346
What the heck?

1106
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:15,147
No!

1107
00:56:16,236 --> 00:56:17,251
No!

1108
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,230
No, Rebecca!

1109
00:56:23,938 --> 00:56:24,930
No...

1110
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:29,140
No, Rebecca!

1111
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:32,036
No!

1112
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:36,942
No!

1113
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,953
Geez...

1114
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,367
How could this happen?

1115
00:56:50,947 --> 00:56:53,548
Everyone makes it to the
airport in movies or dramas.

1116
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,060
I didn't even get near to the airport.

1117
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:58,465
What the heck is this?

1118
00:56:58,759 --> 00:57:01,861
I'm the crazy jerk who took Rebecca.

1119
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,403
Hotteok? Hotteok sounds good!
Let's go, Wooshik.

1120
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:16,910
Can we get two hotteoks, please?

1121
00:57:17,006 --> 00:57:19,504
Wooshik, make it three. I want two!

1122
00:57:20,212 --> 00:57:23,308
Your girlfriend seems to like hotteok.

1123
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,812
Let's get two hotteoks, two!

1124
00:57:28,106 --> 00:57:31,303
I think I will feel better,
if I get one more hotteok.

1125
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:40,877
"Honey Hotteok"

1126
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:42,271
-Hello.
-Hey.

1127
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,861
-Can you give me one hotteok?
-Give me a moment.

1128
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:49,096
-Here you go.
-Yes.

1129
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:50,964
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1130
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,190
-Can I get one too?
-Sure.

1131
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:25,983
What?

1132
00:58:27,786 --> 00:58:28,697
Suyeon.

1133
00:58:29,346 --> 00:58:30,448
What happened to you?

1134
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,146
It just happened.

1135
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:36,052
Here you go.

1136
00:58:36,148 --> 00:58:37,638
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1137
00:58:39,118 --> 00:58:41,427
What are you doing here, eating hotteok?

1138
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:43,943
And why didn't you bring your phone?

1139
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:46,744
Do you know how long I
waited at the airport?

1140
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:49,234
Rebecca broke down...

1141
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,487
You waited for me?

1142
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,325
Why?

1143
00:58:56,838 --> 00:58:58,730
I heard, you still have feelings for me.

1144
00:58:59,422 --> 00:59:00,035
What?

1145
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,650
How... How did you know?

1146
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:04,942
Just...

1147
00:59:05,657 --> 00:59:08,054
I left something behind,

1148
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,491
so I called the guest
house and they told me.

1149
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:12,646
Then,

1150
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,640
-you came back for me?
-No.

1151
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:19,332
Come to think of it,

1152
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,651
I even have a new segment under my name.

1153
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,543
And just leaving it will be a waste.

1154
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,526
I felt irresponsible too.

1155
00:59:27,328 --> 00:59:28,732
If I go to America,

1156
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:30,625
I won't get to eat delicious hotteok.

1157
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,315
I see...

1158
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:36,018
And more importantly,

1159
00:59:36,605 --> 00:59:38,708
the person I like is here.

1160
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:43,327
-The person you like?
-Yes.

1161
00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:45,535
I...

1162
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:55,293
...like my guest house mates so much!

1163
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:01,181
I see...

1164
01:00:04,006 --> 01:00:04,706
Well,

1165
01:00:04,814 --> 01:00:07,798
I have someone I like especially.

1166
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:11,597
Who?

1167
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:15,794
Well...

1168
01:00:17,103 --> 01:00:18,197
Who do you think it is?

1169
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:26,118
-Wooshik, hold this for a while.
-Yes? Sure.

1170
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,340
What do you think?

1171
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:29,051
It's neat inside and has great interior.
Isn't it nice?

1172
01:01:29,136 --> 01:01:31,040
On top of that,
this is such a good location,

1173
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:33,748
and everyone who lived
here became successful.

1174
01:01:33,828 --> 01:01:35,946
-Really?
-Yes!

1175
01:01:36,034 --> 01:01:37,032
Look over there!

1176
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:40,339
Shiva Wooshik, a famous singer,

1177
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:42,148
an awarded actor,

1178
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:44,045
king of home run, baseball player,

1179
01:01:44,141 --> 01:01:46,298
popular reporter,

1180
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,911
CEO of famous chain restaurant,

1181
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:49,917
and lastly...

1182
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:54,108
actress and advertisement model
who is popular as a scene stealer.

1183
01:01:54,203 --> 01:01:56,618
Everyone became successful!

1184
01:01:56,698 --> 01:01:57,496
Really?

1185
01:01:57,604 --> 01:01:59,316
But I've never seen them before.

1186
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:02,101
They are all working in overseas.

1187
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:04,897
They are all famous outside of Korea.
You didn't know?

1188
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:06,588
Then, shall we...

1189
01:02:06,696 --> 01:02:07,899
...sign the contract?

1190
01:02:08,201 --> 01:02:09,891
I'm not so sure...

1191
01:02:09,979 --> 01:02:10,788
I would like to think about it more.

1192
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:13,487
What is there to think about?

1193
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:15,081
If you signed the contract with me,

1194
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:18,170
I will give you that
long pipe as a present.

1195
01:02:18,273 --> 01:02:19,169
Pardon?

1196
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,381
I don't need it.

1197
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:22,472
I will think about it for
a few days and give you a call.

1198
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:23,764
Then, good bye.

1199
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:26,366
There is no pipe longer than that one.

1200
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:30,071
That is so long. The longest in the world!

1201
01:02:31,172 --> 01:02:32,773
Darn it!

1202
01:02:48,175 --> 01:02:49,270
How did it go?

1203
01:02:49,355 --> 01:02:51,365
He wants to think about
it for a few days as well.

1204
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,269
Does he think he's "The Thinker" by Rodin?

1205
01:02:53,365 --> 01:02:55,476
I told you this way won't work.

1206
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,970
Who believes in this obvious lie?

1207
01:02:58,064 --> 01:02:59,468
Are you all fools?

1208
01:02:59,762 --> 01:03:03,158
Gee, you only sold 20 albums and what?

1209
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:05,417
A famous singer? Gosh.

1210
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:07,727
But I sold more than your
audiences for your movie!

1211
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:10,314
You are just a lead role of movie
that was watched by seventeen people only!

1212
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:12,699
No, among five of them is us.

1213
01:03:12,804 --> 01:03:15,693
Rest two is his parents. So it's ten. Ten!

1214
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:16,523
Gosh.

1215
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:17,208
Hey,

1216
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,015
but I still have seventeen more people
than the member of your baseball club.

1217
01:03:20,111 --> 01:03:22,111
You only have three members!

1218
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:24,910
No, it's not.
One left yesterday, so I now have two!

1219
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,299
Oh, really? Go ahead and brag about it.

1220
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,798
That's what I'm saying it.
You have no right to laugh at us!

1221
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,107
It's okay, Kibong.

1222
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:37,295
We grow up twice bigger than last year.

1223
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:39,406
By the way, this little...

1224
01:03:39,494 --> 01:03:41,604
Why are you belittle him
in front of Secheong?

1225
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,299
These are such bunch of...

1226
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:45,205
Why are you getting mad at Wooshik?

1227
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:48,014
Kibong made fun of Jungi too!

1228
01:03:48,104 --> 01:03:49,713
You are being mean.

1229
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:53,585
-Do you guys want a showdown as couples?
-Quiet!

1230
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,595
I'm going crazy.

1231
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,600
What have I done so wrong in the past?

1232
01:03:57,691 --> 01:04:01,108
Why do I always get these
kinds of tenants? Why?

1233
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,864
Excuse me, ma'am. Maybe you've
done terrible thing in the past.

1234
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:08,069
-Perhaps you sold the country.
-That makes sense.

1235
01:04:08,467 --> 01:04:10,967
And that being said,
would you please lower our rent...

1236
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:12,683
...as a way of repenting your sin?

1237
01:04:13,064 --> 01:04:14,570
Even better, if there is no rent.

1238
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:16,175
That sounds good. Nice!

1239
01:04:16,468 --> 01:04:19,268
These little punks...

1240
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:20,854
You all...

1241
01:04:21,073 --> 01:04:23,147
...are dead meat to me.

1242
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:26,838
Ma'am!

1243
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:28,940
Ma'am!

1244
01:04:50,618 --> 01:04:54,332
"Waikiki"
