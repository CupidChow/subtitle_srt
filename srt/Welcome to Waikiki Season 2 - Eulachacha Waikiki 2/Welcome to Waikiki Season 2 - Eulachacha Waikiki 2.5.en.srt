"100 Real Dating Skills"

2
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,524
No. That's not how you fight!

3
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,170
-Come on.
-This is frustrating.

4
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,724
He needs to use an arm-bar!

5
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:10,309
No, he needs to roll over,
get into a full mount position...

6
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,585
...and pound him down.

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,699
No, if he fails, he'll get locked
in a triangle choke.

8
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:17,598
I can't read because of
you two being so noisy!

9
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:20,350
Why do men find that so entertaining?

10
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:22,602
What? Ramming, falling,
rolling, dodging, and hitting.

11
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:24,144
It's so fun.

12
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:28,672
And there's something about
martial arts that makes men's blood boil.

13
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,544
Darn it! Dude, that was awesome!

14
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:34,569
Back spin elbow!

15
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:37,092
I didn't expect him to use
a back spin elbow like that.

16
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:38,804
Back spin elbow? What is that?

17
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,689
That right there.

18
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,534
The spin adds huge power to the move.

19
00:00:44,618 --> 00:00:46,831
And because it uses the elbow...

20
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,917
...one blow is enough
to knock the opponent out.

21
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:53,255
You even know martial arts moves.
That's impressive.

22
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,616
Then you two must be good
at fighting, right?

23
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:57,566
Fighting?

24
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,078
Well, it's not like I'd get
beaten up by anyone.

25
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:05,462
I've never lost a fight either.

26
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:06,444
Really?

27
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,767
Then... who would win
if you two had a fight?

28
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:10,684
Us?

29
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:15,004
I'm just curious. That's all.

30
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:18,879
But looking at the height and
frame, I think Kibong will win.

31
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:19,996
What?

32
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:23,432
Come on, Jungi has
a black belt in Taekwondo.

33
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,341
Maybe Jungi will win.

34
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:27,486
What? That's nonsense.

35
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,241
Look at the size difference.

36
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:31,234
You never know until they fight.

37
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,677
Stop it already.

38
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:36,901
There's no winning or losing
between friends. Come on.

39
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:41,207
But frame is not everything
when it comes to fighting.

40
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:46,808
But you can't completely ignore
the role of physique in fights.

41
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,672
I said, you weren't mistaken.

42
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,769
You were my first love.

43
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:15,008
Cha Wooshik, you were my first love.

44
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:21,072
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

45
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,724
Hey, brother. I'm trying to read.

46
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:26,709
It was me.

47
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,276
What do you mean it was you?

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,879
Suyeon said that her first love...

49
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:33,353
...was me.

50
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,127
What? Really?

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,135
Are you serious?

52
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,471
Yeah. But I misunderstood things...

53
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:43,811
...and made a fool
out of myself for 10 years.

54
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,604
If it weren't for that misunderstanding...

55
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:49,294
...I would've dated Suyeon happily...

56
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,478
...and gotten married.

57
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:55,728
By now, we would have
a son and a daughter...

58
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:58,774
...living a happy life together.

59
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:02,355
My gosh. You made plans to get married...

60
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,967
...and have kids with her on your own?

61
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,645
Then why not give it another shot?

62
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,310
Another shot? How?

63
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:12,274
Suyeon doesn't seem
to be into me anymore.

64
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:13,988
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:16,225
Hey, why would she say
that you were her first love...

66
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,825
...if she's not interested in you?

67
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,421
To correct any misunderstandings.

68
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,659
Right. Why would she do that?

69
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,048
It's been more than 10 years.

70
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,427
Why bother? Why now? For what?

71
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,337
That's because she doesn't
want you to misunderstand.

72
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:32,269
Why? Because she's into you.

73
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,316
Come on. No way.

74
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,667
Wooshik, I have something to tell you.

75
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:45,761
Can we meet at the cafe nearby?

76
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:47,380
Why? What is it?

77
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,587
Suyeon wants to meet.
She has something to say.

78
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:50,511
Something to say?

79
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:53,752
I have a gut feeling.

80
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,825
She's going to ask you out. I'm sure.

81
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,734
-Ask me out?
-She said you're her first love.

82
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:03,130
Why would she ask to meet you
unless she wants to ask you out?

83
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,562
She wants to ask you out.
I'm 100 percent sure.

84
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,433
Trust me, I'm telling you.

85
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:10,817
Really?

86
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,963
Sorry for calling you out all of a sudden.

87
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:25,106
It's okay.

88
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,119
But what is it that you want to tell me?

89
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:30,750
Well...

90
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:34,086
...are you seeing anyone these days?

91
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,004
What?

92
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:36,610
No.

93
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:39,775
Why?

94
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:41,833
That's a relief.

95
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:44,718
Actually...

96
00:04:47,783 --> 00:04:49,956
Hey, Dayeong. Over here.

97
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,270
Hello.

98
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:00,087
Hello. Who is she?

99
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,870
She's my co-worker.

100
00:05:01,954 --> 00:05:04,746
She's lonely lately and asked me
to fix her up with someone.

101
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:06,794
And I immediately thought of you.

102
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,871
I thought you two would be a good pair.

103
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:09,866
What?

104
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:11,733
A blind date?

105
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,223
So the thing she wanted
to talk about was a blind date?

106
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:17,643
Yeah! I was crazy enough
to trust you again.

107
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,920
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

108
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:23,099
A blind date...?

109
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,275
That Suyeon is one wicked girl.

110
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,669
-She's a player.
-Player?

111
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:32,990
She must be testing you.
I'm 100 percent certain.

112
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,299
What?

113
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,173
She's testing me? Why?

114
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:39,863
Jeez, how could you be so clueless?

115
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:44,093
Brother. There are two
types of blind dates.

116
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,689
The ordinary blind date,
and the blind date used as bait.

117
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,962
We need to focus on
the blind date used as bait.

118
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,777
A blind date used as bait? What's that?

119
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:51,953
Let me explain.

120
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,752
Let's say I like this guy.

121
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,438
But I don't know if he likes me or not.

122
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,987
So I set him up on a blind date
out of the blue.

123
00:06:01,072 --> 00:06:02,360
-And?
-And...

124
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,657
...if that guy takes the blind date,
then that means he's not into me.

125
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:09,431
But if he turns it down
for no apparent reason...

126
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,004
...then that means he's into me.

127
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:16,494
It's a very advanced skill that women use
to test the men they like.

128
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:17,917
That's ridiculous.

129
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,642
If you don't believe me...

130
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:22,050
...tell her that you'll meet
that girl from the blind date.

131
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:27,123
Then Suyeon will be so surprised
that she'll try to stop you like crazy.

132
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,572
Forget it. I'm not falling for it again!

133
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,009
Who are you trying to fool?

134
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,154
I can trust you, right?

135
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:33,787
This time I'm 100 percent...

136
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:36,446
...no, I'm 200 percent sure.

137
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,132
Just trust your sister, okay?

138
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:44,514
Whoa, you're all dressed up.
What's the occasion?

139
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,965
What? It's nothing.

140
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,074
-See you.
-Bye.

141
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:49,922
What?

142
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:51,824
Yuri, where is he going?

143
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,355
You don't have to know.

144
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:56,770
You're reeking of sweat!

145
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,532
Do you have to train on a weekend?

146
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:02,448
He never skips a day
of training all year long.

147
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,264
But how come you're
still in the second team?

148
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,450
Once I fully recover from my injury...

149
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:08,418
...I'll be promoted to the first team.

150
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,804
It's hot.

151
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm going to take a shower.

152
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:14,483
Kibong.

153
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,781
Whoa, it's like you're made of rock!

154
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:18,739
But what?

155
00:07:18,823 --> 00:07:21,163
A scrawny guy like Jungi might beat him?

156
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,338
Who knows?

157
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,994
You're being so stubborn.

158
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,574
Kibong, be honest.
You really can't beat Jungi?

159
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,904
There you go again.

160
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:30,106
Why do you want to know so badly?

161
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,512
But, you know...

162
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:36,644
...me and him are
in a different weight class.

163
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,666
Let's say Jungi is
an elementary student...

164
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,331
...then I'm Tyson.

165
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,665
What would happen if
a grade-schooler hit Mike Tyson?

166
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,927
It will only tickle.

167
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,620
But with one blow using my fist, he'll...

168
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,725
...no, just one blow using my knuckles...

169
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:52,212
...I can knock him out.

170
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,695
So in other words, you'll win?

171
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,749
Well, I'm not really saying that I will.

172
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:58,562
Forget it. Just stop.

173
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:01,448
I'm going to take a shower.

174
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,907
What? Kibong said he can beat me?

175
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:08,367
Yeah. He said you're just
a grade-schooler compared to him.

176
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,339
He said it would only tickle
if you hit him...

177
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,118
...and he could knock you
out with his knuckles.

178
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,039
What? Knuckles?

179
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,632
But, Jungi. Is it true
that you'll lose to Kibong?

180
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,858
Hey, why is winning and losing
so important between friends?

181
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,103
My goodness.

182
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:27,774
But you know what?
Big dudes tend to be slow.

183
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:29,863
But I'm quick.

184
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,946
He's strong but so what?
He can't land a single punch on me.

185
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,605
And yeah, he's a big guy.
But it's not like he's made of steel.

186
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,046
If I...

187
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:45,889
...dodge like this and punch
like this and just keep...

188
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,062
...throwing punches,
then it's game over.

189
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,632
Done.

190
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:52,456
So you're saying you'll win?

191
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,521
No, not necessarily. It's just...

192
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:59,350
Gosh, just forget it.
Let's drop this topic.

193
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,188
I should just let it go.

194
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:09,910
Korean pigs' feet boiled for over
10 hours with 20 medicinal herbs.

195
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:12,733
-Welcome to Joahn's Jokbal.
-Sir...

196
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:15,455
-Welcome to Joahn's Jokbal.
-It's really delicious.

197
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,359
Hey, Suyeon. Are you tired?

198
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,393
Here.

199
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:21,929
Thanks.

200
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:24,870
Don't mention it.
You introduced me to Wooshik.

201
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,225
I should thank you.

202
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:29,346
No, I just thought you guys
would be perfect for each other.

203
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:31,755
I'm sorry, Dayeong.

204
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:35,450
"Sorry"?

205
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,230
That's it?

206
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,693
Do you think "sorry" is enough?
You bonehead!

207
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,015
-Dayeong...
-Hey!

208
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,943
Can you not control your limbs?

209
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:47,277
Why are you out working
when you can't even stand on your feet?

210
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:49,837
Just go home and lie down!

211
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,498
I'm sorry, Dayeong.
I'll wipe your shoes for you.

212
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:01,075
Do you think this is about my shoes?

213
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,884
I don't even need these shoes.

214
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:06,650
These shoes...

215
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,777
...I don't need them!

216
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:19,131
So don't ever...

217
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,280
...step on my feet again.

218
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:23,608
Got it?

219
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:26,975
Move!

220
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,297
What's gotten into her?

221
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:37,003
-You didn't know? She's a psycho.
-A psycho?

222
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,501
She's got a nasty temper. It's no joke.

223
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:42,794
When a guy who used to work here
accidentally spat at her while talking...

224
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,960
...she hit him with a microphone
and he was hospitalized.

225
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:45,997
For four weeks.

226
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,314
What? Four weeks?

227
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,349
Did you really set her up on a blind date?

228
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:54,249
Why did you do that?

229
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,406
Hey, Suyeon.

230
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,775
What? Hey, Wooshik.

231
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:02,095
-What brings you here?
-What?

232
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,415
I'm here for a date with Dayeong.

233
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,333
A date?

234
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:09,976
Are you really going to date Dayeong?

235
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,144
Huh? Why?

236
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:15,379
Is there a reason why
I shouldn't date her?

237
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:19,078
-The thing is, Wooshik...
-Wooshik!

238
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,797
What are you doing here
without even contacting me?

239
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:25,207
Well... I came here to see you.

240
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,956
I thought we should grab a beer together.

241
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:31,020
I'll be done soon.
Please wait a little bit.

242
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:33,994
Sure. Hey, weren't you
about to say something?

243
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,113
Why?

244
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,866
Do you have something to say to Wooshik?

245
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:41,055
What?

246
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,109
Well... No, it's nothing.

247
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,439
Nothing, right?

248
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:49,984
Nothing at all.

249
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,374
You must be tired. You should
go home and get some rest.

250
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,292
What?

251
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,240
Well...

252
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:09,630
...I just want some beer too.

253
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:12,337
What's going on?
Why did she follow us here?

254
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,292
How strange.

255
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,202
"Mortal Enemy"

256
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,772
It's my sister. I should take this call.

257
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,327
Hey, sis.

258
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,453
I need to use the washroom.

259
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:25,487
Suyeon?

260
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:29,484
I'm hungry. Can we decide
on the food before you go?

261
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,546
When I'm hungry...

262
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,363
...I get angry.

263
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:39,165
Oh, really?

264
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,056
Let's get fried chicken.

265
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,674
Hey! Don't you know that I'm on a diet?

266
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,604
Are you telling me to eat
fried chicken and get fat?

267
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,741
No, no.

268
00:12:51,257 --> 00:12:52,159
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:55,906
Then...

270
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,539
...should we have salad?

271
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:00,496
Salad is not filling at all.

272
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,982
I said I'm hungry!

273
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,438
Then...

274
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:09,058
What? She followed you guys to drink?

275
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,161
Yes!

276
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:14,196
I told her to go home,
but she insisted on joining us.

277
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:17,422
She's dying to get your attention.

278
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,120
See? I told you Suyeon is
also interested in you.

279
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:22,283
-Really?
-Yes, of course.

280
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,855
How anxious she must be
to follow you guys to the pub?

281
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,016
You really think so?

282
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,911
This one. Sausages...

283
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,867
...and veggie stir-fry?

284
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:44,600
Hey! How many times did I say
that I'm on a diet? You bonehead!

285
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:46,840
You want me to eat sausages and get fat?

286
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:49,749
No, it's not that. You said...

287
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,764
You can eat anything
because you're slim, right?

288
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:58,209
Good for you.

289
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,672
Since I'm a fatty, I'll just eat the menu.

290
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:09,782
It's so delicious!

291
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:12,353
I'm sorry, Dayeong.

292
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,368
So don't ever take this long
when you order food.

293
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:19,661
Got it?

294
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,093
Okay.

295
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:34,969
But, Suyeon has a really
anxious look in her eyes.

296
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:38,186
She's nervous that things might
go well between you and that girl.

297
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,258
But it looks like she's
more than just anxious.

298
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:43,036
Shall I say she looks terrified?

299
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,961
The idea of you dating
that girl must be terrifying for her.

300
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:48,663
Oh, I see.

301
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,120
So Suyeon must have feelings for me too.

302
00:14:57,603 --> 00:14:59,902
What? Jungi said he can beat me?

303
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,566
Yeah. He said he can dodge
all your punches because you're slow.

304
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,247
He said if he dodges like this and
punches like this and...

305
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,219
...then it's game over.

306
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,366
Oh man.

307
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:14,013
Fine, let's say he'll win.

308
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:15,795
I'm tired. I need some rest.

309
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,058
Okay, get some rest.

310
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:20,340
What? I'm slow?

311
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,895
And I can't land a single punch on him?

312
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:25,870
I'm back.

313
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,083
Where have you been?

314
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,751
What? Well...

315
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,411
I went to some film production
companies to drop off my acting CV.

316
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,257
By the way,

317
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:49,283
Jeongeun told me...

318
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,834
that you said you're sure you can beat me.

319
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:53,722
Oh, that.

320
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,368
That wasn't specifically about you.

321
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:00,771
I simply explained to her
that having a big physique...

322
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:02,467
isn't that important in fighting.

323
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,548
That's what it was. I didn't know that.

324
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,692
But I heard you also said
you're sure you can beat me.

325
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:18,316
Didn't you say a knuckle
is enough to knock me out?

326
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:23,846
Well, that wasn't specifically about you.

327
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,541
I just told her...

328
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,720
that having a strong physique
does matter in fighting.

329
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:31,090
That's what I said.

330
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,717
That's what it was.

331
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:35,566
I didn't know that.

332
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:42,838
But, Jungi. Have you ever heard
of this story back in high school?

333
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,572
-No, never.
-Then I should tell you.

334
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:47,724
-What?
-The duel of rice cake skewers.

335
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,419
I was the hero of the story.

336
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:53,139
"The duel of the rice cake skewers"?
It's the first time I'm hearing about it.

337
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:56,966
I guess I should tell you,
just in case you're curious.

338
00:16:57,868 --> 00:17:01,644
The wind was exceptionally cold that day.

339
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:12,754
Wait, that's...

340
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,815
...my best friend, Minguk.

341
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,324
Hey, I'm hungry for some
delicious rice cake skewers.

342
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,219
Why don't you give me some money?

343
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:25,425
Hey.

344
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:33,010
What on earth are you
doing to my best friend...

345
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:34,324
...in broad daylight?

346
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:35,627
Who the hell are you?

347
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:40,237
There's no need for introductions.

348
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:44,111
Let my best friend go...

349
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,247
...while I'm asking nicely.

350
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,199
They say fools rush in
where angels fear to tread.

351
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:51,370
Boys!

352
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:06,065
Look at you vermin flocking together.

353
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,687
Today, I will...

354
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,147
...exterminate you all.

355
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:13,778
Bring it on!

356
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:43,369
Kibong, you saved my life.

357
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:44,669
Thank you so much...

358
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,800
Friends don't thank each other.

359
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,364
Adios for now.

360
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,081
Liar! You expect me to believe that?

361
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,953
Then don't.

362
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,871
But what I'm trying to say here is...

363
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,739
...that I may have a large build...

364
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:07,572
...but I'm surprisingly quick.

365
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:12,090
Those fast Taekwondo athletes
couldn't dodge any of my punches.

366
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:14,685
Fine, whatever. Let's just say it's true.

367
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,913
But now that you mentioned
the old days, I remember something.

368
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,719
Have you ever head of the
legend of 1-on-18?

369
00:19:21,804 --> 00:19:23,954
"Legend of the 1-on-18"?

370
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:28,134
The sky was very high and blue that day.

371
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:35,517
No, please.

372
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:36,942
Hey, kid.

373
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,561
Why don't you hand over
that rare card already?

374
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,039
No. You can't have this.

375
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:49,513
You brat! You just don't listen, do you?

376
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:53,685
Stop it right there.

377
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,688
Who the hell are you?

378
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:01,734
You can call me a human cleaner,
who cleans up human garbage like you.

379
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:03,446
What?

380
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:08,542
You must be looking forward
to your funeral, aren't you?

381
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:14,880
Guys!

382
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,374
Get him!

383
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,108
"Il-Yeong Station"

384
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,606
Liar! 1-on-18, my butt.

385
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,931
Fine. Don't believe me, then. Whatever.

386
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:03,546
But what I'm trying to say is...

387
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:06,939
I may be a small guy,
but I'm surprisingly destructive.

388
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:11,576
Those bulky baseball guys
were knocked out by my punches.

389
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:14,407
Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.

390
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:22,002
Thank you for dinner, Wooshik.

391
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:23,534
Don't mention it.

392
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,257
I forgot my cellphone.

393
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:29,841
Just a minute.

394
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:35,605
Wooshik, I have something to tell you.

395
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:37,168
To me? What is it?

396
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,061
Do you...

397
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,414
...really have to go out with Dayeong?

398
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:44,744
Can you just not go out with her?

399
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:47,033
What? Look at her!

400
00:21:47,118 --> 00:21:48,935
She's being so obvious now.

401
00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:52,627
She must be so worried that
I might start dating Dayeong!

402
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,865
Why are you smiling all of a sudden?

403
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,249
No reason.

404
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,970
But why?

405
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:03,890
Why shouldn't I go out with Dayeong?

406
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,974
I think I made a mistake.

407
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,458
A mistake?

408
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:14,177
What kind of mistake could you
have possibly made, Suyeon?

409
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:16,884
The thing is, Wooshik... Actually,

410
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:18,846
Dayeong is...

411
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,275
Okay, that's enough.
I know everything.

412
00:22:22,364 --> 00:22:23,587
You do?

413
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:27,438
-Really?
-How could I not know?

414
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:28,780
It's so obvious.

415
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,585
So you could tell.

416
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,942
Of course. Do you take me for a fool?

417
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:37,599
What is it? What's so funny, you two?

418
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:40,330
Oh, it's a secret.

419
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:43,888
A secret between Suyeon and me.

420
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:49,642
Since it's getting late,
shall we say good bye?

421
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:51,965
Already? Why don't you go ahead?

422
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,869
We'll go after a cup of coffee.

423
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,425
-Is that okay, Wooshik?
-Shall we?

424
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,186
Somewhere nice.

425
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,679
-A nice place would be...
-What are you talking about?

426
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:02,678
You're going to get coffee?

427
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:07,276
I'll take care of things.
Don't worry and go on home. Okay?

428
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,488
Oh... Okay.

429
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:12,449
Dayeong, wait for me.

430
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,050
My muscles feel like
they're going to pop.

431
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:30,480
It's been a long time,
but I can't see my feet moving.

432
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:31,856
I can see them very well.

433
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,099
I should go to sleep
before my muscles explode.

434
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:40,085
I can still do 1,000 more kicks...

435
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:41,986
...but I should get
some sleep for tomorrow.

436
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,461
-Good night, then.
-You, too.

437
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:18,752
Hey, Kibong.

438
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,292
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:28,832
-What did I do?
-I never told you this...

440
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,593
...but did you know that
you always hog the blanket?

441
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,717
When did I do that?

442
00:24:33,915 --> 00:24:35,664
You hog the blanket more often than I do..

443
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:36,687
Whatever.

444
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:41,157
If you take the blanket
to your side one more time...

445
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,732
I won't let it slide.

446
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,413
You're not going to let it slide?
What are you going to do?

447
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,380
What? Do you want to see your own demise?

448
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,470
Demise, my butt.

449
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:53,878
So what are you going to do about it?

450
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:55,521
You punk!

451
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:58,731
What the hell? I've had enough of you.

452
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,009
Guys, have you seen my phone?

453
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:09,462
What are you guys doing?

454
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:15,526
He keeps hogging the blanket!

455
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:18,317
I did not. Do you have proof? Do you?

456
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:22,001
All right. Let's settle once and
for all on who takes the blanket.

457
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,999
Fine. Let's do that.

458
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:24,917
Let's take it outside.

459
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:28,241
Thank you for the coffee.

460
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:29,827
It was nothing.

461
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:32,664
Wooshik.

462
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:35,664
When shall we meet again?

463
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:36,582
What?

464
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,781
Dayeong, I need to tell you something.

465
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,879
-What is it?
-Actually...

466
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,370
Can you wait?

467
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:47,856
Hey, Yuri.

468
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:55,565
He's at it again.

469
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:59,409
Why does that jerk keep taking
phone calls in mid-sentence?

470
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,229
He's got no manners.

471
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:03,759
No manners!

472
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:05,487
No manners!

473
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:09,540
Really? Suyeon blatantly told
you not to date her?

474
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:10,939
Yes, I'm telling you.

475
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,858
She clearly likes me, just like you said.

476
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:16,509
I would've made a fool
out of myself if it weren't for you.

477
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:17,529
Thanks, sis.

478
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:20,737
No need to thank me.

479
00:26:21,564 --> 00:26:23,725
It's time to seal the deal now.

480
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,062
-Seal the deal?
-You have to ask Suyeon out!

481
00:26:26,146 --> 00:26:27,643
Ask her out? Already?

482
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:30,932
If you want to make it work,
it has to be when she's desperate.

483
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:34,527
-Don't you trust me?
-I do. Without a shadow of a doubt.

484
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:35,702
But how do I ask her out?

485
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,192
What? You made plans
of having a family with her.

486
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,490
You don't have one to ask her out?

487
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:42,190
Come on, that's too much.

488
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,259
I do have one plan, though.

489
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,539
No manners! No manners!

490
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:48,841
No manners!

491
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:53,761
I feel much better now.

492
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,120
I'm sorry, Dayeong. It was urgent.

493
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,346
It's okay. By the way...

494
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,665
What was it that you wanted to tell me?

495
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,900
Oh, that. Well...

496
00:27:09,197 --> 00:27:11,508
...I think today will be the last
time we see each other.

497
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:14,466
I actually have someone that I like.

498
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,973
Then why did you agree on a blind date?

499
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,745
I was in a bit of a situation.

500
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,993
Situation? What was that situation?

501
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:24,462
Tell me.

502
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:26,455
I can't really tell you.

503
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:29,520
But why are you talking down
to me all of a sudden?

504
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:32,720
Cut the nonsense and tell
me, you bonehead!

505
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:33,810
Are you messing with me?

506
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:36,448
Why did you come on a blind date
if you like someone else?

507
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,774
Are blind dates your hobby?
Is it a leisure for you?

508
00:27:38,956 --> 00:27:42,755
You... You... Useless piece of shit!

509
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,673
Dayeong!

510
00:27:49,052 --> 00:27:49,971
Okay.

511
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:52,464
I'll give you one last chance.

512
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:54,700
What was your situation?

513
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,652
Tell me.

514
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:59,627
I told you, I can't tell you.

515
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,294
You need a lesson.

516
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:22,170
Dayeong, what are you doing?
Are you looking for something?

517
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,942
Why are you raising that chair?

518
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:38,849
Now, let's find out who
the real owner of that blanket is.

519
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:39,892
Before that...

520
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:42,863
...let's agree not to hold
each other responsible...

521
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:44,867
...for whatever will happen
during this fight.

522
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,017
-Okay?
-Of course.

523
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,305
All right, Shall we begin?

524
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:52,531
Don't regret it.

525
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:10,593
Excuse me.

526
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:15,940
Misters, I'm really hungry right now.

527
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:17,326
Give me some money.

528
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,641
Okay, wait.

529
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:21,893
-Where is the...
-Hey. What are you doing?

530
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:28,389
Hey, kid. What did you just say?

531
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:31,923
Hey. Are you trying
to extort money from us?

532
00:29:32,007 --> 00:29:33,797
I'm just asking you to lend me some.

533
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:35,148
I don't know when I'll
pay you back though.

534
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,691
You don't know when?

535
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:40,476
-I'm speechless.
-Seriously.

536
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,543
Hey Kibong, we can't let this slide.

537
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:44,792
-Let's take care of him first.
-All right.

538
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:48,902
Hey, kid. Stay right where you are.

539
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,398
It's so pretty.

540
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,879
I'm cold.

541
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,059
Yuri, why are we here at this hour?

542
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:06,777
It's just that the weather is so nice.

543
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:08,757
It's not nice at all.

544
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,629
I heard there's a lot of fine dust today.

545
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:13,150
Still, it is a nice atmosphere here.

546
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:19,809
-Why are you laughing?
-Because you're cute.

547
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:23,555
I thought you were a stuck-up snob,
but you are a woman after all.

548
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:25,293
What do you mean?

549
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:26,899
I know everything too.

550
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:28,979
You set up Wooshik
on a blind date, didn't you?

551
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:29,897
What?

552
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,332
Yes.

553
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:35,283
Were you really that anxious about it?

554
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:39,679
Yes, I was really anxious.
I shouldn't have set him up.

555
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:42,303
Why did you set him up in the first place?

556
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,732
You should've just come clean.

557
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:45,126
I know.

558
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,600
But I didn't know that she was a psycho.

559
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:49,529
What?

560
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:50,997
Psycho?

561
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,955
-Who?
-The girl I set him up with.

562
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:57,304
It turns out, she was a total psycho.

563
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,832
I was so anxious she might
hurt Wooshik or something.

564
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:01,749
What?

565
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,162
Wait a minute.

566
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,112
That's what you were anxious about?

567
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:10,414
There's no other reason besides that?

568
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,792
Another reason?

569
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:14,773
No. Why?

570
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:18,678
This is not good.

571
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:22,400
Oh, gosh!

572
00:31:24,164 --> 00:31:25,183
What is this?

573
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:26,918
And what is this song?

574
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:32,935
I'm not sure. I guess
they're doing something here.

575
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,477
Suyeon, let's go. It's cold.

576
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:37,728
I think there's some sort of event.
Let's take a look.

577
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,032
Why bother? There's so much
fine dust right now.

578
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:41,335
Come on, let's go.

579
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,332
Suyeon!

580
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,104
It's Wooshik.

581
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,483
What's he doing here?

582
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:17,967
What? Yuri, is he bleeding from his nose?

583
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:20,906
And what's with the bouquet?

584
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:23,818
The thing is...

585
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,117
...he's working part-time.

586
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:28,151
He got a part-time job
selling flowers here.

587
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:30,812
So let's not bother him and go, okay?

588
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,209
But we should still say hi.

589
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:34,552
What for? You see each other every day.

590
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:35,750
Let's go.

591
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,843
Wooshik.

592
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,263
We're not buying.

593
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:44,390
We're not buying.

594
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:47,014
We're not going to buy flowers!

595
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,275
Don't come. Don't!

596
00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:52,732
We're not buying!

597
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:56,841
No, that's not it. We're not buying!

598
00:32:57,571 --> 00:32:58,680
I said, we're not buying!

599
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:07,827
This is driving me crazy.

600
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,979
What should I do?

601
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:14,738
Suyeon.

602
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,572
I...

603
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,101
-like...
-No!

604
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:41,596
Yuri, what are you doing?

605
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:48,355
I said I don't want to buy flowers.

606
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,952
But he kept bothering me.

607
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:52,392
But still.

608
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:54,659
Wooshik.

609
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:56,793
Wooshik.

610
00:33:57,834 --> 00:33:59,681
Wooshik, open your eyes.

611
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:00,685
Brother.

612
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,833
Hey, what happened to your faces?

613
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:07,854
Did you guys have a real fight?

614
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,467
So, who became the real
owner of that blanket?

615
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,595
What? It was a draw.

616
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:17,459
It was a neck and neck battle.

617
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:19,823
Fighting Kibong wasn't
as easy as I thought.

618
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:21,876
It was a a well-matched contest.

619
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:25,584
Excuse me.

620
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:28,290
Yes, who are you?

621
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,171
I'm sorry for visiting so late at night.

622
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:33,405
Do Mr. Lee Jungi and
Mr. Kook Kibong live here?

623
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:36,168
Yes, that's us. What's this about?

624
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:37,997
Well, the thing is...

625
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:39,811
One moment please.

626
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,046
Om Sokdae! Get in here!

627
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:50,671
What is this about?

628
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,345
Well, my son had...

629
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:55,912
...these wallets inside his backpack.

630
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,085
These are yours, right?

631
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,776
Yes...

632
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,305
"ID Card, Lee Jungi"

633
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:07,271
These are yours all right.

634
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:09,390
But why were these in his backpack?

635
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,478
We just gave them to him
so he can buy snacks.

636
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:15,602
High school kids these days
have a tough time studying.

637
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:18,060
My son goes to middle school.

638
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:20,785
-Second year.
-Second year?

639
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,507
So you're in middle school.

640
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,143
Middle school students these days have
a hard time going to cram schools.

641
00:35:26,228 --> 00:35:27,275
Then you could've given him cash.

642
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,892
Why gave him your wallets?

643
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,478
Well, that's...

644
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,994
The wallets were old,
so we gave them to him as a gift.

645
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:35,377
Is that so?

646
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:38,436
Then why gave him your IDs
and credit cards as well?

647
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:41,889
So he can learn.

648
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,683
It was out of courtesy to show him
what an adult's wallet is like.

649
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,519
Wait... Did this kid take your wallets?

650
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,614
Did your faces end up like that
because he beat you up?

651
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,010
Om Sokdae, come clean, now!

652
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:55,534
Did you hit these men?

653
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,004
Well, I didn't have a choice
because they tried to hit me first.

654
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:03,106
I'm sorry.

655
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,866
You guys got your butts kicked
by a middle school student?

656
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:09,466
He's not an ordinary middle school
student. You weren't there to see it.

657
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,364
He literally flies through the air.

658
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,311
Yeah. But I only took a little beating.

659
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:14,798
-Jungi took most of the beating.
-What?

660
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:17,325
He got his back nailed
by that kid's elbow.

661
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,325
I wasn't being nailed.
It was defense using my back.

662
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:23,338
You were choking after you got
kicked in the solar plexus.

663
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,325
No, I wasn't.
I was just catching my breath.

664
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,740
Also, it didn't even hurt that much.

665
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:28,035
It didn't hurt for me either.

666
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,388
Don't you know how tough I am?

667
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:32,318
-I'm indestructible.
-Indestructible, my butt.

668
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:33,839
You got down on your knees first.

669
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,320
You started bleeding first.

670
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:36,664
You started crying first.

671
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:38,129
You called him "big bro" first.

672
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:43,037
Brother, I'm sorry.

673
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,146
Go away!

674
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:50,400
I'm the crazy one for believing you.

675
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,745
I said, I'm sorry.

676
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,216
How can I make it up to you?

677
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,590
Tell me.

678
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:00,042
Really?

679
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,423
Wait here.

680
00:37:02,507 --> 00:37:03,775
Okay, I'll wait.

681
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:11,458
Wooshik, what are you looking for?

682
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,581
Do you want me to look for you?

683
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:28,514
Wooshik, why are you raising that broom?

684
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:29,813
-Come here.
-What?

685
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:30,941
Come here.

686
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,807
-Calm down, Wooshik.
-Come here.

687
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:34,519
-Calm down.
-Come here.

688
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,140
-Come here!
-No!

689
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:37,555
-Come here!
-Get away from me!

690
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:38,687
Come here!

691
00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:42,527
-Wooshik.
-Come here!

692
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:52,377
I can't breathe.

693
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,615
I can't breathe, jeez!

694
00:37:56,678 --> 00:37:58,410
What is this? Jungi, what is...

695
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,028
What on earth? What is he doing?

696
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:04,741
Chairman Kim, come on!

697
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:08,638
Chairman Kim? What kind of
dream is he having?

698
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:09,751
Chairman Kim.

699
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,878
Let's do the backstroke.

700
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:16,784
He must've gone insane.

701
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:22,366
Stop it, you crazy jerk!

702
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:24,874
That hurts.

703
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:30,286
Ouch, my chin.

704
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:34,546
How could she throw a back spin
elbow at her own brother?

705
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,292
And what? Suyeon likes me?

706
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:39,071
I'm the idiot for trusting her again.

707
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:40,358
Brother.

708
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:43,815
Have some kimchi on the side.

709
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:47,414
Would I be eating this porridge
if I could chew kimchi?

710
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:49,501
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:53,326
But, what are you going
to do about Suyeon?

712
00:38:53,784 --> 00:38:55,100
I don't know.

713
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,733
You know what? I have a good idea
to capture her heart...

714
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:00,220
Darn it, be quiet!

715
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,240
I won't believe a word you're saying!

716
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:06,689
-My goodness.
-You guys awake?

717
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:08,124
Good morning.

718
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:09,547
Want some porridge?

719
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:11,785
You guys can't chew either
with your mouths busted.

720
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:12,798
It's fine.

721
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:15,250
I saw something I shouldn't have
seen, so I lost my appetite.

722
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:16,523
Why? What happened?

723
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:19,375
While he was sleeping, Jungi went
completely insane on the bed...

724
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,111
...wearing nothing but his underwear.

725
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,644
What? Why?

726
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:25,698
The thing is, I had a really cool dream.

727
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,823
A cool dream?

728
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,639
You want to know?

729
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:33,670
In my dream, I was climbing a mountain.

730
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,057
But I saw a sign in front of me.

731
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:38,032
"1,000 meters to the top
of Paektu Mountain".

732
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:41,484
It was Paektu Mountain.

733
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:45,580
I kept climbing and climbing
and finally reached the top.

734
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,510
Heaven Lake.

735
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:50,679
The view of Heaven Lake spread out
right before my eyes.

736
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,096
So I took my clothes off, jumped
into the lake, and started swimming.

737
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:55,881
I swam in every way possible.

738
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,393
Freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke,
and even dog-paddle.

739
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,199
And right at that moment...

740
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:04,415
My gosh!

741
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:09,284
Chairman Kim?

742
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,557
-What?
-Oh, sure.

743
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:19,495
You mean, you saw the leader
of North Korea in your dream?

744
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,109
That's what I'm telling you.

745
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:23,020
In Heaven Lake, he and I...

746
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:25,330
...swam together,
and I even scrubbed his back.

747
00:40:25,414 --> 00:40:27,107
It was a blast.

748
00:40:27,206 --> 00:40:28,705
It's cool, isn't it?

749
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:30,151
It is cool.

750
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:33,430
I heard seeing a famous person in
your dream brings you good luck.

751
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,010
Maybe something good will happen to you.

752
00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:38,038
There's no such a thing.
I don't believe in those superstitions.

753
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:40,651
Jungi, then just sell the dream to me.

754
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,127
-Sell my dream to you?
-Yes.

755
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:43,711
Nothing's working out for me these days.

756
00:40:43,796 --> 00:40:45,969
I'm hoping to get some dream effect.

757
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:47,781
-"Dream effect"?
-Wait.

758
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,580
Here, I'll buy it for 10,000 won.

759
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:51,681
-Really?
-Yes.

760
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,671
-Okay!
-Nice. So you sold it to me.

761
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:54,821
Okay.

762
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:56,554
Yay, free money.

763
00:40:58,174 --> 00:40:59,290
10,000 won.

764
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:10,193
Nice pitch!

765
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:11,916
Hey, Kibong! Let's take a quick break.

766
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,751
Okay, great work!

767
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,708
Guys, gather around!

768
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,946
-Okay!
-I have an announcement to make.

769
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,868
The first team coach called me.

770
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:25,266
Many of their players are injured,
so they need a replacement right away.

771
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:29,115
So the coach would like to test
you guys tomorrow.

772
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,771
So be fully prepared. Got it?

773
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,009
-Yes!
-Yes!

774
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:36,004
A test to join the first team?

775
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,767
Nice.

776
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,521
I feel so bad that you
can't even eat pizza.

777
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,167
Does your jaw still hurt a lot?

778
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,257
No, I'm fine.

779
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:48,782
Why did you bother Yuri
and provoke her to hit you?

780
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:50,710
Don't bother her from now on.

781
00:41:50,794 --> 00:41:53,511
Okay, I won't.

782
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,659
This is so good.
How can it be this delicious?

783
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:59,650
Right? It tastes even better because
it was bought with free money.

784
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,445
Hey. Eat slowly,
or your stomach will get upset.

785
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:03,822
I don't have time.

786
00:42:03,907 --> 00:42:05,293
I have to eat quickly and
head out for my shift.

787
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:06,792
You have another shift?

788
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:09,727
How many part-time jobs do you have?

789
00:42:09,812 --> 00:42:11,238
Are you going to stop acting?

790
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:14,975
Acting? Jeongeun is into acting?

791
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,095
You didn't know?

792
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,639
We both majored in
Theater and Film Studies.

793
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:21,409
We used to shoot films
and dramas together.

794
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:22,647
Seriously?

795
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:24,642
How come you're not acting anymore?

796
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:28,212
Well, I had a bit of a situation.

797
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,182
I should get ready for my shift.

798
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:33,522
Hey, finish your pizza first.

799
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:37,798
Hey, guys!

800
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,091
I have big news.

801
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:40,738
What is it? What happened?

802
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,460
I have an evaluation tomorrow for
possibly joining the major league.

803
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,562
If I pass it, I may be able to
join the major league again.

804
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,661
Really? That's great.

805
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:53,276
I know, right? But I think it's all
because of Jungi's dream I bought.

806
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:56,436
The test got scheduled out of the
blue as soon as I bought the dream.

807
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,018
Hey, how can it be because of the dream?
That's nonsense.

808
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:01,196
It's not nonsense.
Don't you know the story?

809
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,632
General Kim Yushin's sister bought her
elder sister's dream and became a queen.

810
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:08,734
Right, many people win the
lottery after having a good dream.

811
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:11,496
-What?
-Jungi, you must be jealous.

812
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:13,991
You sold your lucky dream
for just 10 dollars.

813
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:18,949
Hey, give back my dream.

814
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:21,216
I'll give you back your 10,000 won.
I want my dream back.

815
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,501
No way. You sold it to me,
so you can't get it back.

816
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,433
Then I'll give you 20 dollars.

817
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:26,620
No thanks.

818
00:43:26,825 --> 00:43:28,806
Well, I should go wash up.

819
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,174
Hey, that's my dream. Hey, wait.

820
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:32,659
-I'll give you 30,000 won.
-Forget it.

821
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,634
50,000 won then. Give it back, please.

822
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:42,616
Go a little easy on that.

823
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,211
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,039
It's done. Do you want one more?

825
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:50,730
Forget it. This is so embarrassing.

826
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:52,455
Hey, give it back.

827
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,997
Give it back! Give me back my dream.

828
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,505
Jeez, stop it already!

829
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,454
Are you guys still arguing
over that dream?

830
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:02,181
Don't even get me started.
He threw a tantrum all night.

831
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:04,487
It's my dream. Give it back!

832
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:05,441
I don't want to.

833
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,898
All right, time for breakfast.

834
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,344
Darn it.

835
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,463
What's that?

836
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,717
-Gimbap.
-Oh, gimbap?

837
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:17,355
Hey, I want some too.

838
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,200
-What the?
-Hey.

839
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:22,502
It's already spoiled.

840
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:24,241
Really? That's good.

841
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:25,341
Let's see.

842
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:29,646
Yes. It's completely spoiled.

843
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:31,578
Goodness, he's doing it again.

844
00:44:31,663 --> 00:44:32,799
Doing what again?

845
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:37,288
Kibong has to eat spoiled gimbap
whenever he has an important game or test.

846
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:39,135
What kind of superstition is that?

847
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,679
All right, shall I eat now?

848
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:48,742
Wow, that's good. It tastes
like fermented skate.

849
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:49,758
It's good.

850
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:51,859
You greedy pig.

851
00:44:51,944 --> 00:44:55,017
You have this superstition.
Give me back my dream!

852
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:56,814
What? I can't hear you.

853
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:57,732
What?

854
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:00,175
Ugh, it smells like warm garbage.

855
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,215
-Hello.
-Hey.

856
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:15,348
Nice, here comes the nature's call.

857
00:45:15,968 --> 00:45:18,880
This feels exactly like the day...

858
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,185
...when I pitched a shutout
in high school.

859
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,274
Good.

860
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:28,261
Hey.

861
00:45:30,507 --> 00:45:31,559
Hello.

862
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:34,187
What on earth are you doing?

863
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:35,712
Oh, this?

864
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:38,048
You didn't know? That's his superstition.

865
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:41,254
He has to wear a pantyhose
before a match or a test...

866
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,840
...to pitch a smooth breaking ball.

867
00:45:42,925 --> 00:45:45,688
He makes such a big deal
out of a superstition.

868
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:47,466
-Let's get ready.
-Okay.

869
00:45:57,976 --> 00:45:59,171
-Kibong, you're here early.
-Hello..

870
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:00,291
Kibong, you're here early.

871
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,708
Kibong, you're here early.

872
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:06,545
Don't be surprised.
He has to do everything four times.

873
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:08,751
Kibong, good luck today.

874
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,532
-Good luck to you...
-Kibong, good luck today.

875
00:46:10,617 --> 00:46:13,249
Good luck today.

876
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:15,102
Thank you.

877
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:17,045
I don't have to answer four times, right?

878
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,854
I'd appreciate it if you did.

879
00:46:18,939 --> 00:46:20,912
I'd appreciate it if you did.

880
00:46:20,996 --> 00:46:22,280
Enough!

881
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:26,517
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

882
00:46:27,473 --> 00:46:28,306
Let's go.

883
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,235
Let's go.

884
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:35,481
-What are you so happy about?
-What?

885
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:38,963
Just now, you were going crazy because
Kibong wouldn't sell your dream back.

886
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:41,180
I bought the dream back.

887
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:42,967
Really? How?

888
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,119
"For the dream"

889
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:47,453
Kibong, why is there money
attached to your back?

890
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,799
What? Money?

891
00:46:50,797 --> 00:46:51,855
Look.

892
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:53,475
What? What is this?

893
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,118
-For the dream.
-"For the dream"?

894
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,340
What dream?

895
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:59,250
That jerk Jungi...

896
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:03,009
-Hello.
-Attention, everyone.

897
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:04,621
I'm really sorry.

898
00:47:04,706 --> 00:47:07,283
The coach had an urgent
business to take care of.

899
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:09,186
He needs to move the test to tomorrow.

900
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:12,801
So just follow your regular
training routine today, okay?

901
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:14,109
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

902
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:16,581
It's postponed?

903
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:19,017
Why all of a sudden?

904
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:20,964
Ouch, my stomach hurts.

905
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:23,751
Wait a minute.

906
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:26,277
Could this be happening
because he took the dream?

907
00:47:26,964 --> 00:47:29,606
Lee Jungi, that jerk!

908
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:33,467
Whatever. I bought
that dream back, got it?

909
00:47:34,008 --> 00:47:35,474
Not my problem. Bye!

910
00:47:36,337 --> 00:47:38,532
He must be flipping right now.

911
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:40,294
Who is this?

912
00:47:41,022 --> 00:47:41,855
Hey, bro.

913
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:43,677
What?

914
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:45,161
Really?

915
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:47,079
Of course! I'd love to.

916
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,816
Thanks.

917
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:50,332
What's going on?

918
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,798
I just got called in for an audition
that I really wanted to try out.

919
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:55,899
-Wow, really?
-What is going on today?

920
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:57,872
Wait a minute.

921
00:47:58,555 --> 00:47:59,586
-Yuri.
-What?

922
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,606
Maybe it's because of that dream.

923
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:03,621
Dream? The one you took back?

924
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,624
Yeah. I got a call
to try out for an audition...

925
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:07,551
...right after I bought the dream.

926
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,695
You're right. It is because of the dream.

927
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:12,806
It is a lucky dream after all.

928
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,745
"You go ahead, comrade."

929
00:48:16,347 --> 00:48:17,834
"What about you, comrade?"

930
00:48:17,997 --> 00:48:19,299
"Let's run away together."

931
00:48:19,384 --> 00:48:20,764
"There's no time."

932
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:22,717
"You must live."

933
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:25,281
"As long as you're alive, I will be too."

934
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:30,033
"You are right here, my dear comrade."

935
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,343
"Comrade, I love"...

936
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:34,318
"I love"...

937
00:48:35,388 --> 00:48:38,261
I can't do this! I can't!
It makes me cringe.

938
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:41,280
-Can you be more serious?
-It's too cheesy.

939
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:43,054
Then forget it! Don't do it.

940
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,944
-I'm home.
-Jeongeun!

941
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:49,926
Why are you so late?
I almost died waiting for you.

942
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,136
What? What are you up to now?

943
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,710
I have an audition tomorrow.
Can you help me practice?

944
00:48:55,795 --> 00:48:56,836
Sorry?

945
00:48:58,037 --> 00:49:00,227
No. I just came back
from work and I'm tired.

946
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:02,058
Hey. Come on, help me out.

947
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:03,382
Hey!

948
00:49:03,653 --> 00:49:05,291
I need your help. Hey!

949
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:11,476
She's so mean. I guess work is
more important than friends.

950
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:14,156
She's obsessed with money.

951
00:49:15,442 --> 00:49:16,565
Oh gosh!

952
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,590
What the hell? You scared me!

953
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:21,520
Oh, yeah. How did your test go?

954
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:23,100
It's postponed to tomorrow.

955
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,547
This is all your fault, jerk.

956
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,854
What? How is it my fault?

957
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:31,447
Right after you stole my dream,
my test got postponed.

958
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:34,656
So give me back my dream. Give it back!

959
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:37,326
Dream? Okay, I'll give it back.

960
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:38,723
Get your own dream!

961
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:39,859
Lee Jungi!

962
00:49:43,264 --> 00:49:45,871
Hey. What's wrong with you?

963
00:49:45,956 --> 00:49:48,886
My stomach. It hurts so bad.

964
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,684
You ate an entire row of spoiled gimbap.
No wonder you got stomachache.

965
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:54,939
Go to the toilet.

966
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:59,781
I can't. I never went to the toilet
when I pitched a shutout.

967
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,576
What if I jinx it by going to the toilet?

968
00:50:02,661 --> 00:50:06,231
So you'll hold it until tomorrow
without going to the toilet?

969
00:50:06,316 --> 00:50:07,227
Of course!

970
00:50:07,312 --> 00:50:11,256
I already lost my dream.
And if I jinx this, I might fail the test.

971
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,270
I must make it
to the first team this time.

972
00:50:13,355 --> 00:50:15,679
I will make it no matter what.

973
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:18,482
Oh, no...

974
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:21,760
Okay.

975
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,692
What are you doing?

976
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:33,297
This would make them go back up.

977
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:36,318
You really are an idiot, aren't you?

978
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,487
All done.

979
00:50:57,936 --> 00:50:59,266
So tired.

980
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,965
How many part-time jobs do you have a day?

981
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:14,492
Are you going to give up on acting?

982
00:51:21,527 --> 00:51:22,981
"You are right here,
my dear comrade."

983
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:26,436
"You are right here"... Oh, shoot.

984
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:28,884
Why can't I get into character?

985
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:29,927
Oh my gosh!

986
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:32,133
You're still doing this?

987
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:33,890
It's all your fault.

988
00:51:33,975 --> 00:51:36,074
So give me back my dream. Give it back!

989
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,776
-I don't want to.
-Hey, hold it right there!

990
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:42,066
That jerk... Lee Jungi! Hey!

991
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:46,574
Quit following me around. So annoying!

992
00:51:46,659 --> 00:51:50,383
Then give me back my dream. Right now!

993
00:51:50,468 --> 00:51:52,315
I have to make the first team!

994
00:51:52,399 --> 00:51:54,252
And I have to pass this audition!

995
00:51:54,337 --> 00:51:57,291
Also, it was my dream to begin with!

996
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,166
You sold it to me!

997
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,780
So I gave your money back!

998
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:03,757
You jerk.

999
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,490
Zip your mouth and
give it back right now!

1000
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,705
Did you just grab me with your feet?

1001
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,608
You really want to see the end, huh?

1002
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:18,596
Yes, let's see that end or whatever it is.

1003
00:52:20,005 --> 00:52:22,883
Give it back! I said give it back!

1004
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:24,189
Give it!

1005
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,073
What?

1006
00:52:34,528 --> 00:52:35,524
Where am I?

1007
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:40,858
I guess I fell asleep while cleaning.

1008
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:45,888
What? What is that sound?

1009
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,610
What? Who is that old man?

1010
00:52:54,645 --> 00:52:55,686
What time is it?

1011
00:52:56,862 --> 00:52:57,937
5 o'clock?

1012
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:01,278
They already opened the shop.

1013
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:02,878
What should I do?

1014
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:05,312
Oh well.

1015
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:08,552
I should get out when
it's not too crowded.

1016
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:29,145
Darn it!

1017
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,941
Oh gosh, my stomach.

1018
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,715
Why are they not starting yet?

1019
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,675
This is all because of
that jerk, Lee Jungi.

1020
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,234
"You are right here, my dear comrade."

1021
00:53:58,242 --> 00:53:59,535
"You are right here, my dear comrade."

1022
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,294
"You are right here... my dear comrade."

1023
00:54:03,026 --> 00:54:06,376
-Hello everyone.
-Hello, sir.

1024
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:08,381
-Hello.
-Hello.

1025
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,748
You prepared your own costume?

1026
00:54:11,683 --> 00:54:14,582
Yes, sir. I believe an actor
must be prepared for his role.

1027
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:16,727
What a great attitude.

1028
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:18,526
I'll see you at the audition then.

1029
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:19,692
Good luck.

1030
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:21,444
Yes, sir.

1031
00:54:22,154 --> 00:54:23,483
Thank you!

1032
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:28,262
Everything is going so well.

1033
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:32,917
I said it was a lucky dream.

1034
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:45,494
Next! Kook Kibong!

1035
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:49,026
Where is Kook Kibong?

1036
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:51,875
I'm here, sir.

1037
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,042
Hey, what's wrong? Are you sick?

1038
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:00,963
No, sir. I'm fine.

1039
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:08,379
I'm almost there.

1040
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,074
Kibong, hold it in just a little more.

1041
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:13,086
-Just a little more.
-Who's the next batter?

1042
00:55:13,304 --> 00:55:14,137
That's me.

1043
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,538
"Gwak Hani"

1044
00:55:18,623 --> 00:55:21,006
That's me. That's me. That's me.

1045
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:23,741
What? Hani is my partner?

1046
00:55:24,552 --> 00:55:25,385
Shoot.

1047
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:30,373
-Next, Lee Jungi?
-Yes, sir.

1048
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,627
Don't get nervous, Jungi.
You'll get it this time.

1049
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:39,642
You practiced so much.

1050
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,160
And I also had a lucky dream.

1051
00:55:41,597 --> 00:55:42,606
Let's go for it.

1052
00:55:42,867 --> 00:55:44,339
Let's do this!

1053
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:54,491
Why Hani of all people?

1054
00:55:54,576 --> 00:55:55,903
This is driving me crazy!

1055
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,854
Why is he taking so long to prep?

1056
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:34,900
Gosh, what should I do?

1057
00:56:35,848 --> 00:56:38,127
All right. Let's figure this out.

1058
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:42,504
The longest I can hold
is maybe two minutes.

1059
00:56:42,952 --> 00:56:45,662
Let's say Hani takes about
30 seconds per batting...

1060
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:49,751
...if I strike him out,
it'll be 1 minute 30 seconds.

1061
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:52,869
30 seconds to run to the toilet.
So it's two minutes in total.

1062
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:55,766
Okay. Two minutes is more than enough.

1063
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:59,497
But, I must strike him out at all costs.

1064
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,571
Three strikes!

1065
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,529
Throw it! Throw it!

1066
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:04,245
Throw it! Throw it!

1067
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:12,489
Okay, strike!

1068
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:19,711
My gosh, does he have to repeat that too?

1069
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:22,980
Hurry up! We don't have all day!

1070
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:26,142
I'll hurry. I'll hurry, sir. I'll hurry.

1071
00:57:26,297 --> 00:57:27,185
My apologies.

1072
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:32,075
Exactly four times, huh?

1073
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:42,760
Throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it.

1074
00:57:45,939 --> 00:57:47,597
Okay! Two strikes...!

1075
00:57:54,174 --> 00:57:55,105
I held it in.

1076
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:58,062
Hurry up, already!

1077
00:58:02,285 --> 00:58:03,399
I can't hold it any longer.

1078
00:58:04,872 --> 00:58:07,813
I have to finish it
with this pitch no matter what.

1079
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:08,934
No matter what!

1080
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:12,255
Throw it. Throw it. Throw it. Throw it!

1081
00:58:28,941 --> 00:58:31,586
Hey Kibong. Are you coming back
from training?

1082
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:33,543
What about the test? Did you pass?

1083
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:35,145
I failed. Why?

1084
00:58:35,617 --> 00:58:39,471
The batter hit a home run
on me so I failed.

1085
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:43,362
This is all your fault, punk!

1086
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:46,843
It's because you stole that lucky dream!

1087
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:49,807
How is that my fault?

1088
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,753
Lucky dream, my butt.

1089
00:58:51,837 --> 00:58:53,201
I failed too.

1090
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:55,662
What? You too?

1091
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:56,727
Yeah.

1092
00:58:57,053 --> 00:58:58,117
My turn came...

1093
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,704
...and I swung the door
open as I entered...

1094
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:03,919
...and the director got knocked out
by the door on his way out.

1095
00:59:04,004 --> 00:59:05,932
Anyway, that's what happened.

1096
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:07,711
That totally sucks.

1097
00:59:08,826 --> 00:59:09,659
What?

1098
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,364
Then that wasn't a lucky dream.

1099
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,219
Lucky dream, my butt.

1100
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,454
It turned out to be a silly dream!

1101
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:18,487
Shut up. Let's just go home.

1102
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:23,041
Hey, I have to make a stop at some place.

1103
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,778
Make a stop? Where?

1104
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,297
"Men's Bath"

1105
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:32,065
Hey, why did you want to come
to the sauna all of a sudden?

1106
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,460
Don't ask anything.

1107
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:36,414
Your fragile mind can't handle it.

1108
00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:39,254
Whatever, forget it.
I don't want to know anyway.

1109
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:43,360
I'll go cool myself down.

1110
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:50,054
This feels good. So nice.

1111
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,962
Nothing's working out for me these days.

1112
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:58,236
Then what was that dream about?

1113
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:01,377
Whatever. I don't care.

1114
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:02,833
I'll take a swim.

1115
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:06,760
This feels so good.

1116
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:15,047
Oh, my gosh!

1117
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:16,814
Hey, Jeongeun. Are you here for swimming?

1118
01:00:16,899 --> 01:00:18,715
Wait, what the hell! Hey!

1119
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,134
Why are you in here?

1120
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,516
This is the men's bath!

1121
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,712
Well... I was cleaning this place
during my shift and I fell asleep.

1122
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:29,459
-What?
-Jungi.

1123
01:00:29,664 --> 01:00:31,568
Please take me out of here.

1124
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,283
I'm freezing to death.

1125
01:00:34,368 --> 01:00:37,021
Gosh, Kim Jeongeun, how could you be so...

1126
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:38,658
Wait, wait.

1127
01:00:39,485 --> 01:00:41,354
Kim... Kim Jeongeun.

1128
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:42,506
Kim Jeong...?

1129
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,145
Kim Jeongeun?

1130
01:00:45,178 --> 01:00:46,243
Chairman Kim?

1131
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:49,663
Then that dream was...

1132
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:52,837
Wait, what?

1133
01:00:53,801 --> 01:00:55,011
"Heaven Lake Sauna"?

1134
01:00:55,806 --> 01:00:56,639
Wait.

1135
01:00:57,178 --> 01:00:58,207
Heaven Lake.

1136
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,959
So this is what the dream was about?

1137
01:01:02,398 --> 01:01:04,022
Darn it!

1138
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:05,494
Seriously!

1139
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:10,012
Serves you right!

1140
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:13,151
What? So you mean, that Kim Jeongeun...

1141
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:15,778
...wasn't that man in the north
but it was actually this Jeongeun.

1142
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:18,079
And Heaven Lake was a sauna?

1143
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:19,780
Yes, I'm telling you.

1144
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:23,501
This brat Jeongeun is no
help to my life at all.

1145
01:01:23,586 --> 01:01:25,760
Stop it. It's not like
I did it on purpose.

1146
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:29,768
Just how much money are you trying to make
by working all day like that?

1147
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,649
It seems like she's totally money hungry.

1148
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:34,218
I said, stop it!

1149
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:40,850
What's wrong with her?

1150
01:01:40,934 --> 01:01:43,433
Why do you ask? It's because of you.

1151
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:45,999
This guy just doesn't know when to stop.

1152
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:58,782
What are you doing here?

1153
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:01,925
I'm sorry.

1154
01:02:02,479 --> 01:02:04,485
I was a bit harsh just now.

1155
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:07,554
-Forget it.
-So don't work too much.

1156
01:02:07,905 --> 01:02:10,990
This happened because you were
exhausted and deprived of sleep.

1157
01:02:12,013 --> 01:02:13,349
Do you really need cash that desperately?

1158
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:14,893
It's not because of money.

1159
01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:16,855
Then why are you overworking yourself?

1160
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:18,468
Because I might want to do it again.

1161
01:02:19,473 --> 01:02:20,870
I might get tempted again.

1162
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,432
On what?

1163
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,038
Acting.

1164
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,759
Then you can just start acting again.

1165
01:02:27,843 --> 01:02:28,909
Actually...

1166
01:02:30,005 --> 01:02:31,295
...I gave up on acting.

1167
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:35,391
You know that I don't
have much talent in acting.

1168
01:02:35,476 --> 01:02:36,755
What are you talking about?

1169
01:02:37,702 --> 01:02:39,405
You've done a lot so far...

1170
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,857
So you want me to keep trying?

1171
01:02:41,456 --> 01:02:42,549
But what if you're wrong?

1172
01:02:43,117 --> 01:02:44,803
What if I don't make it in the end?

1173
01:02:45,808 --> 01:02:47,425
That thought scared me...

1174
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:49,219
...and made me anxious.

1175
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:51,341
It was too much.

1176
01:02:54,339 --> 01:02:55,745
That's why I gave up.

1177
01:02:57,477 --> 01:02:58,332
So?

1178
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:02,090
Do you feel better after giving up?

1179
01:03:03,085 --> 01:03:04,030
You don't.

1180
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,059
It's harder for you.

1181
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:08,040
Am I wrong?

1182
01:03:11,646 --> 01:03:12,691
You're right.

1183
01:03:13,365 --> 01:03:15,253
I keep auditioning when there's no hope.

1184
01:03:15,554 --> 01:03:17,445
I take minor roles
without even a single line.

1185
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:19,975
It makes me anxious and exhausted.

1186
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:22,323
But do you know why I don't give up?

1187
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:25,618
Because things will just
get harder if I give up.

1188
01:03:26,912 --> 01:03:28,910
I know that doing something
that I don't want to do...

1189
01:03:29,028 --> 01:03:31,083
...is a hundred times harder..

1190
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:33,599
Jeongeun.

1191
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:37,996
If you're going to suffer whether
you decide to give up or continue...

1192
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:40,866
...wouldn't it better to suffer
while doing something you like?

1193
01:03:43,155 --> 01:03:45,689
Maybe it's because I'm dumb,
but that seems to be the right answer.

1194
01:03:47,187 --> 01:03:48,227
Maybe it's not.

1195
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,702
I better go down and eat something.

1196
01:03:52,217 --> 01:03:54,514
You should come down too. See you.

1197
01:04:06,862 --> 01:04:08,565
Jungi! Wait for me.

1198
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:09,902
-What?
-Wait for me.

1199
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,907
Are you going to hand out your profile?

1200
01:04:11,992 --> 01:04:14,466
Yes. There's a lot of
new movies being made.

1201
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,059
Really? Then I want to tag along.

1202
01:04:17,143 --> 01:04:18,800
What? Tag along?

1203
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,420
Does that mean you'll start acting again?

1204
01:04:24,504 --> 01:04:25,337
What?

1205
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:27,134
Well...

1206
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:31,287
...maybe it's because I'm stupid,
but I think you're right.

1207
01:04:31,603 --> 01:04:34,072
If I'm going to suffer either way,
it would be better...

1208
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:35,647
...if I do something that I like.

1209
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,166
I guess dumb people like us
have to work harder to make it up.

1210
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:42,986
Do you have your profile?

1211
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:44,123
Of course.

1212
01:04:45,555 --> 01:04:46,998
How come there's so many?

1213
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:51,243
My gosh, what is this?

1214
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:53,162
No, this is not good.

1215
01:04:53,246 --> 01:04:56,094
Holy cow! This just won't do.

1216
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:59,007
What is up with this pose?
This isn't the '80s!

1217
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:01,052
It's an old photo from before.

1218
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:03,969
Still, isn't it sexy?

1219
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,653
Sexy?

1220
01:05:05,996 --> 01:05:09,276
Sexy? Do you really think this is sexy?

1221
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,218
No way in hell this can be called sexy!

1222
01:05:11,303 --> 01:05:13,045
Looks like a chewed up dumpling!

1223
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:14,032
Dumpling?

1224
01:05:14,363 --> 01:05:17,084
Hey. Didn't I tell you not
to call me by that nickname?

1225
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,301
I'm sorry, Dumpling.
No, I'm sorry, Jeongeun.

1226
01:05:20,385 --> 01:05:22,452
You little... Come here.

1227
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,888
I told you not to call me that!

1228
01:05:25,575 --> 01:05:28,035
Okay, wait. Now you're an angry dumpling.

1229
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:31,849
Dumpling.

1230
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:37,022
This dumpling's out of control.

1231
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,776
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1232
01:05:47,563 --> 01:05:49,605
It's been so long.
Do you think I can do this?

1233
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:50,740
What is your name?

1234
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,195
My name is...

1235
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:54,735
Are you okay? You were scared, right?

1236
01:05:54,819 --> 01:05:56,598
What's wrong with your friend?
You said she's good.

1237
01:05:56,683 --> 01:05:57,934
You mean Jeongeun's been fired?

1238
01:05:58,019 --> 01:05:59,293
What? A blind date?

1239
01:05:59,378 --> 01:06:01,545
He said he'd teach me the forkball
if I introduce you to him.

1240
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:02,941
Wow, he's handsome.

1241
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,073
He's totally my type.

1242
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:07,825
What's wrong with his laughter?

1243
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,690
Suyeon's ideal type of guy is a nice guy.

1244
01:06:10,774 --> 01:06:12,439
-A nice guy?
-Wooshik, teach me how to sing.

1245
01:06:12,524 --> 01:06:14,832
You must not get angry
in front of Suyeon, okay?

1246
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:20,810
Stop! Stop! Han Suyeon!
