1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,605
There's no end to these stickers.

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:11,708
Now that the stickers and the holes
are gone, it makes me feel happy.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,488
Exactly. I really thought
we'd be kicked out this time.

4
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,599
It's all thanks to Suyeon.

5
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:21,528
But don't you feel strange
living with your first love?

6
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:23,423
I can't even sleep.

7
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,195
Wooshik, you feel excited too, right?

8
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,660
Why would I? I feel nothing.

9
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:31,565
What?

10
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,668
What a load of crap.

11
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,470
I wonder who was the one
who jumped out of Rebecca...

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,678
...when Suyeon was
mistreated by her in-laws?

13
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:42,342
And the one who wanted to look for
Suyeon's stuff was you! It's you!

14
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,958
Really? Wooshik did?

15
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,379
Yes, he did!

16
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,982
Why? Do you feel sorry for Suyeon?

17
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:51,685
Or did you old feeling resurface
because you've met your first love?

18
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:52,857
That's not why!

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,755
-You're talking nonsense.
-Guys.

20
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:57,357
How do I look?

21
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,667
Do I look like a successful career woman?

22
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,506
What? You kind of do...

23
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:04,398
But why are you so dressed up?

24
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:05,799
I'm going to get a job.

25
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:10,108
That way, I can get back my house,
pay back dad's loan and bring him home.

26
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:11,505
That's so cool.

27
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:14,818
I thought you'd be crying and
whining for some time.

28
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:16,009
Don't you think so, Wooshik?

29
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,914
Your intention is admirable,

30
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,217
but getting a job won't
be easy these days.

31
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,419
Wooshik!

32
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,321
Do you want to make a bet with me then?

33
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:31,024
Whether or not I got a job, the loser
will get hit on the forehead 10 times.

34
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:32,326
Sure, the deal is on.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,307
How can you hit me for real?

36
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,803
A bet is a bet.

37
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,706
I've told you that getting
a job is not that easy.

38
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,708
Suyeon, don't worry too much.

39
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,009
You can just look for part-time jobs.

40
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:51,387
She got fired from all her part-time job.

41
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,117
Just what did she do
to get fired like that.

42
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:55,215
What can I do when it's my
first time doing part-time job.

43
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,717
It's hard and boring.

44
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,527
That's why instead of just
doing whatever you can find,

45
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,622
look for something that suits you.

46
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:05,192
Do you have anything you
want to do or any dream?

47
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:08,996
I used to have a dream of
becoming an announcer.

48
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,398
They look so elegant on news.

49
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,407
Should I just be an announcer?

50
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:15,502
You can't even look for part-time jobs.

51
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,904
Are you good ant anything?

52
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:19,136
What I'm good at?

53
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:22,303
I'm good at dancing.

54
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,711
I was even chosen as the Dancing
Queen at the club before.

55
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,313
Forget it.

56
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,328
Jeongeun, do you have any
part-time job that she can do?

57
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:33,840
There's exactly one that suits Suyeon.

58
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:36,104
Really? What is it?

59
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:40,727
Are you telling me to do this?

60
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,331
You can inform about new
products like an announcer,

61
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:46,108
and you can even dance.

62
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,702
So, a narrator model is perfect for you.

63
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,617
-But, this is a bit...
-I guess you're not desperate enough.

64
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,707
-Forget it then.
-No.

65
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:55,809
I'll do it. I'll do it.

66
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:58,712
I'll leave first, so do your best.

67
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,517
Here, take this.

68
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:06,586
Should we start?

69
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,292
Hello. We are giving away
sample from Bear Skin.

70
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:16,563
It's perfect for hydration,
whitening and anti-aging.

71
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,564
Welcome!

72
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,665
Are you telling me...

73
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,367
...I need to do that?

74
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,003
Gosh, so embarrassing.

75
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,479
How many reserved guests do we have?

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,481
We don't have any.

77
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,183
How many months has it been?

78
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,684
Exactly.

79
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,554
Why don't we get any customer?

80
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:42,867
I really want to know the reason.

81
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,867
Won't the biggest problem
be lack of promotion?

82
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,461
Other places even do big events.

83
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:48,462
Event?

84
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,608
Then, we can just do event.

85
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,521
What do you think about
famous actor signing event?

86
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:54,521
-Famous actor?
-Yes.

87
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,537
Who else. Of course, it's me.

88
00:03:57,632 --> 00:04:00,543
I'm someone who even rose
to the top search ranking.

89
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:03,043
My signature is very cool.

90
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:04,044
Do you want to see?

91
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,948
Let's see.

92
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:16,398
Lee...

93
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,793
Jun...

94
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,495
Gi...

95
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,297
Enough! Will you even be able to
sign five signature at that rate?

96
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,234
And who would be crazy enough to
come here to get your signature?

97
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,530
Let's not do it then.

98
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:33,148
But, no matter how you promote,
the best way is to get a TV appearance.

99
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,541
I'm home.

100
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,844
Welcome back. Did you introduce
a good part-time job to Suyeon?

101
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,991
I did but I'm not sure
if she can do it well.

102
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,186
Gosh, I'm just worried about what kind
of trouble she's going to cause next.

103
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,590
Wooshik, are you worried?

104
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,462
Are you nervous that your first love will
have a hard time? Is it driving you crazy?

105
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,081
I wonder why?

106
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,800
I wonder why is Wooshik so worried?

107
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,193
That's not it!
Crazy jerk, it's not true!

108
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,272
Crazy jerk! That's not it!

109
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,976
Lee Jungi, that brat has a
knack for infuriating people!

110
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:12,279
Why would I bother about Suyeon?

111
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,381
And what? First love?

112
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,917
It's been more than 10 years.

113
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:18,819
Shower time.

114
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,821
Lee Jungi, what do you think you're doing?

115
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,422
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were inside.

116
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,025
Whatever. Just get out! Hurry up!

117
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,193
Why are you so angry?

118
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,097
What's the big deal? We're both boys!

119
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:31,698
What's wrong? Are you shy?

120
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,200
Should I scrub your back?

121
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,863
It's a miracle cream...

122
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,574
Please take them.

123
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,844
It's a miracle cream...

124
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:49,249
What's with your voice?
Aren't you going to do it properly?

125
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,051
I apologize.

126
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,352
Why? Are you embarrassed?

127
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,454
If so, just quit.

128
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:55,956
No.

129
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,960
-I'll do well.
-It's the last warning.

130
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,861
Yes.

131
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,664
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

132
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,066
Should I just quit?

133
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:09,269
No way. Cha Wooshik will make fun of me.

134
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:13,473
But I'm so embarrassed. What do I do?

135
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:22,883
This morning, a bear escaped
from the Korean Zoo.

136
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,284
Oh my gosh!

137
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,685
A bear?

138
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,255
Welcome.

139
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:31,258
"A bear escaped from Korean Zoo"

140
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,264
Where is the beer?

141
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,965
My eyes.

142
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:41,664
What is this?

143
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:44,348
Aren't you being too much?

144
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:45,872
I told you to get out.

145
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,148
But still, how can you throw
a soap to someone's face?

146
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,076
It would be dangerous
if it got into my eyes.

147
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,378
And you call yourself my friend?

148
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,814
Did you two fight again? What's wrong?

149
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,919
He made a huge fuss because I
got in while he was showering.

150
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,922
He's so fussy.

151
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:06,726
When we were in school, he even secretly
changed his gym uniform in the toilet.

152
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:08,900
-But why?
-How would I know?

153
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:12,098
It's not like that thing would
disappear if someone sees it.

154
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,301
Why did you do that?

155
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,617
Are you not confident or something?

156
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,606
What are you saying. Why wouldn't I be?

157
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,608
Hey, I'm...

158
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:27,113
When the ob-gyn doctor, Dr. Choi Dalbong
saw me when I was born,

159
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:31,251
he fell into a great shock
and quit his job as a doctor.

160
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:32,757
What a load of crap.

161
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,956
-Let's see then .Let's see!
-What do you mean?

162
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,340
Forget it.

163
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,858
Don't believe me then.

164
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,037
Everyone can bluff like that!

165
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,529
You see, mine is... drop it. Let's stop.

166
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,531
Hey, Jeongpal.

167
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,007
I asked you to come up with a promotional
idea. Why are you watching the TV?

168
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,726
I'm just resting for a bit.

169
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,739
-Look at that. It's so fascinating.
-What is?

170
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,128
If I don't do this,

171
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,747
I can't live because it would be too cold.

172
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:59,713
-40 degrees?
-The lady gets cold easily,

173
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,516
so even with the boiler up to 40 degrees,
she still needs to wrap herself that much.

174
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:04,484
Even in summer,

175
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,987
-she can't go out because it's too cold.
-What?

176
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,076
-She gets cold easily?
-Yes.

177
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,092
Can you go on TV for being like that?

178
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,087
Don't you know that show?

179
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,895
-Weird and special people appear on it.
-Really?

180
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,866
Then, let's go on it as well.

181
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,648
That would be a great promotion for us.

182
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,248
That's true but what's so weird
about us to go on that show?

183
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,072
We need to start thinking of it now.

184
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:27,941
Hey!

185
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,477
I can cry in 10 seconds.

186
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,776
Do you want to see?

187
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,248
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

188
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,083
six, five...

189
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,253
You can see this, right?

190
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,556
-You can see my tears, right?
-It's cool but...

191
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,337
...can you do it without the snot?

192
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,761
Snot? No I can't.

193
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:50,263
The snot automatically
comes out with tears.

194
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:52,766
But I can do it with just the snot.

195
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:54,634
I can even shoot out the snot.

196
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:57,037
-It's so dirty, it won't get on broadcast.
-Do you think so?

197
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,874
-Do you have something else?
-Right.

198
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,144
I do have something.

199
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:06,579
Okay, let's start.

200
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,283
"Flower, by Kim Chunsoo"

201
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,888
It's working!

202
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,890
Oh my gosh!

203
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,792
It's working!

204
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,695
-It's fascinating, right?
-Amazing!

205
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,297
I'm more comfortable writing with my toes.

206
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,000
Why? Why? What's wrong?

207
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,468
I got a cramp!

208
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,470
-Do something!
-What?

209
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:31,687
What the...

210
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,873
I can do it,

211
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,675
but I can only do it for 10 seconds.

212
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:36,776
10 seconds?

213
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,280
This won't work. It's not it either.
What's the use of 10 seconds?

214
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,981
Guys...

215
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,684
I have something too.

216
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,209
Hold on. What did I just watch?

217
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,739
What do you think?
It's interesting, right?

218
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,209
That's too plain.

219
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,811
I've seen people who are better
at it than you on the TV.

220
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:15,915
A lot of people can do it,
but not all are as natural as I am.

221
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,417
The passion is different.

222
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:18,717
You can hear the sorrow in mine.

223
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,220
What a nonsense.

224
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,538
Don't you have something else?

225
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,826
-I'm back.
-Welcome.

226
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,329
Gosh, that's cold.

227
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,632
It's so cold outside,
why are you dressed like this?

228
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,734
Look at that.

229
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,242
He even drinks ice coffee.

230
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,138
I have a lot of heat.

231
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,577
I'm such a hot man.

232
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,548
Keep on being hot then.

233
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,144
So annoying.

234
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,245
Wait a minute.

235
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:47,147
Jeongeun,

236
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,749
the lady on the TV just now,

237
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,649
gets cold easily, right?

238
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,119
Yes, why?

239
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:54,654
Hey Kibong,

240
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,411
since you're a hot man,

241
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:58,925
you don't feel cold?

242
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:01,060
That is kind of true.

243
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,164
So, that's the case.

244
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:11,237
-Excuse me.
-Yes, who is it?

245
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,077
Yes, hello.

246
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:17,086
Hello. I am the producer for
"How is that possible", Lee Sion.

247
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,846
Yes, right. Hello. Nice to meet you.

248
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,658
I'm Lee Jungi, the one who sent the story.

249
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,249
I see.

250
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,857
I heard that there's someone
who can't feel cold at all?

251
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,804
-Is it true?
-He's my friend.

252
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,967
He doesn't feel cold at all. Never.

253
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,159
I see.

254
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,375
Where can I meet him?

255
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,086
-He's at the rooftop right now.
-The rooftop?

256
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,207
-Let's go.
-Sure.

257
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,508
Come on in.

258
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,400
Let's go.

259
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,939
Will it be fine?

260
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,241
I feel uneasy.

261
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,811
There he is. Over there.

262
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,317
It's so cold but he's staying outside?

263
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,288
-Together with a fan?
-Yes.

264
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:57,827
Even if we stop him,

265
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:00,827
-he won't listen to us at all.
-Lee Jungi, you rascal!

266
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:02,121
Kibong!

267
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,756
Yes. Why?

268
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,734
Should we head over there?

269
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:06,359
-Kibong? Kibong.
-Yes.

270
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,830
The producer from
broadcasting station is here.

271
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,731
I see.

272
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,437
I heard that you can't
feel coldness at all.

273
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:15,635
-Is it true?
-What?

274
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,169
Yes, that's true.

275
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:22,775
You look cold and your lips are trembling.

276
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:26,888
No, that's not true.
It's because he lacks magnesium.

277
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:27,880
I see.

278
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,297
-Seems like he has goosebumps too.
-What?

279
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,398
No, it's just that his skin has always
been like this since he was born.

280
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,794
-It was his complex since he was young.
-Yes, my complex.

281
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,196
I don't think so.

282
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:46,177
Actually, he looks quite cold.

283
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:48,278
I told you no. Why are you like this?

284
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,477
Are you like this because
you can't trust us?

285
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,281
No way. No, that's not why.

286
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,576
It's just that we keep on
receiving fake reports.

287
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:59,379
Kibong, it seems like the
producer doesn't trust us.

288
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,780
Just show it then.

289
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:01,481
What?

290
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:03,913
-Show what?
-What do you think?

291
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:05,987
You're only wearing
that to not get tanned.

292
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,597
Usually, you don't wear anything.

293
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:11,157
The producer doesn't believe it.
So, just show it to him.

294
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:14,460
-Take it off.
-Okay.

295
00:13:15,051 --> 00:13:16,362
Just in case I get tanned.

296
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,965
-The UV rays is very strong anyway.
-My goodness, will you be okay?

297
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,780
-It's very cold!
-He'll be fine.

298
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:23,870
-At times, he'll go all nude even.
-I don't get it.

299
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,077
-Right, Kibong?
-It's so good right now.

300
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:26,953
Yes, of course.

301
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:29,575
It's great! Can you drink some coffee?

302
00:13:56,838 --> 00:14:00,740
It's a brand new cream product.
Please get the sample.

303
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,542
Come and get your sample.

304
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:04,344
Come closer.

305
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:07,146
This promotion doesn't come everyday.

306
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,550
-Here...
-I guess you're all used to it now?

307
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,752
Well, it's nothing.

308
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,355
I need to go to the bathroom to
wipe off my tears for a minute.

309
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,723
Sure, go ahead.

310
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,524
-See you later.
-Sure.

311
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,328
Next news.

312
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:28,134
The bear that escaped the Zoo this
morning has been spotted around Namsan.

313
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:30,939
Around 100 specialists were
dispatched and they're consists of...

314
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:35,048
...the SWAT team, Special Rescue Team,
and Animal-Rescue Association.

315
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:37,243
My goodness. Namsan is so close by.

316
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,746
That's going to be a big problem.

317
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,326
What the? Why is it flickering?

318
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,729
Gosh, I'm already dizzy.

319
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:58,664
It's so hot.

320
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,266
Let's wash up.

321
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,007
Gosh, my goodness!

322
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,319
What's that?

323
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:30,930
Perhaps...

324
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,331
...is it the bear?

325
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,554
It's so cold.

326
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,034
So he stays here for the whole winter?

327
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:48,181
Yes. I also lend him this tent
because I don't use it anymore.

328
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,750
Then, how does he eat?

329
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:54,047
He doesn't eat a lot of things
because he says they're hot.

330
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:56,043
So, he eats ice cream for all three meals.

331
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,734
-Just ice cream?
-Yes, just ice cream.

332
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,559
Right, Kibong?

333
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,260
What?

334
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,779
-Yes, sure.
-I prepared it just in case.

335
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,548
My gosh! Amazing!

336
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,270
Kibong, let's eat. Here's your meal.

337
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,087
-Wow, it must be good.
-Wait, for today...

338
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:21,288
Record it.

339
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,187
-Here you go.
-The spoon, see.

340
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,784
Wow, amazing.

341
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,257
-But this...
-It looks delicious!

342
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,659
-One spoonful.
-He's on an empty stomach.

343
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,564
My goodness, your teeth must hurt.

344
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,278
Wow, you're really amazing!

345
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:44,577
If he's in the mood,
he'll like it if we throw this.

346
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,042
-I see.
-He likes it.

347
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,475
That's a lot better.

348
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:53,279
Since I need to start the job again,

349
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,696
Why am I feeling nauseous?

350
00:17:04,906 --> 00:17:06,993
Did I drink too much beer?

351
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:18,738
Over here! Over here!

352
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,542
-Did you make the report?
-Yes, I did.

353
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,144
But where is the bear?

354
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,146
It is in the toilet.

355
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,058
The toilet? It wasn't a mistake?

356
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:32,358
I saw it with my own two eyes.

357
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:35,254
It was rummaging through the
trash can and made a huge mess.

358
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:36,382
Really?

359
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you hear that?
It's the roaring sound of a bear.

360
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:50,236
My goodness! I guess it's true.

361
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,405
This is bad.

362
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:56,309
Listening to its roar,
the bear must be angry right now.

363
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,210
We need to catch it before it gets worse.

364
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,011
Let's go.

365
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,322
I feel a bit better now.

366
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:24,370
Chief.

367
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,072
It's really a bear.

368
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:28,674
But does bear drink standing up?

369
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:32,244
Of course. They are very agile.

370
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,946
I think now's the right time.

371
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,748
Let's shoot the tranquilizer. Hurry up.

372
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:00,940
Mister...

373
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,441
What is this?

374
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:07,747
He's killing Kibong.

375
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,717
I wonder how is Suyeon doing right now?

376
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,619
Did she get fired again?

377
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:15,388
No, wait.

378
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,376
I don't care if she gets fired or what.

379
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:19,892
Yes.

380
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,194
Wooshik, take a look at this! See?

381
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,797
Why? What's the matter?

382
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,700
What do you think? Fascinating, right?

383
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,402
It's your first time seeing someone
eating ramyeon with their feet, right?

384
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,704
Don't you think it's more
fascinating than Kibong?

385
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,717
It sure is fascinating, your brain.

386
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:35,717
I just feel so unfair.

387
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,310
How can such talent be
disregarded because of Kibong?

388
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,012
This is much better. Ouch!

389
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,415
I got a cramp! Cramp!

390
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,116
-My goodness!
-Help me!

391
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,652
Why are you being greedy
over something like that?

392
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:48,921
No one in this house is normal!

393
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,932
A bit harder.

394
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,923
-Here?
-Yes.

395
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,226
A bear escaped from Seoul's
largest theme park...

396
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,327
Bear?

397
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:59,477
A bear escaped from a zoo, and
everyone's making a fuss about it today.

398
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,384
-You don't know about it?
-Really?

399
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:06,739
A woman was mistaken for the bear,
and was shot with a tranquilizer.

400
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:09,842
It's a clip from a witness.
Take a look at it.

401
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,644
Miss, wake up.

402
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,515
When I heard the roar,
I automatically shot the tranquilizer.

403
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:17,516
What's going on?

404
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,244
Suyeon. Suyeon, are you okay?

405
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,747
Suyeon? Suyeon, open your eyes.

406
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,216
Hey, be quiet. Everyone's watching!

407
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,684
I'm already so embarrassed!

408
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,985
Are you fine?

409
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,121
-Are you really okay?
-I've told you I am!

410
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,993
How can you cause trouble
every single time?

411
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:02,495
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:05,998
But why are you angry?
Since when do you care about me?

413
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:07,032
Care...

414
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:09,835
Who says I care about you?

415
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:13,005
I was worried that I need to spend
money because you cause trouble again.

416
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:15,717
How could you say that to someone sick?

417
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,610
You look fine enough.

418
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,880
Hurry, get up. Let's go home.

419
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,482
Hey, wait for me.

420
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,512
Wooshik!

421
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,620
You want me to go in there?

422
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:30,856
If we don't do this,
the viewers won't believe us.

423
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,757
Right?

424
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,460
Of course! A broadcast is not a joke!

425
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,661
He'll go in for sure.

426
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:40,065
Kibong, you can do it, right?

427
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:43,007
I can't do it. I really can't.

428
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:45,114
No. You can do it!

429
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,336
You're the hot man!

430
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,487
Also, if he just go in,
it will be a bit boring.

431
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:56,388
So, I will put in some,
just very little bit of ice.

432
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:58,497
Inside here? You want to put ice inside?

433
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:01,305
Sure, just put it in.

434
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:04,712
I was going to put it in anyway.
We always play around like this.

435
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,902
Kibong, you can do it, right?

436
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:08,437
Right?

437
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,707
No. I can't.

438
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,923
It's not right to put ice inside
the water in such weather.

439
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:15,052
No! You can do it.

440
00:22:15,162 --> 00:22:16,261
So...

441
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:20,944
Just close your eyes and go in.

442
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:38,078
-Okay, go in.
-What?

443
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,175
Okay, sure.

444
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:51,493
Jungi, it's cold. It's extremely
cold.I feel like my toes are frozen.

445
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:53,078
That's just your feelings.

446
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:54,479
We're nearly there.

447
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,485
Go in now. Hurry!

448
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:22,592
Wait, are you feeling cold now?

449
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,808
I think I heard your scream of pain?

450
00:23:23,892 --> 00:23:25,201
No...no...

451
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:26,717
It's because he likes it.

452
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:28,815
It's like, "I like it! I like it!"

453
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:32,116
-I see.
-I like it! I love it!

454
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:33,616
Yahoo!

455
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:35,814
I like it! I like it!

456
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:39,984
Since you've seen that he likes
it, it's the end, right?

457
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,098
No, wait a minute.

458
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:43,584
Lastly, can you dive in?

459
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,491
This jerk!

460
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,188
-How do you know he likes it?
-Really?

461
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,490
Hold on a second.

462
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,376
Kibong!

463
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:52,882
Show it to them.

464
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:54,679
You have a diving license.

465
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,227
You can do it!

466
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,627
No, I can't do it. I really can't.

467
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:00,618
Diving in is really impossible.

468
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:02,446
Just endure it once.

469
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,250
If you pass this one,
we'll be on the show.

470
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,251
Hurry and dive in!

471
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,555
It's already cold right now.

472
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,558
It's just your feeling.

473
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:13,516
You're the hot man!

474
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,387
You mean jerk!

475
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:24,415
Wow, he really did it!

476
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,369
He really can't feel coldness.

477
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:27,778
Let's find a suitable date.

478
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,052
Then,

479
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,835
-you're done with checking?
-Yes, of course.

480
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,118
-You can tell him to come out now.
-Really?

481
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,323
Kibong, it's done. You can come out now.

482
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:37,716
So, when will the show..

483
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:40,300
It will probably come
out in two weeks or so.

484
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,533
Kibong, what are you doing? Come out now.

485
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:43,928
Kibong!

486
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:45,513
-Prepare everything.
-Kibong?

487
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:48,543
Kook Kibong? Kibong!

488
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:50,260
Kibong!

489
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:52,563
Kibong! Kibong!

490
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:54,783
Hey, wait for me!

491
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:57,168
I say, wait for me.

492
00:24:57,252 --> 00:24:58,414
Then, hurry up.

493
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:04,713
Just walk slowly.

494
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:09,089
This is so embarrassing.

495
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,583
You should have bring some changing
clothes with you when you came.

496
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:13,884
It already came out on the news.
Why are you embarrassed now?

497
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:14,679
What?

498
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:17,021
News? What do you mean?

499
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:21,718
I guess you don't know yet?

500
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,839
Suyeon,

501
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,657
look at this.

502
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:29,261
Not just the news, you came
first in the most search ranking.

503
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,168
"Tranquilizer bear woman"

504
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:33,574
This was you. Look.

505
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,152
What is this?

506
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,475
It's driving me crazy!

507
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,578
I shouldn't have done that job.

508
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,265
I won't ever do the job again.

509
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:44,477
What do you mean?

510
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:46,891
Are you going to quit already?

511
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,324
Well...

512
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:51,811
It's just so tiring and embarrassing.

513
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:54,418
Han Suyeon, stop acting like a princess.

514
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:59,182
You hate it because it's
tiring, embarrassing, and boring?

515
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:01,476
Then, just what job will you do?

516
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:04,562
And you say you want to
bring your father back?

517
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:09,453
Suyeon, you can't just live
by only doing what you like.

518
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,867
You also need to endure and
do the things you don't like.

519
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:13,664
Everyone lives like that in the world.

520
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:16,565
The same goes for Jungi,
Kibong, Jeongeun and me.

521
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:17,840
Everyone lives like that.

522
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:20,656
And you also need to
start living like that.

523
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:24,325
You need to start figuring
things out by yourself.

524
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:29,730
Fine.

525
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:33,052
I just need to do it.

526
00:26:35,182 --> 00:26:36,277
Aren't you hungry?

527
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,672
There's a delicious hotteok place nearby.

528
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:39,776
Hotteok?

529
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:42,747
I want to eat steak. Steak?

530
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,350
Forget it if you don't want.

531
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,054
No. No. Let's eat it.

532
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,452
Instead, can you buy me two hotteok?
Just two?

533
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:53,012
-Fine.
-Two?

534
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:55,318
Yes, you can. Stay away, it's disgusting.

535
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:57,021
Kibong, are you okay?

536
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,912
-Jungi...
-Kibong...

537
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:00,174
What's going on?

538
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,269
What happened to Kibong?

539
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:03,568
What happened was...

540
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:06,258
Why do you swim on such a cold day?

541
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,638
Actually...

542
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,417
Kibong is someone who
doesn't feel coldness.

543
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:13,820
-The world's hottest...
-Shut up!

544
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:15,627
Such person doesn't exist in this world.

545
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:18,274
He could have died from hypothermia.
Do you understand?

546
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:20,393
-I apologize.
-Let's go.

547
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:23,091
Jungi, I'm cold.

548
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:24,588
It's so cold.

549
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:25,668
I'll go to you later.

550
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:27,360
Kibong...

551
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:31,572
It was kind of suspicious.

552
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:34,307
Do you have to go this far to be on TV?

553
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,898
-I apologize.
-I knew this would happen.

554
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,802
I told you not to do it.

555
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:40,907
Such an embarrassment.

556
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:46,557
It was such a waste of time.

557
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:48,156
Let's go.

558
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,782
Wait.

559
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:01,098
Producer, what about this?

560
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:03,283
It's fascinating, right?

561
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:06,300
If this goes on TV,
everyone in Korea will be shocked.

562
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:10,049
I got a cramp. Help me! Cramp!

563
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:12,238
Just ignore her. I apologize.

564
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,368
-It's not moving. Cramp.
-Excuse me but where is the toilet?

565
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,148
It is right behind there.

566
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:18,745
Thank you.

567
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:23,247
Oh my, I apologize.
I thought it's the toilet.

568
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:27,648
-Wait a minute.
-What are you doing?

569
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:29,547
-Get out now!
-Hold on.

570
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,648
This... This is...

571
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:35,797
-What's wrong with it?
-What do you mean?

572
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,594
Hurry up and leave!

573
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:40,198
Why is it here? It's not...

574
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:42,227
...supposed to be here, right?

575
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,951
Cha Wooshik, please. Please.

576
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:47,211
Can't you appear just once?

577
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,118
This is such an amazing item!

578
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:51,917
-I said no! What's wrong with you?
-But Wooshik...

579
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,200
Is it here?

580
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:57,503
It really is there. For real.

581
00:28:59,752 --> 00:29:02,952
That's why you made such
a big fuss last time.

582
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,837
That doesn't make sense.

583
00:29:04,946 --> 00:29:07,957
What the? Are you a goat?

584
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:10,338
Wow! We've got a title!

585
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:11,727
Huam-dong's goat man.

586
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,727
It will be a hit for sure.

587
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:16,341
-We need to do it.
-I said I won't do it.

588
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:18,123
I won't do it. Never!

589
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,235
Just appear on the show.

590
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:23,042
-Aren't you going to save the business?
-That's my complex.

591
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:24,334
I can't do it! I won't!

592
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,126
I won't do it! Never!

593
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,518
Hey Cha Wooshik!

00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,426
You're so funny.

595
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:30,826
Why are you saying two different things?

596
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:31,878
What are you talking about?

597
00:29:31,962 --> 00:29:34,174
You said we can't live
doing only what we want.

598
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:36,056
And we need to endure and
do what we don't like?

599
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,850
You said that just now. You did!

600
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,133
My goodness.

601
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,241
Why do you say two different things?

"Waikiki Guest House"

603
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,214
It's time! It's time.

604
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:52,838
It's the story about Huam-dong's Goat Man.

605
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:55,431
-It's us.
-That's us.

606
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,817
-So exciting.
-In order to confirm this,

607
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,401
-we came to check it ourselves.
-Anyone's home?

608
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,408
Yes, we're here.

609
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:03,501
Hello.

610
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:05,325
Oh, hello. Yes.

611
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:08,662
Hey, it's me. That's me! It's me!

612
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:10,344
You're really an actor. You look good.

613
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:12,744
-Please come inside.
-Yes.

614
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,916
-Great timing! There he is.
-Over there? Okay.

615
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,289
Excuse me, hello.
Are you the Huam-dong's Goat Man?

00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,893
Oh yes, hello.

"The Huam-dong's Goat Man!
Choi Wooshik"

618
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:33,808
Is there anything different
about you compared to others?

619
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:35,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

620
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:41,412
Yes, it's located much
lower than most people.

621
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:42,523
I see.

622
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,310
Is it possible for us to confirm this?

623
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,812
-Yes.
-Yes.

624
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,013
I'm embarrassed.

625
00:30:56,121 --> 00:31:01,426
-I can't believe you really did it.
-The staff were worried of his health,

626
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,131
so they took Wooshik to the
hospital for an extensive checkup.

627
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,033
-Thank you. Thank you!
-Doctor,

628
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,936
is there anything wrong
with Wooshik's health?

629
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,138
In my 30 years experience as a doctor,

630
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:15,722
it's the first time that I've
seen nipples located so low.

631
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:17,509
-Same. First for me too.
-It's almost...

632
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:20,112
...at the belly button's area.

633
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,814
It's a unique case in the world.

634
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,983
However, the result from the checkup...

635
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:28,120
...revealed that there's
no problem with his health.

636
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,223
Are there any ways to
relocate his nipples?

637
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,624
Well...

638
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:35,727
He can get a transplant.

639
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:40,298
Wooshik,
will you get a transplant surgery?

640
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,700
No, I won't.

641
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,803
I like myself this way.

642
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,348
I don't have plan on having a surgery.

643
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,864
Wooshik rejected the surgery.

644
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:54,945
Wooshik's heart that loves
even his own complex.

645
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,049
We'll pray that it won't change.

00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,252
Huam-dong's Goat Man, good luck!

647
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,349
Good luck!

648
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:03,455
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

649
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,029
Wooshik, thanks to your chest...

650
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,767
No, wait. Thanks to you, our guest house
gets the proper promotion we needed!

651
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,569
I get it. Just sit down now.

652
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:21,148
Since it has come to this,
let's just change our guest house's name.

653
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,395
To what?

654
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,009
What do you think of this?

655
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,610
Goatkiki Guesthouse.

656
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,913
Goatliki?

657
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:32,828
-Go die!
-Wait Wooshik, no! Stop!

658
00:32:32,912 --> 00:32:34,428
Don't do this!

659
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:35,620
-Hey! Hey!
-Wait, stop!

660
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,924
Where's the Goat Man?

661
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,796
-Hello.
-Have a good time.

662
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,767
It's been such a long time
since we got customers.

663
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,233
This is the importance of broadcasting.

664
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,614
Hey, Jungi. Look.

665
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:53,805
Huam-dong's Goat Man is still
the first one in search ranking.

666
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,206
Tranquilized Bear Girl is number two.

667
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:56,708
-Let me see.
-Amazing.

668
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,711
After becoming the talk of the
town with my funny pronunciation,

669
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,257
I never imagined my friends
would be the first and second...

670
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:05,083
...in real-time ranking at the same time.

671
00:33:05,172 --> 00:33:07,085
Things are slowly working out now.

672
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:09,087
-Greet the guest.
-Welcome!

673
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:10,711
Do you have a reservation?

674
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:11,990
Your name?

675
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,491
-It's under Phillip.
-Phillip?

676
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:14,493
Phillip. Okay then.

677
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,415
-Hi there.
-Nice to meet you.

678
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:21,099
Sorry, but where did they go? The...

679
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,635
Please wait a minute.

680
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,418
Someone is here to meet both of you.

681
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:27,506
Get ready.

682
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,508
Phillip, give me the bags.

683
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:37,582
-Hi.
-Hi.

684
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:39,818
-Hi.
-Hi.

685
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,622
You guys look great.

686
00:33:43,712 --> 00:33:46,224
When you stand like this, you look
like the blue dragon and white tiger...

687
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:47,225
No, wait...

688
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,861
More like, the bear on the
left and goat on the right?

689
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,868
-Shut up.
-Just take the picture.

690
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:53,865
Sure, I will.

691
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:57,269
But you guys look so good together.

692
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,470
You look like a spouse.

693
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,171
-Are you crazy?
-I say shut up!

694
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,873
Alright.

695
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,675
I'll take it now.

696
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:04,876
Okay.

697
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,778
Say, "kimchi". Wait, that's not right.

698
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,983
Goat!

699
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,453
-Goat...
-Goat...

700
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:26,054
We provide customers with
the best price and service.

701
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,534
We work 365 days a year to
reduce your mobile expenses.

702
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,618
Please visit us right now and
receive numerous benefits!

703
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,205
Please visit us!

704
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:38,518
Jeongeun, it's very cold.
Can we rest for a bit?

705
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,916
-Shall we?
-Yes.

706
00:34:40,032 --> 00:34:41,012
Let's go.

707
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,484
-That's more like it.
-Me too.

708
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:48,185
Hey!

709
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:50,589
What do you think you're doing?

710
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,198
It's so cold,
so we're just taking a short break.

711
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,194
Who told you to?
Do you think I pay you to rest?

712
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,696
-We apologize.
-We're sorry.

713
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:58,496
So, what are you doing?

714
00:34:58,997 --> 00:34:59,982
Go and do your work.

715
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:02,300
-Understood.
-You better not slack off again!

716
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,401
Sorry.

717
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,504
That's too much.
It wasn't even one minute.

718
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,807
Let's get to work before
he scold us again.

719
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:10,108
Okay.

720
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,106
The cheapest price in Korea,

721
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:18,894
and we also give a lot of gifts.

722
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,485
Welcome.

723
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:24,397
Don't you think it's
become less cold now?

724
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:25,598
Oh, really?

725
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:27,792
And my bottom feels especially warmer.

726
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,396
By the way,
don't you smell something burning?

727
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:35,400
Suyeon, your tail is on fire.

728
00:35:35,522 --> 00:35:36,901
-What?
-It's on fire!

729
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,007
What is this?

730
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:41,306
Oh my gosh, what's wrong with it?
Why is it on fire?!

731
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:42,874
Put it off now!

732
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:46,544
No!

733
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,217
-Mr. Goat. One picture, please.
-Okay.

734
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,853
Okay. Two, three!

735
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,155
Great!

736
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,268
Thank you! Good luck, Mr. Goat.

737
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:01,059
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

738
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,437
-Wooshik, you did well.
-Hey!

739
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:06,131
Until when are we going to keep this up?

740
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:09,908
What do you mean? Of course
until your nipple goes up.

741
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:11,403
-My goodness.
-Guys!

742
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:14,330
We made huge today,
shouldn't we celebrate it with a party?

743
00:36:14,415 --> 00:36:15,416
Pork belly party!

744
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:17,118
Pork belly, my foot.

745
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:19,502
We're still far from making
up for the losses we've made.

746
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:20,916
Then, we can just do with pork skin.

747
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:22,691
They're cheap,
delicious and good for the skin.

748
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,984
Pork skin have a lot of cholera.

749
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,197
-Cholera?
-Yes.

750
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:30,088
Don't you know cholera?
They use it a lot in skin care products.

751
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,998
Jungi, you know that pork skin
have a lot of cholera, right?

752
00:36:33,082 --> 00:36:35,093
You must mean collagen!

753
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,995
Cholera is an infectious disease.

754
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:41,800
No! I heard it from the owner of the
pig skin restaurant! Cholera is right!

755
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,403
Sure. Go ahead and eat a lot of
cholera and have a glowing skin.

756
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:46,705
We're back.

757
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,606
Bear Girl, you're home.

758
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:49,987
It's very cold outside, isn't it?

759
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,509
Don't even get me started.

760
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,317
After standing outside the
whole day with short clothes,

761
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:58,717
-my body is all frozen.
-I thought we'd die freezing.

762
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,286
I thought you'd give up
but you're working hard.

763
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,188
You told me not to quit.

764
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:06,991
But earning a living is so hard.

765
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,194
It will get on my face! It's all over now.

766
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,597
That's so dirty.
Cover your mouth when you sneeze!

767
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm sorry. I have been getting
chills since just now.

768
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:18,203
-I think I have the flu.
-What? Flu?

769
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:21,005
Go away! Go away, you virus!

770
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,006
No, wait.

771
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,810
Gas mask! Gas mask! My gas mask!

772
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,579
I'm going to eat one more bowl.

773
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:34,119
Why do you yawn so much?

774
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,527
I filled in for Jeongeun
as a chauffeur last night.

775
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,621
-Chauffeur?
-Yes.

776
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,693
I even went to Chungcheong Province
and back.

777
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,882
Chuncheong Province?

778
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:45,597
My goodness. You take care of
your university alumni so well.

779
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,199
She's just a burden. A burden!

780
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,401
She's my karma! Karma! Gosh!

781
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:52,653
Why are you hitting me?

782
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,947
What? Burden? Karma? This brat!

783
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:59,778
Don't hit me! If you hit me again,
I'm going to sue you.

784
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm only letting it slide
because I'm not well.

785
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:04,288
You're still sick? You look pale.

786
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:07,757
I'm not feeling well. But Suyeon had
fever the whole night, it worries me.

787
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,088
Really? Don't you have
to go to see a doctor?

788
00:38:10,182 --> 00:38:12,991
-We don't have time for that.
-We still have event today.

789
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,560
What? Are you going to
work in that condition?

790
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,189
Of course. If we tell them that we can't,

791
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:21,065
-they won't hire us for next event.
-Hey hey...

792
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,377
I will cover for you,

793
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:24,995
so make sure to go to a hospital.

794
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,387
You're going to do promotional event?

795
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,374
Promotional or whatever, why not?

796
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:30,977
Hey, I'm a good dancer.

797
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:32,777
And I'm an eloquent speaker.
You know that too.

798
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:34,685
But still...

799
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:35,986
I can do it.

800
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,597
Then, what about Suyeon?

801
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:38,383
What?

802
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:40,185
Well...

803
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,786
I'll go. I'll do it.

804
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:43,388
What?

805
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:44,989
Wooshik, you?

806
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,175
But why?

807
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,077
In case you faint again and we need
to waste money on hospital fees. Why?

808
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,697
You sure are a trouble maker.

809
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,093
Hey, just forget it.

810
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,670
I'll do it even if I end up fainting!

811
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,585
Forget it. Just go and see the doctor.

812
00:38:57,797 --> 00:38:59,270
-Let's go, Jungi.
-Sure.

813
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,272
Make sure to go see the doctor.

814
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,676
Hey, wait for me!

815
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,077
I'll head to practice.

816
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,879
-Be careful.
-Okay.

817
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,580
Wait for me!

818
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:11,588
Will they be okay?

819
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,318
I wonder.

820
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:22,477
Hey kid.

821
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,308
Why are you throwing the ball to the tree?

822
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:26,887
It's none of your business.

823
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:27,799
You brat!

824
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,808
A tree is a living being too.

825
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:33,705
If you do this, the tree will get hurt.

826
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,707
Whatever. So annoying.

827
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,608
What?

828
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,111
This kid is so rude.

829
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,216
Hey, are you crying right now?

830
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:46,902
I only hit you a bit.

831
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,810
Hey, don't cry.

832
00:39:48,912 --> 00:39:50,688
-Dad!
-Dad?

833
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,192
I'm sorry. Stop crying. Stop!

834
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,362
-Dad!
-It's driving me nuts.

835
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:59,964
Don't cry. I'm sorry.

836
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:08,673
So, both of you are here to fill in
for Jeongeun and Suyeon?

837
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:11,884
Yes. The two of them caught a bad flu.

838
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:14,178
They should have contacted me in advanced!

839
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,352
I've already assigned them to events.

840
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,664
You can give us the job.

841
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,658
We're good at everything.

842
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:21,963
But it's a bit weird
for you guys to do it...

843
00:40:22,058 --> 00:40:23,550
Don't worry about it.

844
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:26,491
Even though we look like this,
we've done a lot of things before.

845
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,397
-Yes.
-We're good at everything.

846
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,793
Yes, we can!

847
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:33,016
By the way, what job is it?

848
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:36,648
"Two wings
Twin Angel"

849
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,805
"Ultra Flower
Absorbs five times better with charcoal"

850
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:43,107
"Sanitary Pads"

851
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,514
Wooshik, this doesn't feel right.

852
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,417
That's right.
But it's too late to say no.

853
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,518
What should we do?

854
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,303
We just need to do it, I guess.

855
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:59,824
Lately, men also do
ads for women products.

856
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,927
It means even men can sell women products.

857
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,329
That's kind of true,

858
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:06,731
but we need to at least
understand what we're selling.

859
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:10,535
We even wrote down
promotional word just now.

860
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,337
We'll be fine if we just follow it.

861
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:16,641
But no matter how many times I read,
I still can't understand anything.

862
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:19,243
Jungi,

863
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:20,819
by the way,

864
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:22,547
what is wings?

865
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,048
-Wings?
-The thing is,

866
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:26,050
why are they on the pads?

867
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:29,854
This Ultra Flower has charcoal in it.

868
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:31,756
But the product is white?

869
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:35,063
If charcoal is in it, why is it white?
Isn't it supposed to be black?

870
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,761
I don't understand either.

871
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,062
Whatever. Whatever.

872
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,755
I don't get anything.

873
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,266
-Shall we start?
-Yes.

874
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:43,468
Let's just start.

875
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,576
What's going on? Why is everyone so early?

876
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,178
Why are they shouting so loud?

877
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,281
Hey, what is going on today?

878
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,683
Didn't you hear?

879
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,184
There are rumors that...

880
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:03,378
...the list of the kicked out people will
be announced before the season starts.

881
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:05,583
-Kicked out?
-That is why...

882
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:10,228
everyone is trying hard to look
good in front of the coach. So hard.

883
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,431
So, you should be careful too.

884
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,967
Don't make any mistake
in front of the coach.

885
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:17,287
Okay, I get it.

886
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,270
Kick out?

887
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:21,079
That can't happen.

888
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:23,274
What do I do?

889
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,191
Darn it.

890
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:35,533
Wow Kook Kibong! That's good!

891
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:36,937
You have spirit!

892
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,610
Thank you coach!

893
00:42:38,727 --> 00:42:40,352
Good!

894
00:42:40,551 --> 00:42:42,053
-Coach!
-Yes?

895
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:44,337
Coach, it's Donghyun. He's here.

896
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,352
Really?

897
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:49,567
By the way, who's Donghyun?

898
00:42:49,663 --> 00:42:51,569
He's coach's son.

899
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,372
He loves him so much.

900
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:57,060
He basically will do anything for him.

901
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:58,759
I see.

902
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:03,748
Dad! Dad! Dad!

903
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:07,652
My gosh, what's wrong?

904
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,054
A man hit me.

905
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:11,242
What did you say?

906
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,632
Who is it? Which jerk hit my son?

907
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,330
You remember his face, right?

908
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,099
-Yes.
-Let's look for him.

909
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,902
Whoever that brat is, he's dead!

910
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,988
Let's go now!

911
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:30,288
-Just who did it?
-Damn it!

912
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:32,777
I'm doomed! What do I do now?

913
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,378
Seriously, what do I do?

914
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,981
Darn it.

915
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,237
Donghyun, it's me. Don't worry, okay?

916
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,931
I have something to talk to you about.

917
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,367
I'll take my hands off,
but you can't scream.

918
00:43:58,314 --> 00:43:59,754
-Dad!
-No!

919
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,140
You said you won't scream!

920
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,809
Just listen to me first.

921
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,812
-What is it?
-Well...

922
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,125
Donghyun, I was wrong.

923
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,618
I'm really sorry.

924
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,424
I sincerely apologize.

925
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,124
So, can you not tell your dad...
no, the coach about everything?

926
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,927
-Why should I?
-Because if you tell the coach,

927
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,730
I might get kicked out.

928
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:29,634
Please let it slide this once. Just once.

929
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:32,643
Fine. But, I have a request.

930
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:33,638
Request?

931
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,048
So, all I need to do is lend you my phone?

932
00:44:37,151 --> 00:44:38,355
I can install games, right?

933
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:40,125
My dad won't let me play games.

934
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:42,713
Sure. Go ahead.

935
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,515
You can even buy items
or anything you want.

936
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:49,187
In exchange,
you won't say anything to the coach?

937
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,088
That depends on how you act.

938
00:44:52,988 --> 00:44:55,793
Sure. I'll be nice. Really nice.

939
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,191
Then, I'll head to practice.

940
00:44:59,928 --> 00:45:01,098
Mister.

941
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,102
Tell me if my dad is heading this way.
Okay?

942
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:08,005
Okay. Just trust me, Donghyun.

943
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:11,108
Donghyun, have fun playing game.

944
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:21,419
Twin... Twin Angel.

945
00:45:21,517 --> 00:45:22,820
Ultra... it's a new product.

946
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,822
It says that it's good
because it has two wings...

947
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,324
The absorption...

948
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,526
It's a new product.

949
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,127
It's on sale.

950
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,029
What do you think you're doing?

951
00:45:33,763 --> 00:45:34,832
Team leader!

952
00:45:34,922 --> 00:45:37,535
Do you think you can sell the allocated
quota by today acting like that?

953
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:42,171
Do you know how many
people want this spot?

954
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,251
We apologize.

955
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,475
Forget it.

956
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,979
Just know that the person with
the least sales will be replaced.

957
00:45:48,073 --> 00:45:49,267
What do you mean?

958
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,358
If I don't sell well,
Suyeon will be fired?

959
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,284
Jeongeun will survive then.

960
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,772
If your sales are bad,
Jeongeun will get fired.

961
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,088
-What?
-Do you understand?

962
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:58,471
No, wait.

963
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:01,092
She's being too much.

964
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,495
Exactly. It's not like
we're in some kind of match!

965
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:07,498
I'm in big trouble now.

966
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,900
I can't let Jeongeun
get fired because of me.

967
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,609
It's a big problem.

968
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,804
That means,
Suyeon could get fired because of me.

969
00:46:17,711 --> 00:46:19,310
It can't be helped.

970
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,213
We don't have a choice,
we just need to do our best.

971
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,315
Well, I guess so.

972
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:27,821
It's Ultra Flower.

973
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,021
Not me, but this product.

974
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:33,907
This absorbs twice as much
as the other products? No.

975
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,898
Then, three times? No.

976
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:37,628
It's five times!

977
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:38,739
Take a look at it.

978
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:40,231
Excuse me, pretty ladies.

979
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,333
New product from Twin Angel.
With two wings!

980
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,548
Not just one, but two!

981
00:46:45,632 --> 00:46:48,239
After you wear it, it doesn't show at all.

982
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:52,343
For Ultra Flower,

983
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:56,647
in addition to five times absorption,
it contains natural charcoal.

984
00:46:56,743 --> 00:47:02,543
Also, it was dermatologically tested in
Germany and obtained the Excellent grade.

985
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:05,373
It has 100 percent natural ingredients,

986
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,094
so it protects your daily life.

987
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,845
Our twin angel, doesn't only have 2 wings.

988
00:47:13,941 --> 00:47:19,518
Made with natural organic air cotton
and protects your skin from irritation.

989
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:23,600
No coloring, pesticides, bleaches,
or super-absorbent polymers.

990
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:26,394
It will protect your health.

991
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:29,180
Yes, welcome. It's twin angel.

992
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:32,299
No, wait. It's Ultra Flower...

993
00:47:34,283 --> 00:47:37,188

1017
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:03,798
"I'm sorry I can't be honest"

1018
00:49:03,973 --> 00:49:05,609
I'm sorry, I couldn't be honest.

1019
00:49:05,703 --> 00:49:08,200
Angel is treating you today.

1020
00:49:08,303 --> 00:49:09,289
What are you treating?

1021
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:12,493
You'll receive a chewy
garlic-favoured sausage,

1022
00:49:13,013 --> 00:49:14,084
"Dawakn Noodles"

1023
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,825
Traditional Chinese style,
Sinchuan Dawakn noodles.

1024
00:49:32,957 --> 00:49:34,438
We can sit together, right?

1025
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,539
Yes, sure.

1026
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,743
Donghyun, enjoy your meal.

1027
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:44,114
Gosh! What's wrong?

1028
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:46,383
Lower your voice.

1029
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,487
Is my dad watching us right now?

1030
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:55,259
I have a favor to ask.

1031
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,802
Help eat the kimchi for me.

1032
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,749
-What?
-I don't like kimchi.

1033
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:09,740
In addition, spinach, bean sprouts...

1034
00:50:09,874 --> 00:50:11,051
It's the worst.

1035
00:50:11,152 --> 00:50:14,655
So, you want me to eat kimchi
and vegetables for you?

1036
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:17,114
Dad will check on me later.

1037
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:19,517
Why? You don't want to?

1038
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:20,217
What?

1039
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,020
No, that's not it. I'll eat them.

1040
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,126
-Just what do you think you're doing?
-What's wrong?

1041
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:32,429
If you take them all at
once, he'll get suspicious.

1042
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,299
Take a little for every spoon of rice.

1043
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,400
Okay?

1044
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:38,802
Okay.

1045
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,513
Are you happy now?

1046
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,415
Yes, good job.

1047
00:50:51,513 --> 00:50:53,150
Then, I'll get up first.

1048
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:00,124
Dad, I've finished eating.

1049
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:03,994
My Donghyun is better than me.

1050
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:05,396
Go and put it over there.

1051
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:07,998
What is it now?

1052
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,374
Meet me at the Coach's
Office in ten minutes.

1053
00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:15,351
My goodness. Donghyun is such a brat!

1054
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,543
This is driving me nuts.

1055
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:22,446
Darn it.

1056
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,829
You've waited long.

1057
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:30,154
To everyone who purchased Ultra Flower,

1058
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:32,232
you'll get 1+1,

1059
00:51:32,353 --> 00:51:36,451
and chewy garlic-flavored sausage.

1060
00:51:36,546 --> 00:51:39,229
Ultra Flower's dinner idea.

1061
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,532
Preserved with salt,

1062
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,540
Andong Mackerel.

1063
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,878
What? You're only giving this much?

1064
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,885
The Angel gentleman
freebies are much better.

1065
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:53,877
Better than Mackerel?

1066
00:51:53,973 --> 00:51:56,680
To those who purchase Twin Angel,

1067
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,682
you'll receive 1+1,

1068
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:04,888
and also a 20 year-old ginseng extract.

1069
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,124
-Give me one.
-Thank you.

1070
00:52:07,209 --> 00:52:10,310
-Please give me one.
-Yes, thank you. Thank you.

1071
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:13,297
-Amazing!
-Thank you very much.

1072
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:15,532
Yes, thank you.

1073
00:52:15,623 --> 00:52:17,334
Come here.

1074
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:18,702
Aren't you being too much?

1075
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,713
-What do you mean?
-Aren't we being too excessive?

1076
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:23,707
Don't you know that we
need to pay for them?

1077
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,609
If this goes on, we're both doomed.

1078
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,326
You started it first.

1079
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,112
Hey,

1080
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,516
what's wrong with you?

1081
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:32,319
Is it because you're worried
Suyeon will get fired?

1082
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,117
Or?

1083
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:35,119
Or else?

1084
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:37,221
Do you like Suyeon?

1085
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,324
-That's not it.
-Then, why are you doing this?

1086
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:42,838
Suyeon is broke,
and her marriage was canceled.

1087
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:45,129
Yet, she's trying to get back on her feet.

1088
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:46,830
How disappointed will she
be if she gets fired again?

1089
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,433
It's the same case for Jeongeun.

1090
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,721
She worked hard for her own
college tuition fees and graduated.

1091
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:53,108
But now, her acting
career is not doing well.

1092
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,406
She does three to four
part-time job a day.

1093
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:58,308
On top of that all,
she even does chauffeur service at night.

1094
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,910
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1095
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,413
So, you give in.

1096
00:53:02,743 --> 00:53:04,227
I can't do that.

1097
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,518
Do you have to go this far?

1098
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:10,621
Do you have to see the end for it?

1099
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:13,042
Okay, I accept.

1100
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,125
Do whatever you want.

1101
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,527
Just wait and see.

1102
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:28,972
What is it now?

1103
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,643
Go and solve these.

1104
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:36,947
What is this?

1105
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,618
"Elementary Math for Higher IQ".

1106
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,687
My dad is going to check on it later.

1107
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:45,389
Why? You don't want to?

1108
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:46,290
What?

1109
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,493
No. I'll do it.

1110
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,095
I'll solve it. That's easy.

1111
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:55,299
In exchange, after you finish
it, I'll forget everything.

1112
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:57,101
Sure. Fine.

1113
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,809
But, this is really the last one.

1114
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:02,206
With condition,
you can't get even one question wrong.

1115
00:54:02,315 --> 00:54:03,902
Everytime I got something wrong,

1116
00:54:03,997 --> 00:54:07,311
-dad won't let me watch "Men on a Mission".
-Men on a Mission?

1117
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:11,480
-Variety show?
-Yes, "Men on a Mission" is my favourite.

1118
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,184
So, make sure you don't
get anything wrong.

1119
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,287
-Do you understand?
-Yes. I'll solve them all.

1120
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,195
Hang in there.

1121
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,603
That brat, seriously!

1122
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,404
My gosh!

1123
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:37,674
Darn it!

1124
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,778
One plus six is...

1125
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:55,793
Just what am I doing?

1126
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,796
I'm solving math problems
for an elementary student.

1127
00:54:58,905 --> 00:55:00,798
What is this mess?

1128
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:07,304
Mister, please help buy coke for me.

1129
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:09,502
Meet me at the same place in ten minutes.

1130
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:11,108
Don't get followed.

1131
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:12,810
This brat seriously!

1132
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,113
Now he's making me buy beverages for him?

1133
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,999
Even if I get kicked out from the team,

1134
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:22,519
this is too much for me.

1135
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:28,125
Kim Donghyun, I'll destroy you!

1136
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:31,195
But how do I revenge him?

1137
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:31,995
"Elementary Math for Higher IQ".

1138
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:33,579
That's right.

1139
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:35,465
That will do, then.

1140
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:37,935
Kim Donghyun,

1141
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,838
you will never watch "Men on a Mission".

1142
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:44,241
One plus one is cutie.

1143
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:47,071
Two plus two is cutie.

1144
00:55:47,155 --> 00:55:50,461
Three plus tie is, gosh it's cutie!

1145
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,250
Four plus four is cutie too.

1146
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,252
This is Twin Angel.

1147
00:55:55,336 --> 00:55:57,832
If you buy now, you'll receive
a box of ginseng extract...

1148
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:00,128
Wait, are you going to buy this?

1149
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:01,825
I heard it has carcinogenic substances.

1150
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:05,028
Really? That was close.

1151
00:56:05,147 --> 00:56:06,837
-Let's go.
Wait a minute.

1152
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:09,432
What do you mean by carcinogenic
substances? Who said that?

1153
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,535
The Ultra Flower guy said so.

1154
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,338
-What?
-Thank you for waiting.

1155
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:18,157
Everyone, up, up!

1156
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:20,441
Okay, Ultra Flower clap! Ready!

1157
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,346
-Hey!
-Start!

1158
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:30,352
Lee Jungi, I heard you said that Twin
Angel has carcinogenic substances?

1159
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,623
I don't know.
I don't remember saying such a thing.

1160
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,027
Don't lie. The ladies all said so.

1161
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,630
Do you know that you've
spread false information?

1162
00:56:39,746 --> 00:56:43,332
-That could lead to legal issue.
-Why would I lie?

1163
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:47,437
Even if I didn't say something like that,
Ultra Flower is still a better product.

1164
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:50,140
-Right?
-Yes.

1165
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,344
Are you looking down on Twin Angel?
When you only have one wing!

1166
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,246
You and your wing!

1167
00:56:56,356 --> 00:56:57,547
I've had it.

1168
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,449
Why would you need it anyway?

1169
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,652
Are you going to fly?
Are you going to become a bird?

1170
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:04,650
Your absorption is not even
as good as Ultra Flower.

1171
00:57:04,735 --> 00:57:06,252
How do you know that?

1172
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,191
Do you have proof that it
absorbs better than mine?

1173
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:10,691
Just forget it.

1174
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:16,062
Just comparing this low product with
Ultra Flower is already a shame.

1175
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,367
Shame?

1176
00:57:17,786 --> 00:57:19,369
Hey, are you done?

1177
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:22,472
Look, an angel is hitting human.

1178
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:24,174
Did you just hit me?

1179
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,078
Yes, I did. Do you have a problem
with that, you Ultra Flower?

1180
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,382
This Twin Angel is too much!

1181
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,184
Seriously!

1182
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:39,456
Excuse me! Angel and Flower are fighting!

1183
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,360
My product absorbs five times better!

1184
00:57:44,592 --> 00:57:45,894
Be careful!

1185
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:50,167
My product has two wings! Two!

1186
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:53,170
That darn wings!

1187
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:55,349
-Stop them.
-Somebody stop them!

1188
00:57:59,485 --> 00:58:00,782
Why don't you look at that.

1189
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:03,280
Such an easy life.

1190
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,882
He gave me so much errand.

1191
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:08,986
And you're here playing ball?

1192
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:13,890
But it's the end of "Men
on a Mission" for you.

1193
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,763
Donghyun!

1194
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:23,367
You startled me. I thought you were dad.

1195
00:58:23,467 --> 00:58:25,268
Why are you so surprised?

1196
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:26,670
Can't Coach see that?

1197
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,174
Dad doesn't want me to play baseball.

1198
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,474
But why?

1199
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:33,272
Dad doesn't want me to have a
hard time with sports like him.

1200
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:35,479
He told me to just focus on studying.

1201
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,081
I like baseball the most in the world.

1202
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,884
You said you love "Men
on a Mission" the most?

1203
00:58:40,996 --> 00:58:43,987
"Men on a Mission" is
second after baseball.

1204
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:46,890
Is that why you practice in secret?

1205
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,993
Yes. One day, I'll become a
pitcher like Park Chan Ho,

1206
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,996
and play in major league.
Just wait and see.

1207
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,298
Why are you smiling?

1208
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,201
Just because...

1209
00:58:58,502 --> 00:58:59,493
...it reminds me to someone.

1210
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:02,102
But have you solved all the question?
Let me see.

1211
00:59:02,186 --> 00:59:03,607
Here you go.

1212
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,093
Wait a minute.

1213
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,813
-Why?
-Well...

1214
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,812
I forgot to check.

1215
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:15,452
I'll give it back to you in a jiff,

1216
00:59:15,536 --> 00:59:17,754
just go ahead and practice.
And drink the coke.

1217
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,445
Okay. Hurry up and come back.

1218
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,258
Okay. Go ahead and practice.

1219
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:34,337
Right. He also dreams of playing
in Major League like me.

1220
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:36,039
I can't be like this to him.

1221
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,644
Kim Donghyun, I will...

1222
00:59:42,226 --> 00:59:45,515
...let you watch "Men on a Mission".

1223
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:51,622
So, you were made a fool by the
Coach's son and made to eat kimchi?

1224
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:52,522
Yes.

1225
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,852
At first, I was angry,
so I wanted to scold him.

1226
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:59,991
But that little kid was
practicing hard on his own.

1227
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:03,472
And he also said that he
wants to be in Major League.

1228
01:00:04,496 --> 01:00:06,590
He's exactly like me when I was younger.

1229
01:00:07,586 --> 01:00:10,107
So, I just ate kimchi for him.

1230
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:13,110
And I even helped solve
the math problems for him.

1231
01:00:13,512 --> 01:00:15,412
You even solve math question?

1232
01:00:15,497 --> 01:00:16,379
You did?

1233
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:17,481
Why?

1234
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,686
Do you think I can't even solve
something simple like that?

1235
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,555
Hey, it was just adding and
subtracting problems for kids.

1236
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:27,763
Do you take me for a fool?

1237
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,264
Zero points? That's impossible.

1238
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,466
He even checked for me.

1239
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,469
Isn't he stupid then?

1240
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:45,008
He will probably remember
me for the rest of his life.

1241
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,178
I'm his life savior. Savior.

1242
01:00:50,965 --> 01:00:53,483
By the way, are they doing well?

1243
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,281
It's not easy.

1244
01:00:55,365 --> 01:00:56,586
That's true.

1245
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,689
It's the team leader.

1246
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,258
Hello.

1247
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:03,260
What?

1248
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:07,964
Are you out of your mind?
How can you fight?

1249
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,079
We're both fired because of you now.

1250
01:01:10,194 --> 01:01:12,569
What are you going to do now? Tell me!

1251
01:01:12,686 --> 01:01:13,870
Well...

1252
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:18,542
This brat kept on spreading lies that Twin
Angel has had carcinogenic substances.

1253
01:01:18,663 --> 01:01:20,648
You were the one who offered
the box of free ginseng extract?

1254
01:01:20,755 --> 01:01:23,947
You offered the chewy
garlic-flavored sausage first.

1255
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:25,649
-That darn wings!
-Stop!

1256
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:27,050
What are you saying right now?

1257
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,618
What did you just do?

1258
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,955
Hey, we're doing all of
this for both of you.

1259
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,646
We're the fools for believing you.

1260
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:36,943
My goodness!

1261
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,930
You can't do anything right. Nothing.

1262
01:01:40,046 --> 01:01:41,246
What an idiot!

1263
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,133
What? Idiot?

1264
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:45,535
They're too much.

1265
01:01:45,646 --> 01:01:49,439
I guess this is why you shouldn't
offer help to desperate people.

1266
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:52,342
Exactly! I won't ever help you again!

1267
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,145
I'm hungry.

1268
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,647
Jungi, let's eat ramyeon.

1269
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:00,111
Sure. But Angel, you'll make it, right?

1270
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,225
Sure, why not.

1271
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,820
-Wooshik, me too!
-Get lost!

1272
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,222
Turn on the TV.

1273
01:02:05,623 --> 01:02:06,623
Darn it.

1274
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:09,226
Gosh, that hurts.

1275
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,828
I was being kind for nothing.

1276
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:17,934
Han Suyeon,
I will never care for you again.

1277
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,337
Hey, Cha Wooshik.

1278
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,943
What do you want now?

1279
01:02:27,528 --> 01:02:29,940
You went through a lot for me today.

1280
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:34,017
You're not even a kid,
why did you two fight?

1281
01:02:34,425 --> 01:02:35,318
Goodness.

1282
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,823
Wait. What are you doing?

1283
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,324
Stay still.

1284
01:03:22,016 --> 01:03:23,133
That's it.

1285
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,770
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1286
01:03:29,483 --> 01:03:31,074
-Choi Wooshik.
-What?

1287
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,077
-What? Why?
-Why are you gawking like that?

1288
01:03:35,499 --> 01:03:38,007
When did I do that? I didn't!

1289
01:03:38,102 --> 01:03:40,317
Gosh, what a joke.

1290
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:46,890
He's mad when I'm being kind to him.

1291
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:53,623
Hello?

1292
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,334
What? Who?

1293
01:03:59,091 --> 01:03:59,992
What?

1294
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,005
-That startled me.
-Oh my!

1295
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:04,507
What's wrong?

1296
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:08,079
Who was it?

1297
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:09,379
My...

1298
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,281
My sister is coming.

1299
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:12,379
What?

1300
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,781
Your sister is coming?

1301
01:04:14,865 --> 01:04:17,153
For real? Yuri?

1302
01:04:57,305 --> 01:04:59,996
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1303
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,923
Do not answer my sister's call.

1304
01:05:02,022 --> 01:05:03,923
Don't talk to her, don't even look at her.

1305
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:06,236
Are you out of your mind?
If not, how could you!

1306
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,938
You need to leave before Wooshik wakes up
tomorrow. Or even I'll get kicked out.

1307
01:05:09,023 --> 01:05:10,627
I have a change of heart.

1308
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:11,741
There are six legs!

1309
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:12,742
Continue what you were doing.

1310
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,311
I still like Suyeon? But why?

1311
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,514
Wooshik! Are you sick?

1312
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,212
No!

1313
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:21,511
What kind of role is it?

1314
01:05:21,595 --> 01:05:23,426
The male lead's stand-in.

1315
01:05:23,513 --> 01:05:25,922
Why put up with all of that
when your face won't even show?

1316
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,125
I may be your stand-in,
but this is just too much...

1317
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,362
Let's have a blast, okay?
