1
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:09,457
Jungi, get up.

2
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:12,546
How could you keep this up for days?

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,623
Come on, get up.

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,492
Are you really going to quit acting?

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,255
I'm getting sick of this.

6
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:29,963
Jungi, get up.

7
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:31,709
Jungi!

8
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:49,412
Slow down. You'll get indigestion.

9
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:52,578
I wish I can but it's
almost time for my shoot.

10
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,044
What are you shooting today?

11
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:56,866
In Paju, there's a turtle
that's faster than a rabbit.

12
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,918
What? A turtle is faster than a rabbit?

13
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,208
Yes. I heard it runs
a 100 meter race in 20 seconds.

14
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,158
20 seconds?

15
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,014
So that turtle is faster than me?

16
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,509
I think so. Even its name
is "Usain Turtle."

17
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:08,412
Wow, that's amazing.

18
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:14,715
Mr. Cha, did you enjoy your breakfast?

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,529
Then I'll see you later at the studio.

20
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:18,891
Why is she texting me in the morning?

21
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,981
Who? Minah?

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,022
Oh, you mean that student of yours?

23
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:25,210
I heard you're her first love.

24
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:29,121
It's not like that.

25
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,793
What do you mean?

26
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,060
I heard she said so herself.

27
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,891
I'm done. I'm going to meet
Usain Turtle now.

28
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,875
- Safe trip.
- See you.

29
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:42,284
Why did you say that in front of Suyeon?

30
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,537
What did I do?

31
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,589
I thought you decided to stay
as friends with Suyeon.

32
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:48,613
I did. But...

33
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:49,708
Whatever. Forget it.

34
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:51,941
Why are you taking it out on me?

35
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,652
Jeongeun, how is Jungi doing?

36
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,675
I don't know. He hasn't said a word.

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,295
What happened to him?

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,877
He'll quit acting? What's that about?

39
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,067
I'm not sure.

40
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,026
But it looks pretty serious.

41
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,587
Just leave him alone for now.

42
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,809
When I got kicked out of my team,
it made it worse when...

43
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:11,962
...someone tried to talk to me.

44
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,961
He may be better off alone
when he's in that state.

45
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,435
But what if he really gives up on acting?

46
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,573
I will find out what's bothering him...

47
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,174
...and make him snap out o fit.

48
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,770
You just woke up?

49
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,294
Yeah. I overslept.

50
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:34,820
Are you going to wash up?

51
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:35,738
Yes.

52
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,959
We're going out on a date today.

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,761
You remember, right?

54
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:43,130
Yes, of course I do.

55
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,661
But...

56
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:47,950
...if it doesn't feel right...

57
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:51,154
...we'll just go back to
the way things were, okay?

58
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,774
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

59
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:54,888
Then I'll see you later.

60
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:55,981
Okay.

61
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:07,341
Gosh, that was awkward.

62
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,780
I couldn't even breathe.

63
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,678
But is this really a good idea?

64
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:23,240
It was already confirmed
that I would take the role.

65
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,297
I was chosen from the audition.

66
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:27,510
So why did you cut me out?

67
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,678
I've spent 10 years as a nameless actor.

68
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,878
I thought of this as my last opportunity.

69
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:33,780
I laid my head on the block and practiced.

70
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,476
Please give me one more chance.
I'm begging you.

71
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:37,852
Please, sir.

72
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:46,826
Hey, Jungi, get up.

73
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,112
I said get up.

74
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:49,772
Leave me alone.

75
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,583
Will you get up?

76
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:53,058
Come on, get up!

77
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,058
Aren't you going to get up?

78
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,968
Why? What is it?

79
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:58,313
Why are you being like this? Tell me.

80
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:00,070
I told you, I don't want
to talk about it.

81
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,928
Hey, you said I'm your best friend.

82
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,894
Best friends don't keep
secrets from each other.

83
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:06,945
Don't you think so?

84
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,751
Fine, then.

85
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,887
I'll tell you my secrets,
and you tell me yours.

86
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,792
I'll start.

87
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,436
Do you remember doing...

88
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,881
..."Romeo and Juliet" back in college?

89
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,059
What about it?

90
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:26,652
During the act, when we were
having our stage kiss...

91
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:29,368
..."Braap!" You heard that sound, right?

92
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,657
I told you that it came
from the audience.

93
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,068
But it was actually the sound of my fart.

94
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,078
I know.

95
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:37,677
You do? How?

96
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,269
It's not like farts just make noises.

97
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,928
Forget it. Just get out.

98
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,148
Fine.

99
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,189
I wasn't going to tell you this.

100
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,515
I'm the only one in the
world who knows this.

101
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,849
But I'll share it with you.

102
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,196
What is it now?

103
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,316
Do you remember when
everyone went crazy...

104
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:02,502
...because there was an erotic movie
playing on the counter?

105
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,959
I was the one who was watching it.

106
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,085
I know.

107
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,183
You know that too?

108
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:09,773
I saw that it was you when I checked
the CCTV to catch the culprit.

109
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:15,363
You were watching it for three hours.
And you were really into it.

110
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,858
No, I wasn't into it.

111
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,117
I was just curious because
it was my first time to watch...

112
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,207
Whatever. Just get out.

113
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,190
Why are you acting like this?

114
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,842
- Just get out.
- Tell me why.

115
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,260
Get out!

116
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,529
Jungi!

117
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,079
Are you really going to be like this?

118
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,192
Then forget everything I said, all right?

119
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,712
You have to forget about the erotic movie.

120
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:41,141
Okay?

121
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,168
You watched an erotic movie?

122
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,878
Which one was it?

123
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,517
What was the title?

124
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:52,096
Oh, shoot...

125
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,221
I would never have thought
I'd go on a date with Yuri.

126
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,708
This is making me a little nervous.

127
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,351
Kibong.

128
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,427
Hey, you're here.

129
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:14,664
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

130
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,810
It's okay, I just got here myself.

131
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:19,395
This is so awkward.

132
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,477
This is making me cringe.

133
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,450
So... what should we do?

134
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:30,259
I don't know. Should we go
to Han River and ride bikes?

135
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,803
I'm wearing a skirt.

136
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:35,977
Then why don't we take
a walk at Han River?

137
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,397
I'm wearing heels.

138
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:39,374
Oh...

139
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:41,172
Then let's go on a cruise.

140
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:43,103
I get seasick.

141
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:47,959
Then, should we go to the arcade?

142
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,879
I don't like games.

143
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,064
How come everything you suggest
is something that I hate?

144
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,486
Then why don't you tell
me what you want to do?

145
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:01,609
Then... should we go watch a movie?

146
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,793
There's a good romantic comedy out.

147
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,870
Romantic comedies are too cheesy for me.

148
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:07,996
Really?

149
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,527
Should we go and chat at a cafe?

150
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,835
Cafes are too noisy for me.

151
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,348
Then how about shopping?

152
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,201
I hate that more than anything.

153
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,103
Then what?

154
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:19,386
You hate everything, too!

155
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,557
What am I supposed to do?
You suggest everything that I hate.

156
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:24,885
Forget it.

157
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:27,748
Let's just go somewhere.

158
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,717
We might end up standing here all day.

159
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:34,888
We just don't match together.

160
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,393
We just don't match from the get-go.

161
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:48,959
My friend Jeongeun likes erotic movies.

162
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,404
When did you start getting into them?

163
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,924
I told you, that was
the first time I watched.

164
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,981
It just came on by pure coincidence.

165
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,502
That's so strange.

166
00:07:57,706 --> 00:08:01,764
What exactly did you click
for an erotic movie to come on?

167
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,088
You'd better stop that.

168
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,570
Okay. I'm just joking around.

169
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,788
But why were you telling Jungi
that you like erotic movies?

170
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:11,845
I just thought he'd tell
me what's wrong...

171
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,776
...if I spill out my own secrets.

172
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,017
That won't work.

173
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:18,004
You should make him open up
naturally over drinks.

174
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:18,922
Drinks?

175
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:26,420
What's with all the beers?
You're not even good at drinking?

176
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,245
I just wanted a drink with my bestie.

177
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,810
Forget it. It's broad daylight.

178
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:33,701
Don't you know that
liquid lunch is the best?

179
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:39,152
Let's have a drink together and
talk about all of our secrets.

180
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,555
Come on, let's drink.

181
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,328
Cheers!

182
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:11,406
Well, we're here. What should we do?

183
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,178
I don't know. You decide.

184
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:16,977
Forget it.

185
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,480
Let's eat something first. I'm hungry.

186
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,468
Whatever.

187
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:22,684
What do you want to eat?

188
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:23,662
Anything.

189
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,916
There's a good blood sausage soup
place around here. Do you want to go?

190
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,662
What? Why would you want to have
blood sausage soup on a first date?

191
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:31,037
Can't you think of something else?

192
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:33,938
Then, how about blood pudding soup?

193
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:34,926
Something else.

194
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,364
Then, how about cabbage soup?
Oh, dried pollack soup!

195
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,790
Why do you keep insisting on soups?

196
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,663
Is soup the only food you know?

197
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,994
Then why don't you choose?

198
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,993
Then let's just have spaghetti somewhere.

199
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:50,890
Spaghetti again? We eat that everyday.

200
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,939
That's worth two bowls
of blood sausage soup.

201
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,639
What about sushi?

202
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,552
Sushi's expensive and
the portion's too small.

203
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:02,220
You can have two bowls of soup
and add on pork cuts for that price.

204
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:03,189
What about steak?

205
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:05,960
That's more expensive
with much less portion.

206
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,840
That's worth two bowls of
blood sausage soup with extra pork cuts...

207
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:10,651
...and an extra platter
of assorted sausages.

208
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,668
Hey, is your mind filled with
thoughts of blood sausages?

209
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:20,024
Never mind. Let's just go to
the food court and order separately.

210
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:21,620
Fine, then!

211
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,384
This just isn't working.

212
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,060
How can we not agree on anything?

213
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,601
It's the worst match ever.

214
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,225
We can't agree on anything.

215
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,661
Fine.

216
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:39,153
I was going to take this to the grave...

217
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,899
...but I'll share it with you.

218
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,744
You don't have to tell me.

219
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,662
No.

220
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,603
I'm going to tell you everything.

221
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:50,316
Why? Because we're besties.

222
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,511
Best friends don't keep
secrets from each other.

223
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,813
Fine. What is it? Tell me.

224
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,124
Jungi...

225
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,487
...I'm actually...

226
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,832
...an erotic movie fanatic.

227
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:06,524
I liked watching erotic movies
since I was a little kid.

228
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,862
I even keep an external drive.

229
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,770
Eight terabytes.

230
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,285
I'll lend it to you sometime.

231
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,808
Because we're besties.

232
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:16,940
I'll pass.

233
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,479
Okay. I don't have any secrets anymore.

234
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:20,996
I told you everything.

235
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,485
So why don't you tell me?

236
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,583
What in the world happened?

237
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,828
- I said I don't want to talk about it.
- Darn it.

238
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:35,409
Fine. I was going to take this one
all the way to the grave.

239
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,213
I will tell you. But, in return...

240
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:41,796
...you have to tell me too.

241
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:47,396
You know what? I actually...

242
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:58,234
He just had to eat
blood sausage soup at the food court.

243
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:00,887
Is he possessed with some kind
of blood sausage ghost?

244
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:04,091
She just had to eat spaghetti.

245
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:06,472
Blood sausage soup is delicious
and full of nutrients.

246
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,161
Why wouldn't she eat it?

247
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,225
What should we do now?

248
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:12,705
I don't know.

249
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:15,654
Should we go there?

250
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,969
Fine, whatever. Let's just do it.

251
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:27,470
Why does she have to throw a tantrum
when we agreed to go?

252
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:35,607
Yuri, the enemies are over there!
Where are you shooting at?

253
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,296
You told me to take care of this side.

254
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,492
Still. Here!

255
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:43,512
We got killed because of you.

256
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,561
I told you, I'm not good at games.

257
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:47,870
And you're not even that good yourself.

258
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:49,654
I'm good when I play on my own.

259
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,301
Yeah. You're the boss. Good for you.

260
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,154
Hey, move over!

261
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,730
I can't grab the ball because of you.

262
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,316
What? That's because you keep rushing.

263
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,545
Forget it. Just keep throwing.
We're running out of time.

264
00:13:11,116 --> 00:13:12,296
Fine.

265
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,440
Are you okay, Yuri?

266
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,075
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

267
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,333
No, I didn't.

268
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:22,067
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Let me see.

269
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:24,281
I'm bleeding!

270
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,690
Why did you jerk your head up like that?

271
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,673
Hey, nobody told you to be so near me.

272
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:31,580
- My nose is bleeding!
- I'm bleeding too!

273
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,346
Gosh, seriously.

274
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,876
We're even out of sync when we play games.

275
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:45,543
Look at us. What is this?

276
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,389
What should we do now?

277
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:52,132
I don't know.

278
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,231
I'm a little hungry from all the moving.
Do you want to eat something?

279
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,239
Whatever.

280
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,130
Here.

281
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,266
Hey, why did you put ketchup on it?

282
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,230
I don't put ketchup on my corn dogs.

283
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:08,148
What?

284
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:10,935
It won't taste like anything
without ketchup.

285
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,482
Do you eat corn dogs to taste the ketchup?

286
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:13,468
Yeah!

287
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,629
Gosh, we can't even agree on corn dogs.

288
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,049
Hey, Kibong.

289
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,831
How do you eat your sweet and sour pork?

290
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,480
Pour or dip?

291
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,398
I pour it.

292
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:29,351
I dip it.

293
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,539
Do you like jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

294
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:33,524
- Jjamppong.
- Jjajangmyeon.

295
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:36,481
Cold noodles in soup or spicy sauce?

296
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:37,398
- Soup.
- Spicy sauce.

297
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,775
Plain fried chicken or spicy?

298
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:40,692
- Plain.
- Spicy.

299
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:43,392
Fish-shaped bun,
from the head or the tail?

300
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:44,309
- Head.
- Tail.

301
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,640
Never mind. Let's forget it.

302
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:53,363
You and I just don't get along.

303
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:54,427
I know.

304
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,238
I didn't think we would
be such a bad match.

305
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,028
What should we do now?

306
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,422
Should we just go home?

307
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:03,069
Yeah, okay.

308
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,503
Where are you going?

309
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,264
- The taxi stand is...
- The bus stop is...

310
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:20,084
Gosh, my head.

311
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:27,501
Wait, why was I sleeping here?

312
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,918
Wooshik, what happened?

313
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:34,215
Oh, our movie fanatic is awake.

314
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,939
What? "Movie fanatic"?

315
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:38,298
You said you're an erotic movie fanatic.

316
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,585
You even keep your collection...

317
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,438
...in an 8TB external
hard, sorted by rating.

318
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,326
What? How did you know that?

319
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,858
You came out here and said so yourself.

320
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:49,247
That you loved erotic movies
since you were little.

321
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:52,985
And that you're even a member
of the "Erotic film lovers' club."

322
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,334
What? I said that too?

323
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:56,890
Yes, you did.

324
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,754
From now on, your nick name is 8TB.

325
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,221
8TB Jeongeun.

326
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:02,674
I must have been crazy.

327
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,623
By the way...

328
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,826
...is what you said earlier really true?

329
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,460
What now? What else did I say?

330
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:10,378
Don't you remember?

331
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:11,865
You once had a crush on Jungi.

332
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,683
What? Wait.

333
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:17,997
I was going to take this one
all the way to the grave.

334
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,001
I'll tell you. But...!

335
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,726
If I tell you this...

336
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,297
...you have to tell me too.

337
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:28,478
You know what...?

338
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,316
Actually, I...

339
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,393
...used to have a crush on you.

340
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:46,397
What? What did you say?

341
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,833
I had a crush on you.

342
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:52,578
I used to think of you as a friend only.

343
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,973
But at some point,
I started seeing you as a man.

344
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,135
But you never understood how I felt.

345
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,112
You're such a jerk.

346
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,827
You jerk!

347
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:10,629
Forget it.

348
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,614
Why did I say that?

349
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,176
Oh, man!

350
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,741
Wooshik, you can't tell anyone. Okay?

351
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:22,949
Too late for that.

352
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,669
You were crying out in tears.

353
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:28,027
Even the lady from the
snack stand came over.

354
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:29,185
The whole neighborhood knows.

355
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,103
What?

356
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:33,205
Oh, jeez. This is crazy.

357
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:34,780
Gosh.

358
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,913
I just wasted my time.
I should've just taken a nap.

359
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,126
I should have just worked.

360
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:49,995
What's the point of this date?

361
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:55,710
Oh, toy vending machine!

362
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,021
There it is.

363
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:05,512
Let me see. Do I have coins?

364
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:07,430
What are you doing?

365
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,776
Let me try this for a second.

366
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:13,483
I have all the figures from
this series except this pawak.

367
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:16,812
Please come out this time.

368
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,178
Pawak, pawak!

369
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,407
What are you, a child?

370
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:26,378
One, two, three...!

371
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:31,355
What? Why isn't it coming out?

372
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:37,611
What do you think you're doing?

373
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:39,890
Why are you sticking your hand in there?

374
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,247
I inserted coins but nothing's coming out.
The machine ate my coins.

375
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,997
What are you talking about?
That has never happened once.

376
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:49,009
Did you insert fake coins?

377
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:50,770
No, I didn't.

378
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,705
Is there proof that you inserted coins?

379
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,244
Is there?

380
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:57,773
You don't have proof? Then just leave.

381
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,277
This machine is expensive.

382
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:02,269
I swear I inserted coins.

383
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:05,177
Let's just go, Yuri.

384
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:08,063
We're not going anywhere.

385
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,083
Sir.

386
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:13,008
I saw him insert coins.

387
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,491
So give him his money back.

388
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:18,411
Why should I believe you?
Do you have proof?

389
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,370
There's proof everywhere.

390
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,235
You can check the dashcam footage...

391
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,131
...from the cars parked around here.

392
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,171
If there is proof,
what are you going to do?

393
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,112
What?

394
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,876
How dare a youngster like you
talk back to me?

395
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:36,164
I'm just telling you what happened.
Why would you bring up age?

396
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:39,745
Can't young people say anything
even if something unfair happens?

397
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,058
- What?
- She's so cool.

398
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:45,328
Then let's have the police check
the CCTVs and the dashcam footage....

399
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:46,913
...from the cars around here.

400
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,736
- She's so smart.
- And if we find proof....

401
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,879
...we will sue you for
extortion and defamation.

402
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,960
- She's so confident.
- We'll also ask for...

403
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:55,134
...compensation for
the emotional distress.

404
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,507
She's so charming.

405
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,021
Should we call the police or not?

406
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:04,981
Fine. I'll give the money back.

407
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:06,574
I will. Here you go.

408
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:09,047
Darn it.

409
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,444
You should've done that earlier.

410
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,803
Here.

411
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,888
Why won't you ever stand up for yourself?

412
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,136
That's why people think you're a pushover.

413
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:30,012
What are you doing? Let's go home already.

414
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:31,077
What...?

415
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,399
Okay. Let's go.

416
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,055
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- What?

417
00:21:01,378 --> 00:21:02,775
Nothing.

418
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,516
My scarf!

419
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,250
That's my favorite scarf.

420
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:12,238
Really? Wait here.

421
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,932
Hey. What are you doing?

422
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,779
You said it's your favorite scarf.

423
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,396
Yuri!

424
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:37,522
He's so dashing.

425
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,116
He's so thoughtful.

426
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,763
He's so considerate.

427
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,264
He's so charming.

428
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:55,932
Here you go.

429
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:58,073
Thanks.

430
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:01,377
Your pants got wet.

431
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,735
It's no big deal. I'll just wash them.

432
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:05,135
Let's go, Yuri.

433
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:23,743
Jungi, are you sleeping?

434
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:26,530
Jungi.

435
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,701
What I said earlier...

436
00:22:28,902 --> 00:22:30,811
...it's all in the past now.

437
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:35,172
It's not like that anymore,
so please don't feel uncomfortable. Okay?

438
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:37,757
Okay. Just get out.
I'm tired.

439
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:41,260
Hey, I told you all my secrets.

440
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:43,086
Aren't you going to tell
me what this is about?

441
00:22:43,171 --> 00:22:45,521
Just leave me alone.

442
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,781
Fine, forget it.

443
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,171
Best friends, my foot.

444
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,540
You're not my friend anymore.

445
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,888
Let go.

446
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,244
Do you really have to know?

447
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,926
Yes, I do.

448
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,205
I can't help you unless you
tell me what the problem is.

449
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,639
After hearing it,
you have to leave me alone.

450
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:10,676
Fine. Just tell me.

451
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,649
It's about the movie audition...

452
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,172
...I recently passed.

453
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,048
What about it?

454
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,264
It turns out...

455
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:26,217
....that I was casted because
Hyunseong asked the director.

456
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,566
Really?

457
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,446
But it has nothing to do with you.

458
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:32,619
You didn't know about it.

459
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,015
I did.

460
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,441
I knew about it,
but I thought it was okay...

461
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,667
...because everyone else does that too.

462
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:45,393
I ignored the fact because
I wanted the opportunity so badly.

463
00:23:46,032 --> 00:23:47,798
But someone came to the director.

464
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:50,799
- Who?
- The person who originally got that part.

465
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:53,902
He said it was unfair, crying.

466
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:57,962
He begged the director to tell
him why he lost his part.

467
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:02,515
Just like I did in the past.

468
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,147
After losing my part to Hyunseong,
I was devastated.

469
00:24:06,594 --> 00:24:09,477
And I did the same to that man...

470
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,953
...when I know how painful
and frustrating it is...

471
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:16,512
...more than anyone else.

472
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:18,860
Still...

473
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:21,950
...it doesn't mean you
have to quit acting.

474
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,493
It was just a mistake.

475
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:25,512
A mistake?

476
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,762
But I can't forgive
myself for that mistake.

477
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,573
I don't deserve to be an actor.

478
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,960
Are you happy now?

479
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:36,145
Can you please leave now?

480
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,511
I'm tired.

481
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,898
Is this it for Yuri and me?

482
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:56,388
She probably thinks she and
I have nothing in common.

483
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:59,511
Is this the end for Kibong and me?

484
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:04,761
Kibong probably thinks he and
I have nothing in common.

485
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,438
What a nice breeze.

486
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,855
Yes.

487
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,285
I like walking at night and
enjoying the breeze too.

488
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,107
You do? At least we have
one thing in common.

489
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:22,423
I guess.

490
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,366
Hey, Yuri.

491
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,384
I only like cool breezes like this.

492
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,202
I don't like strong winds
that make me cold.

493
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:35,774
What about you?

494
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,074
What?

495
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,618
I don't like that either.

496
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:40,536
Really?

497
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:43,217
We have another thing in common.

498
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:45,646
How about when it's hot?

499
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,594
I really hate it when it's
scorching hot and I get all sweaty.

500
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,464
- What about you?
- Me too.

501
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,626
Then Kibong, what about this?

502
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,796
I really hate freezing cold weather
with temperature of minus 30 degrees.

503
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,258
- What about you?
- This is amazing.

504
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:00,062
I really hate it when it's cold too.

505
00:26:00,146 --> 00:26:02,698
Do you get hungry too
if you don't eat for two days?

506
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:03,987
Of course.

507
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,267
You too? I just got goosebumps.

508
00:26:07,144 --> 00:26:11,257
Wow, I thought you and I had
nothing in common.

509
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:12,807
But we do have many things in common.

510
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:13,892
I know.

511
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:15,925
Yuri.

512
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:21,082
Should we try dating
each other a little more?

513
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,741
For another week, maybe?

514
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,102
Shall we?

515
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:29,133
But is one week going to be enough?

516
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:33,094
Don't you think we should
date for about a month...

517
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:36,231
...to see if we're right for each other?

518
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:38,214
You're right.

519
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:43,578
So, is this our first day...

520
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,802
...of dating?

521
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,419
I guess so.

522
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:49,953
Now that we're a couple...

523
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,165
...can I hold your hand?

524
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:54,746
Well...

525
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,498
...I guess you can.

526
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,892
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

527
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:41,996
Did you sleep well, Yuri?

528
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,636
Yes. Did you sleep well?

529
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:45,554
Yes.

530
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:49,020
I hate that I ran into you.
I haven't even washed my face.

531
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:51,341
- This is embarrassing.
- You're pretty.

532
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,293
What?

533
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:55,197
You look pretty even if
you don't wash your face.

534
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,273
What the heck was that?
It makes me cringe.

535
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,326
Why? It's true that you're pretty.

536
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,617
Stop it. You must be crazy.

537
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:03,466
I am crazy.

538
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:07,121
Crazy about you.

539
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,752
Oh, my. What's wrong with you?

540
00:28:09,836 --> 00:28:12,851
I was just kidding. Stop hitting me.

541
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:14,565
- You're so cute.
- Out of the way!

542
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:20,251
- What's up with her?
- I know.

543
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:21,909
What's wrong with her
so early in the morning?

544
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,222
Jungi, get up.

545
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,225
What is it this time?

546
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,229
You said you won't bother me anymore.

547
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:29,844
I need to take you somewhere.
Get up already!

548
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,090
Go where? I'm tired. Get out.

549
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:34,907
I said, get up!

550
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,988
Is that how you want to play it? Okay.

551
00:28:41,873 --> 00:28:44,648
What's the matter with you?
Just leave me be!

552
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:47,820
Come with me. Now.

553
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:53,466
Hurry up!

554
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,285
Why are we here?

555
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,416
Just follow me.

556
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,395
What is this about?

557
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:00,664
What?

558
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:09,853
- Hey, what are you...
- Jungi.

559
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:13,459
Before you think about
forgiving yourself...

560
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:17,644
...shouldn't you ask him
for forgiveness first?

561
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:19,966
I think that's the right thing to do.

562
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,641
I'll be waiting outside.

563
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:26,464
Hey, Jeongeun. Jeongeun.

564
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,856
Excuse me.

565
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,286
Who are you?

566
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:46,669
Hello.

567
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:48,814
My name is Lee Jungi.

568
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,863
Yes, how can I help you?

569
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:52,780
Well...

570
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:56,116
...the thing is...

571
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,562
So that's what happened.

572
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:04,701
I'm really sorry.

573
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:08,118
It's late, but I wanted to come clean...

574
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,323
...and ask for your forgiveness.

575
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,113
To be honest, I do feel angry.

576
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:15,754
But I don't know if I have
the right to forgive you.

577
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:18,793
Pardon? What do you mean?

578
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:21,224
If I received the same offer...

579
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:23,196
...would I have been able to refuse?

580
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:27,447
I'm not sure if I would've
said no to that.

581
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:31,962
Still, I'm sorry.

582
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:34,037
Please forgive me.

583
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,541
If it's really that important,
then I forgive you.

584
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:42,148
But I can't forgive you for giving up
acting over something like this.

585
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:44,348
- Pardon?
- Jungi.

586
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:48,083
We don't act to become stars, are we?

587
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:51,010
We just enjoy and love acting.

588
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,496
Isn't that why we want to do it?

589
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,991
If you give up on something
you love because of what happened...

590
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,960
...isn't that being too harsh on yourself?

591
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:02,861
Or is it because you don't like
acting as much as I do?

592
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:06,408
No, I like acting.

593
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:09,393
I love acting.

594
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,572
Then I forgive you.

595
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:14,644
In return, I have just one request.

596
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:17,893
A request?

597
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:22,750
"Sunshine Theater"

598
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:25,801
Jungi, how did it go?

599
00:31:27,198 --> 00:31:29,271
I told him the truth and he forgave me.

600
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,859
Really? That's great.

601
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,208
So what are you going to do now?

602
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:36,144
Are you really going to quit acting?

603
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,665
I was going to quit.

604
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:41,184
But there's an unexpected outcome.

605
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,868
- What outcome?
- In return for forgiving me...

606
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:45,854
...he wants me to perform
in a play with him.

607
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,278
He has a play coming up...

608
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:49,405
...but his colleague was hospitalized
and one spot is empty.

609
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,960
So? Will you do it?

610
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:54,249
I have no choice.
He'll only forgive me if I do it.

611
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,831
I'm going to do it so
I can go back to the basics.

612
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:02,123
I think I lost sight of why
I wanted to act in the first place.

613
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:04,325
I got greedy because
I wanted to be a star...

614
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,428
...and lost sight of what's important.

615
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:12,054
Back in college, we built our own stage.

616
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,317
We had so much fun even
when there was no audience.

617
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:17,068
I'm going to start over.
Just like I did back in the day.

618
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,794
Good thinking.

619
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,393
Thank you. I owe it to you.

620
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,769
I feel so reassured with
my best friend next to me.

621
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:27,310
See? You better be good to me.

622
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:28,613
Okay.

623
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:30,131
Let's go, my friend.

624
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:32,074
I'm buying tteokbokki today.

625
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,455
- Okay.
- Oh, right.

626
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:36,640
There was something I wanted to ask you.

627
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:38,226
Can you tell me...

628
00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:41,363
...why you liked me so much?

629
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:44,209
- What?
- You said you used to like me.

630
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:45,959
So what is about me
that you liked so much?

631
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,225
It was a long time ago.
I don't like you now.

632
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,563
Then, when you saw me back then...

633
00:32:50,648 --> 00:32:52,735
...did you get nervous
and blush and stuff?

634
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:54,962
- Stop it.
- Why?

635
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:56,499
Does it make you embarrassed...

636
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,763
...and does your heart bounce
just by thinking about it?

637
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:00,836
Come here, you're dead meat.

638
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,796
- What?
- Come here.

639
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:06,142
Did your heart really bounce?
Bounce, bounce, bounce!

640
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:07,471
Hey!

641
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:17,215
Gongguri, what are you to me?

642
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,267
I'm just a lowly clown, Your Majesty.

643
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:23,603
No. You are my friend.

644
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,125
A man who is my friend.

645
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,078
In short, is it "male friend"?

646
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,483
No, Your Majesty.
How could I dare...

647
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,399
All right, enough with the chat.

648
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:34,439
- Let me see your dance now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

649
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,992
♪ Nakyang, Dongcheon, Ehwajeong

650
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,268
Wait, Jungi.

651
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:54,779
What's wrong?

652
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,743
Your dancing seems kind of awkward.

653
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:02,609
Actually, I was busy lately
and I didn't get much practice.

654
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:04,233
I'm really sorry, sir.

655
00:34:04,317 --> 00:34:05,430
It's okay.

656
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,166
We have a lot of time
until the performance.

657
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:08,809
You can work on it.

658
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:12,259
Why don't we call it a day
and go get a drink?

659
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,192
A drink?

660
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,682
I don't drink these days.

661
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,991
- Really? Why?
- Why?

662
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,263
Because I want to focus on my acting.

663
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:24,847
Too bad, then.

664
00:34:25,172 --> 00:34:26,034
I'll see you tomorrow.

665
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,350
Okay. Goodbye, sir.

666
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,008
I can't stand this anymore.

667
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:36,749
What do I do?

668
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:53,140
Oh, no. You got hemorrhoids again.

669
00:34:53,683 --> 00:34:55,963
Why didn't you come earlier?

670
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,165
I...

671
00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:00,976
...just had some things
going on in my life...

672
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:03,142
...so I've been drinking a lot.

673
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:05,965
But, Doctor. Is it that serious?

674
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,708
Serious is an understatement.

675
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,845
At this rate...

676
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,956
...you'll end up getting
an artificial anal sphincter.

677
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,686
An artificial sphincter?

678
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,443
Doctor, what can I do?

679
00:35:17,528 --> 00:35:19,515
I'll prescribe you some ointment.

680
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:22,358
Do not forget to apply it regularly.

681
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:25,309
Don't forget to take a sitz bath
three times a day.

682
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,264
Do you understand?

683
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:27,936
Yes, doctor.

684
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:31,832
I'm so tired.

685
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:34,237
I should get a cold glass of water...

686
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,628
I guess she's really tired.

687
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,598
What if she catches cold?

688
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:15,275
Wooshik.

689
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,193
Did I wake you?

690
00:36:17,366 --> 00:36:18,654
I just came to get some water.

691
00:36:18,738 --> 00:36:20,294
Oh, I see.

692
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:25,026
How did this...?

693
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,055
I was just...

694
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:31,058
...worried that you'd catch a cold.

695
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,744
- Thanks.
- It's nothing, really.

696
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:36,791
You should go in and get some sleep.

697
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:40,423
I want to. But I have so much
to prepare for the shoot.

698
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,755
I should get some coffee.

699
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,824
Coffee? I'll make you some.
You just take a rest.

700
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:48,314
It's fine. I can make my own coffee.

701
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,859
Don't worry.

702
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:51,679
I was going to have some, anyway.

703
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:52,734
Wait here.

704
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:10,165
- Careful!
- Careful.

705
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:12,666
Gosh, that was heavy.

706
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:17,776
I said I'd carry it for you.

707
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,706
It's all right. It's too much
to carry on your own.

708
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,146
Good job today, Kibong.

709
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,556
I didn't do anything.

710
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,533
You were the one who did
a great job cooking all day.

711
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:28,381
You and your sweet talks.

712
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,466
Come on.

713
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:31,303
Come on. Wait a minute.

714
00:37:31,388 --> 00:37:32,221
Why?

715
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,321
You're sweating.

716
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,998
- Here, too.
- Here, too.

717
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:37,789
And here, too.

718
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:39,606
What's going on?

719
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:43,678
What are you two doing?

720
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,970
Gross.

721
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:49,970
Why do you sweat so much? You stink.

722
00:37:50,412 --> 00:37:52,016
Clean it all up, okay?

723
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,440
Okay, Yuri.

724
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:58,526
Why are you picking on Kibong?

725
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,962
She's my sister,
but her temper's unbelievable.

726
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,016
Kibong, just leave it.

727
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,330
It's okay.

728
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,878
You're just too nice.

729
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:10,651
Darn it!

730
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:13,534
I'm home.

731
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:16,231
You're late.

732
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,428
The practice session ran late.

733
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,817
What's up with that look?

734
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,570
It's not going well as I expected.

735
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,046
I'm going to my room.

736
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:32,690
Is he still feeling depressed?

737
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,347
I don't think so.

738
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:36,686
Jeongeun told me that he's fine now.

739
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,822
That's weird.

740
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:47,227
My butt...

741
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:51,106
I should get some ointment on.

742
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,600
"Hemorrhoids Ointment"

743
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:54,564
Hold on.

744
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,253
Gosh.

745
00:38:57,953 --> 00:39:01,119
They're going to make so much fun
of me if they find out about this.

746
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:02,621
What do I do?

747
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:05,835
I should lock the door first.

748
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:18,415
What is that noise?

749
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:31,931
Huh? Is he crying?

750
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,672
What's wrong with him?

751
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:37,379
It hurts.

752
00:39:37,998 --> 00:39:40,580
My butt hurts so much that I can't sleep.

753
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:42,083
Hold on.

754
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:44,880
What if I really end up getting
an artificial sphincter?

755
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:48,225
That can't happen.

756
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:59,849
What? Jungi was up crying
in the middle of the night?

757
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:01,045
That's what I'm telling you.

758
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:03,851
He was crying so hard
that I couldn't even to talk to him.

759
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:07,263
But Jungi was okay.
Maybe it's something else?

760
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:09,100
Do you think it's because of his acting?

761
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,418
Jungi said yesterday
that the practice didn't go well.

762
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,846
That might be it.

763
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:14,757
He's been trying really hard...

764
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:17,382
...but if it doesn't work out,
he could be distressed.

765
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:19,056
Maybe...

766
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:20,501
...he has depression?

767
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:22,074
What? Depression?

768
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:25,171
I don't think depression fits him, though.

769
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,747
How would you know?

770
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:29,727
Even the brightest person
can get depression.

771
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:33,517
It's an illness of the mind,
so it's not easy to notice it.

772
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:36,632
Depression is a scary thing.
This is not good.

773
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,192
Are you up, Jungi?

774
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:42,317
How about breakfast?

775
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,225
I don't feel like eating.

776
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:46,925
I'll just have a glass of water.

777
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:56,993
What do we do?

778
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,875
It seems like he doesn't want to eat.

779
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,528
Do you really think it's depression?

780
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:04,634
Hello.

781
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,610
Why are you here so early in the morning?

782
00:41:07,888 --> 00:41:11,506
I was practicing but it didn't go so well.

783
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,459
Can you help me?

784
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,276
Sure. Let's go.

785
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,628
Kibong. Don't you think...

786
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:27,049
...Minah still likes Wooshik?

787
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:28,349
What are you talking about?

788
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:31,056
She keeps making excuses to come over.

789
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,060
And the way she looks at him
seems a bit suspicious.

790
00:41:34,226 --> 00:41:35,430
Don't you think so, Suyeon?

791
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:36,804
What?

792
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:40,133
I'm not really sure.

793
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,319
I'll be in my room for a break.

794
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:48,108
What's wrong with her?

795
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,135
That's fishy.

796
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:51,798
What about Suyeon?

797
00:41:51,883 --> 00:41:55,327
As soon as Minah got here,
she suddenly seemed to be in a bad mood.

798
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:59,211
Maybe she doesn't like it when
Wooshik and Minah are together.

799
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,487
What are you talking about?

800
00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:02,620
Suyeon doesn't even like Wooshik.

801
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:03,977
Why wouldn't she like it?

802
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:05,565
Do you think so?

803
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:16,330
How long do I have to keep
drinking only water?

804
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,349
But I can't eat food.

805
00:42:19,794 --> 00:42:22,631
I'll be suffering from pain
when I go to the toilet.

806
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:26,714
I'll just put some ointment on.

807
00:42:38,827 --> 00:42:40,196
I should close the curtains as well.

808
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,396
I can't let anyone see.

809
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,377
Why isn't this moving?

810
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,059
It's stuck.

811
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:07,668
Why is it...

812
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:14,233
Kibong!

813
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,937
- Kibong!
- What's that noise?

814
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:17,235
That sounds like Jungi.

815
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:18,264
Let's go and see.

816
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:23,767
Why is the door locked?

817
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,477
Kibong! Please save...

818
00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:29,861
- Kibong, save me...!
- Jungi! What's wrong?

819
00:43:30,476 --> 00:43:31,768
Lee Jungi! Open the door!

820
00:43:31,853 --> 00:43:33,084
Jungi go bye bye...

821
00:43:33,168 --> 00:43:35,212
Kibong, just break it open!

822
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:36,155
Okay.

823
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,409
Jungi!

824
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:45,690
Jungi, what the hell were you doing?

825
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,719
- Are you crazy?
- What?

826
00:43:47,804 --> 00:43:50,343
You said you were fine.
You said you were over it!

827
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,391
What do you think you're doing?

828
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:52,820
What are you talking about?

829
00:43:52,904 --> 00:43:55,203
- It's not what you think.
- You're lying.

830
00:43:55,443 --> 00:43:56,775
How could you do this...?

831
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,810
Do what?

832
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:01,607
What are you guys thinking?

833
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:03,759
It's not what you think!
I was trying to draw the curtains...

834
00:44:03,843 --> 00:44:05,898
...and it got caught around my neck.

835
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,015
Then why did you lock your door? Why?

836
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:13,241
I was just...

837
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,258
...doing something.

838
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,482
Doing what? Tell us.

839
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:18,922
It's just...

840
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:20,293
I...

841
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:22,546
Why can't you tell us? Why?

842
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:27,267
It's really not what you're thinking!

843
00:44:29,685 --> 00:44:31,610
What? Jungi?

844
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:32,651
Are you serious?

845
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:34,070
It's true.

846
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,457
I thought he was okay.

847
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,077
Why is he at it again?

848
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,691
What could be making him so depressed?

849
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:44,863
Kibong will stay with him all the time.

850
00:44:44,957 --> 00:44:46,286
Don't worry too much.

851
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,049
I'd like to make some coffee
for Wooshik. Where is it?

852
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,719
Coffee? I'll make it for you.
Just a second.

853
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,746
It's okay. I can do it.

854
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,793
You're still our guest.
I can't let you do that.

855
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,383
We have some citron tea too.
Do you want some?

856
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,656
Yes, thank you.

857
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:06,906
Give me a second.

858
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:14,568
Why won't it open?

859
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:18,384
The lid must be stuck.

860
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:19,809
Should I try?

861
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:22,355
Well, no. I can do it.

862
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:29,628
Minah, I'm sorry.

863
00:45:29,772 --> 00:45:30,909
Suyeon!

864
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:33,704
It opened so suddenly.

865
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:36,086
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

866
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:39,374
Don't worry. I'm okay.

867
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:41,449
You must have been startled.
Are you really okay?

868
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,743
Try putting some ice on it.

869
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:45,619
Okay.

870
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:48,565
I'm sorry.

871
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:52,185
Why did I make such a mistake?

872
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,444
Was it really a mistake?

873
00:45:57,782 --> 00:45:59,075
What do you mean?

874
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:03,581
It's strange that the lid popped
open right at that moment.

875
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:04,541
What?

876
00:46:05,511 --> 00:46:07,827
Are you saying I did that on purpose?

877
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,671
- Why would I do that?
- I wouldn't know.

878
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:14,474
It really was a mistake.

879
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:23,010
Hey. Why would you say such a thing?

880
00:46:23,094 --> 00:46:26,278
I mean, it can't be just a coincidence.

881
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:28,182
- Don't you think so?
- Watch what you say.

882
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,424
You're being absurd.

883
00:46:30,508 --> 00:46:33,147
I'm not sure. It's a little suspicious.

884
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:44,511
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

885
00:46:44,797 --> 00:46:48,041
I need to put on ointment.
Why isn't he leaving me?

886
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:52,125
Why are you doing this?

887
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:54,724
I told you, it was a misunderstanding.

888
00:46:55,118 --> 00:46:58,151
Just tell me why,
and I'll leave you alone.

889
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:00,086
The thing is...

890
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:03,708
Gosh, should I just tell him?

891
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,679
But then they'll make fun
at me until the day I die.

892
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:10,038
They teased me so much last time
that it pissed me off.

893
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:13,931
I'd rather get an artificial sphincter...

894
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,309
...then telling them.

895
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:18,653
What is it? Tell me.

896
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:20,990
Forget it. Think whatever you want.

897
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:23,429
Aren't you going to work today?

898
00:47:23,514 --> 00:47:24,957
Work is not the problem here.

899
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:28,681
We're taking the day off because
of you, so don't worry.

900
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:32,750
This is driving me crazy.

901
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:35,362
Gosh.

902
00:47:35,863 --> 00:47:37,794
- Where are you going?
- It's none of your business.

903
00:47:37,972 --> 00:47:38,865
I'm coming with you.

904
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:45,496
- What are you doing?
- What?

905
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:46,650
Go ahead and do your thing.

906
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:48,254
I can't when you're watching me.

907
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,956
We're friends. We go to saunas together.

908
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,203
Just relax and do your thing.

909
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:53,624
Do you have to do this?

910
00:47:53,709 --> 00:47:57,442
Yes. I'm not leaving you for a second.

911
00:47:57,873 --> 00:47:59,640
Darn it.

912
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:02,645
Get out of my way.

913
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,086
Where are you going? Wait for me.

914
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,732
I wonder if Jungi is okay.

915
00:48:10,816 --> 00:48:14,050
Kibong is with him.
You don't have to worry.

916
00:48:14,134 --> 00:48:15,739
That's why I'm worried.

917
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:17,640
Kibong is pretty stupid.

918
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,484
Hey. What's so bad about being stupid?

919
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,152
He's a nice guy.

920
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:24,945
He's loyal and responsible.

921
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:28,470
Are you really smart
enough to call him stupid?

922
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:30,298
I didn't meant it like that.

923
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:32,211
But why are you upset?

924
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:36,153
What? I'm not. I'm not upset at all.

925
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:41,087
Yuri, what's that?

926
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:42,489
This?

927
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:46,012
You can stretch your back
and shoulders with this.

928
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:47,560
I see.

929
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:50,001
I've been feeling a bit
stiff in the back lately.

930
00:48:50,085 --> 00:48:51,656
Can I give it a try?

931
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,466
Sure. Here you go.

932
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,541
This is quite nice.

933
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:02,910
Right? Try to stretch it even more.

934
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:04,047
Okay.

935
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:07,497
This feels so good.

936
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:09,606
Do you have a phone charger...?

937
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:19,483
Minah, how long have you been
standing here? Are you okay?

938
00:49:20,295 --> 00:49:21,473
Suyeon.

939
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,059
I let go of the band by mistake.

940
00:49:25,143 --> 00:49:26,926
How could you let go...

941
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:28,568
...just at that moment?

942
00:49:28,653 --> 00:49:29,814
It really was a mistake.

943
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:31,057
I swear.

944
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:33,439
I'm sorry, Minah.

945
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:35,854
Don't worry. It's okay.

946
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:37,304
My goodness.

947
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:40,289
Follow me. Let me put some ice on it.

948
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:41,733
It's okay.

949
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:44,174
I feel too bad. Come with me.

950
00:49:44,454 --> 00:49:46,713
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

951
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:51,336
Yuri, are you still not suspicious?

952
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,560
How could she slap Minah
not just once but twice?

953
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,097
No way. I'm not sure.

954
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:05,236
Gosh.

955
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:07,974
I can't believe they tied up my arms.

956
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,811
I can't put on any ointment
or take a sitz bath.

957
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:15,108
What if I really end
up getting an artificial sphincter?

958
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:21,277
They seem to be fast asleep.

959
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,586
Should I untie my arms
and go take a sitz bath?

960
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:41,293
Why can't I untie it?

961
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,866
It's tied up so tight.

962
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,746
Oh, man!

963
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:00,645
I'll take a sitz bath
before they wake up...

964
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:03,562
...and pretend nothing happened.

965
00:51:04,057 --> 00:51:04,894
Okay.

966
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:09,314
Oh, this is nice.

967
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:10,803
It's perfect.

968
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:13,162
All right. I should hurry up.

969
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:30,168
What? Where did he go?

970
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:31,903
Wooshik, wake up.

971
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:33,779
What? What's the matter?

972
00:51:33,864 --> 00:51:35,087
Jungi disappeared.

973
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:37,377
Really? That brat...

974
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,827
Let's hurry up and look for him.

975
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:39,865
Okay.

976
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:49,875
Isn't that Jungi?

977
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:51,410
I think so.

978
00:51:57,105 --> 00:51:58,613
Jungi, what are you doing in there?

979
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,553
Gosh, why are they awake?

980
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,662
What are you doing in there?

981
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:07,217
What else would I do in the bathroom?

982
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:09,061
Then why were you moaning?

983
00:52:09,304 --> 00:52:10,724
What's going on?

984
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,532
Open the door right now,
or we'll break it down.

985
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,170
No, it's not what you think it is.

986
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:18,536
Yeah, right.

987
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,569
Kibong, let's just break it down.

988
00:52:21,653 --> 00:52:23,328
Guys, stop! No!

989
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:25,405
No! Stop!

990
00:52:26,919 --> 00:52:28,009
What are you doing?

991
00:52:28,093 --> 00:52:29,944
Why didn't you open the door?

992
00:52:30,162 --> 00:52:32,685
Why are you standing up?

993
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,590
I'm done.

994
00:52:35,813 --> 00:52:37,417
- I was just going out.
- Hold on.

995
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:40,408
What's that? Why did you
fill that basin with water?

996
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:45,865
- I just wanted to wash my face.
- Is that so?

997
00:52:46,016 --> 00:52:47,644
Why didn't you just use the sink?

998
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:48,561
Well, you know...

999
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:51,088
...my mom washed me in
a basin when I was little.

1000
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:53,539
Really? Then go on.

1001
00:52:55,093 --> 00:52:56,842
We'll stand here and watch.

1002
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:00,639
All right.

1003
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:05,985
Hey, why are you throwing away that water?

1004
00:53:07,343 --> 00:53:09,833
Well, it's already cold.

1005
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:11,901
I'll fill it with some warm water.

1006
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:13,908
That's a waste of water.

1007
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:15,021
I'll use it.

1008
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:18,437
I'm wide awake thanks to you.
I might as well wash my face.

1009
00:53:18,522 --> 00:53:19,386
No!

1010
00:53:20,154 --> 00:53:21,830
Do you have to wash
your face with this water?

1011
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:23,814
- It's not warm anymore.
- It's okay.

1012
00:53:23,898 --> 00:53:25,337
I like lukewarm water better.

1013
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:28,474
Well, then let me wash my face.

1014
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:31,154
Hey. Just don't.

1015
00:53:31,238 --> 00:53:32,940
You can't wash your face with this water.

1016
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:34,839
It's really okay.

1017
00:53:34,924 --> 00:53:37,716
Hey! No! Stop!

1018
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,457
You can't wash your face with this water.

1019
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,276
What's your problem? It's just water.

1020
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,022
- What are you guys doing?
- Let me go.

1021
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:44,541
- No, please don't.
- This feels good.

1022
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,006
No, please...

1023
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:48,094
This feels nice.

1024
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:53,977
What? Hemorrhoids?

1025
00:53:54,445 --> 00:53:56,602
So it wasn't what we had in mind?

1026
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:58,422
You were trying to apply ointment...

1027
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,869
...so you locked the door
and closed the curtains?

1028
00:54:00,954 --> 00:54:02,721
And the curtain suddenly got
wrapped around your neck?

1029
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,425
Yeah.

1030
00:54:05,048 --> 00:54:05,878
Of course.

1031
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:08,453
Your butt didn't last
because you fart all the time.

1032
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,370
Hang on.

1033
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,450
Then you used that water in the basin...

1034
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:13,672
...for a sitz bath?

1035
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:14,653
Yes.

1036
00:54:14,737 --> 00:54:16,928
What are you talking about?
What is a sitz bath?

1037
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:18,828
Well, it's...

1038
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:24,795
What?

1039
00:54:25,283 --> 00:54:28,359
Are you telling me that Jungi dipped
his butt in that water?

1040
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,203
You should've told me earlier, you idiot!

1041
00:54:32,066 --> 00:54:34,135
Oh, gross! Darn it.

1042
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,368
Sorry.

1043
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:38,630
I couldn't tell you because
you'd make fun of me.

1044
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:42,916
And you must not tell
this to the girls, okay?

1045
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:44,472
Whatever, you idiot!

1046
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,685
I better go wash my hands.

1047
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:47,916
I'm sorry.

1048
00:54:50,932 --> 00:54:52,441
- Wooshik.
- Yeah?

1049
00:54:52,525 --> 00:54:53,694
I have a favor to ask you.

1050
00:54:53,778 --> 00:54:55,261
Okay, what is it?

1051
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:57,131
Can you apply this on me?

1052
00:54:58,029 --> 00:54:59,024
Here.

1053
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,400
It's so tough doing it alone.

1054
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:06,064
Why aren't you sticking
next to Jungi today?

1055
00:55:06,148 --> 00:55:08,240
What? Well...

1056
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,776
...it was all a misunderstanding.

1057
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:12,576
Jungi is okay now. Don't worry about him.

1058
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,016
Really? I'm so relieved.

1059
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,249
What was the matter with him?

1060
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:18,298
What?

1061
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:21,086
It's nothing, so don't worry.

1062
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:25,217
Kibong, since we're finished,
shall we go open the food truck?

1063
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:28,098
Okay. You can go wait first.
I'll move the luggage.

1064
00:55:28,182 --> 00:55:29,680
No, I'll help you.

1065
00:55:29,764 --> 00:55:32,488
It's too heavy for you.

1066
00:55:33,003 --> 00:55:34,687
It's fine, I'm strong too.

1067
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:36,083
I'm stronger than you.

1068
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,303
No, you're not.

1069
00:55:38,474 --> 00:55:40,070
What are you two doing?

1070
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:43,094
You guys look like you're
in love or something.

1071
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,452
I know.

1072
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:46,721
You two are acting
strange since yesterday.

1073
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:48,645
Hey, you're mistaken.

1074
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:52,785
Kibong, get the sauce container
and come outside. Okay?

1075
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:54,664
Oh, okay.

1076
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,669
I'm so full.

1077
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:00,417
I'll see you later then.

1078
00:56:03,337 --> 00:56:05,237
Let's get to work.

1079
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:06,527
See you.

1080
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:10,853
There's definitely something
different about those two.

1081
00:56:10,937 --> 00:56:12,584
I think so too.

1082
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:16,682
By the way, where is Wooshik?

1083
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:18,216
Minah came by this morning...

1084
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,384
...and they're practicing
in the third floor studio.

1085
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:23,782
I see.

1086
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:25,782
Why?

1087
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,553
Does it bother you?

1088
00:56:28,258 --> 00:56:30,387
I told you it doesn't.
What's wrong with you?

1089
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:33,028
I was just asking.

1090
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:35,669
I better go see Jungi.

1091
00:56:40,876 --> 00:56:42,784
Why does she keep asking me that?

1092
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,761
Suyeon's feistier than she looks.

1093
00:56:47,456 --> 00:56:49,608
I wonder if Jungi is really okay.

1094
00:56:57,737 --> 00:56:58,767
Oh, gosh.

1095
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,189
What are you doing? You scared me.

1096
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:03,122
Sorry.

1097
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:08,174
Are those tears in your eyes?

1098
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,091
What?

1099
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,200
No, it's because I yawned.

1100
00:57:12,284 --> 00:57:13,447
Really?

1101
00:57:13,827 --> 00:57:15,788
Shouldn't you eat something?

1102
00:57:15,922 --> 00:57:17,536
Do you want me to get you some porridge?

1103
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,957
No, thanks.

1104
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,106
I don't have an appetite right now.

1105
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:28,102
What? He doesn't seem okay at all.

1106
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:33,059
Hello, everyone.

1107
00:57:33,144 --> 00:57:34,832
I'm Han Suyeon of Report Special Force.

1108
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:37,221
I'm here today at Yanggu,
Gangwon-do to meet a cow...

1109
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,039
...that can write letters using its tail.

1110
00:57:39,124 --> 00:57:40,675
Let's go meet the cow that's known as...

1111
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,741
...the Han Seokbong of livestock.

1112
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:44,339
Let's go meet...

1113
00:57:46,274 --> 00:57:47,733
What's that smell?

1114
00:57:49,918 --> 00:57:52,538
Right. I left a stew on the stove!

1115
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,977
Oh, no!

1116
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:04,335
That's hot. It's all burnt.

1117
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,304
There's so much smoke.

1118
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:08,902
What should I do?

1119
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:10,383
Darn it, this is driving me crazy.

1120
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,497
Minah, why did you suddenly come out?

1121
00:58:19,326 --> 00:58:21,198
Why is there so much smoke?

1122
00:58:21,283 --> 00:58:22,134
I know.

1123
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:24,070
Minah.

1124
00:58:24,723 --> 00:58:26,024
- Yes?
- What's wrong?

1125
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:26,972
Well...

1126
00:58:27,432 --> 00:58:29,301
...Suyeon slapped me again.

1127
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:30,351
What?

1128
00:58:30,622 --> 00:58:32,642
Suyeon slapped you again?

1129
00:58:33,633 --> 00:58:35,114
Suyeon, what is she talking about?

1130
00:58:35,423 --> 00:58:36,510
No, the thing is...

1131
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,788
...I was waving my hands
to clear the smoke...

1132
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:41,996
...and Minah suddenly
popped out of nowhere.

1133
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,657
So you just happened to slap
her again by accident?

1134
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:47,502
Yes.

1135
00:58:49,038 --> 00:58:52,085
I'm sorry, Minah.
It was really an accident.

1136
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,102
It's true, Jeongeun.

1137
00:58:57,804 --> 00:58:59,870
I'm telling the truth, Wooshik. Really.

1138
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,244
It was really an accident.

1139
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,841
My butt... Ouch, my butt.

1140
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,764
The performance is just around the corner.

1141
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:16,990
I should keep practicing my dancing.

1142
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:20,421
I'll endure the pain...

1143
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:22,098
...and try practicing.

1144
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,016
♪ Nakyang, Dongcheon, Ehwa...

1145
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:30,006
What? What's wrong with this?

1146
00:59:30,297 --> 00:59:32,830
Darn it. How did this thing get stuck?

1147
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:45,984
How did it get stuck?

1148
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,134
Why didn't anyone remove that nail?

1149
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:50,947
Jungi, I brought some porridge...

1150
00:59:56,628 --> 00:59:57,596
"Porridge"

1151
00:59:58,924 --> 01:00:00,766
Jungi, no!

1152
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,964
Gosh, my butt.

1153
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,398
Jungi, I'm sorry.

1154
01:00:17,634 --> 01:00:20,404
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Of course it does!

1155
01:00:20,522 --> 01:00:22,378
My butt hit the edge of that chair!

1156
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:24,201
This is all your fault!

1157
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,101
- My butt.
- I was just worried about you.

1158
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:30,842
I really thought you were going to die.

1159
01:00:30,926 --> 01:00:32,294
Why would I die?

1160
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,150
Wait, what's wrong with you?

1161
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:35,217
Are you crying?

1162
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:36,978
Don't cry.

1163
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:38,536
You look even uglier when you cry.

1164
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,862
Shut it.

1165
01:00:41,606 --> 01:00:42,439
Hey.

1166
01:00:43,103 --> 01:00:44,704
Were you that worried about me?

1167
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:46,538
Yes I was, you jerk.

1168
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:51,267
It's good to have someone
who worries about me.

1169
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:53,388
Jeongeun.

1170
01:00:54,293 --> 01:00:55,370
If...

1171
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:59,110
...I get an artificial sphincter...

1172
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:03,396
...you really have to take care of me
for the rest of my life, okay?

1173
01:01:03,481 --> 01:01:04,314
What?

1174
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:05,900
Forget it!

1175
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,134
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1176
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:16,905
It wasn't on purpose.

1177
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:18,964
This is not fair.

1178
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:21,613
Why would I hit Minah on purpose?

1179
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,267
Does it mean I'm jealous
because I like Wooshik?

1180
01:01:28,158 --> 01:01:29,188
That's ridiculous.

1181
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,154
You have to hold in your
emotions as much as possible...

1182
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,643
...and let it out in this part.

1183
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:37,997
That will make it sound much better. Okay?

1184
01:01:38,082 --> 01:01:41,633
I know that. But it's not
as easy as it seems.

1185
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,344
- By the way, Mr. Cha.
- What?

1186
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:47,535
Do you know you look so handsome
when you're working?

1187
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,075
What? Where did that come from?

1188
01:01:50,171 --> 01:01:52,012
I'm always handsome.

1189
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:54,383
You're so stuck-up as ever.

1190
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:57,116
What? It was a joke.

1191
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,350
Suyeon, what are you doing?

1192
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,887
Can't you see? I'm cleaning.

1193
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:22,986
I already cleaned here earlier.

1194
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,948
What are you talking about?
There's so much dust.

1195
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:27,746
Wooshik, lift your legs.

1196
01:02:27,986 --> 01:02:28,819
Okay.

1197
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,153
Minah, can you lift your legs too?

1198
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,221
Is this a house or a dust ball?

1199
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:43,929
I just can't stand this.

1200
01:03:30,095 --> 01:03:33,066
Why do I feel concerned
when I see Wooshik with Minah?

1201
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:35,108
Could it be that I like Wooshik?

1202
01:03:35,193 --> 01:03:36,170
Why are you still awake?

1203
01:03:36,255 --> 01:03:37,755
I'm writing a proposal for a new feature.

1204
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,673
- How did it go?

1205
01:03:38,758 --> 01:03:40,664
- They like it!
- Really?

1206
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:41,951
Jungi's play is tomorrow?

1207
01:03:42,036 --> 01:03:44,641
I'm going with all my friends.
You'd better do a good job.

1208
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:45,895
Were you with him the whole time?

1209
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,611
He said he wants to get serious.

1210
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:50,910
Then bring him here. I'll check
if he's good for you or not.

1211
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,862
Why do you care about that guy?

1212
01:03:52,947 --> 01:03:55,562
Are you jealous because
Jeongeun is seeing another guy?

1213
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,571
I have a presentation
on the new feature today.

1214
01:03:57,656 --> 01:04:00,326
- But I dozed off and I'm late.
- I'll give you a ride.

1215
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:02,553
But you look so pale.

1216
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,376
Good luck. Go Suyeon!

1217
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:07,290
Why do I feel so dizzy...?

1218
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,016
