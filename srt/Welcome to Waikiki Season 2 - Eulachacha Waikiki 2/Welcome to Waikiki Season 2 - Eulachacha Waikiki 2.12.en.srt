1
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,975
Jeongeun, I'm almost done.
Call the others.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,777
-Use our new signal.
-Yes.

3
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:20,053
It's lunch time.

4
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,456
It is! What is today's side dishes?

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,698
Stir-fried spicy pork.
It's stir-fried spicy pork!

6
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:42,075
As expected!
It really is stir-fried spicy pork!

7
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,878
It's really more comfortable with
the alphorn. Right?

8
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,382
That's right. Jeongpal,
you're finally of good use this time.

9
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,284
What? Do you want to die? Do you?

10
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,085
You're hitting me again!

11
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,087
You said you'd live nicely from now on?

12
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,501
You brought this upon yourself,
so just accept it.

13
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:57,591
I brought it upon myself?

14
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,883
You don't have to know! Just eat!

15
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,574
All of you know that today's
the cleaning day, right?

16
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:05,580
But I have a gathering with my
university's club alumni.

17
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,569
It's the super strength club of
Huam University. Let's go! Go! Go!

18
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,085
Really? You're not making it up because
you don't want to clean the house?

19
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:12,272
It's the truth.

20
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,275
It's our first gathering after
graduation, so I need to attend.

21
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,245
They must have changed a lot.

22
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,952
What's this?
Why did you come back together?

23
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,569
We met on the way.

24
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,055
Really?

25
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,157
You guys haven't eaten, right? Sit down.

26
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:33,160
I've eaten hotteok on the way with
Suyeon, so I'm not that hungry.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,728
But isn't it the time for your show?

28
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,129
-Yes.
-I'll watch it together.

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,531
Change your clothes and come out.

30
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,732
Okay, sure.

31
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,123
Enjoy your meal then.

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,540
What's going on?

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,651
Was Wooshik really heartbroken?

34
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,751
He's such a cool guy.

35
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,145
American style.

36
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:55,082
Good then. Let's just eat.

37
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,555
I'm sure this is the place.

38
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,173
Jungi, here! Over here!

39
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,175
Wait a minute.

40
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,177
You...

41
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,180
You're Dongcheol? Dongcheol!

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,582
Yes, it's me.

43
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,783
But why are you so late?

44
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,393
The traffic was bad.

45
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:33,887
But where are the others?

46
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,197
They all said they'll be late.

47
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:39,092
Goodness, tardiness doesn't
change from then until now.

48
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,494
Hey, have some chicken.

49
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,296
Hey Lee Jungi, how long has it been?

50
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,998
It's been so long!

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,902
You're Byungsoo, right?

52
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,203
No, I'm not.

53
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,389
-Who are you then?
-You don't know me?

54
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:55,108
We secretly ate ramyeon at the club's
room and set the place on fire,

55
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,222
and we burnt all of our eyebrows.

56
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:00,013
Yes, the eyebrow! I remember you now.

57
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,716
But what was your name again? What was it?

58
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,718
What the heck? You don't remember my name?

59
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,520
How can you do this to me?

60
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,821
So disappointing. I'm disappointed.

61
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,324
No, no. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

62
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,229
Wait, what was his name again?

63
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:24,905
I remember his face,
but why can't I recall his name?

64
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,308
I feel so sorry to him.

65
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,911
It's so uncomfortable.

66
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,713
I should go now then.

67
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,216
You're Jungi, right?

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,211
Who is this?

69
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,424
But I don't remember his face at all.

70
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,822
Don't you remember me?

71
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,191
You brat, it's me!

72
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,794
I don't know. I don't know, you brat!

73
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,798
Darn it, he'd be sad
if I say I don't know him.

74
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,902
I know. Of course I do!

75
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,504
I remember you so well.

76
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,806
How long has it been. How are you?

77
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,708
I'm doing fine of course.

78
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,077
I'm doing fine as well.

79
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,180
But you've changed so much!

80
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,682
You've become a lot handsome.

81
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,050
Really?

82
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,453
You became handsome too.

83
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,550
Let's get back and have some drink.

84
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,146
But I have something urgent,
so I need to go.

85
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,060
Really?

86
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,663
Then let's have a drink next time.
You know my number, right?

87
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,067
Yes, I know. Of course I know.

88
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,368
Okay, good then.

89
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,470
I know your number too,
so I'll contact you soon.

90
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,371
Okay.

91
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,173
I'll leave first then.

92
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:33,874
Okay.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,075
My friend.

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,282
Darn it. Who the hell are you?

95
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,888
Just what is your name?

96
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,860
Did you have fun meeting
your friends yesterday?

97
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,061
What fun?

98
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:58,565
I met them but I can't recall their name.
I felt so sorry.

99
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,466
What?

100
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,782
It hasn't been long since you graduated,
how can you not know their name?

101
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,272
That's why you should cut
back on your drinking.

102
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,841
That's alcohol infringement.

103
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,443
My goodness!

104
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,367
It's not infringement,
it's alcoholic dementia.

105
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:16,049
-I'll be careful.
-You're the wrong one!

106
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:18,151
For goodness sake.

107
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,327
Hello?

108
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,038
Oh hey, what's up?

109
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,425
Okay. I'll see you later.

110
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,428
-I'm going out now.
-Where are you going?

111
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,064
A friend of mine wants
to talk about a vacancy.

112
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:32,132
I'll be back.

113
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,334
-Be careful.
-Okay.

114
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:39,639
Kibong should get a job soon. I'm worried.

115
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,874
Exactly.

116
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,643
Brother.

117
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,745
What's that in your hand?

118
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,648
It's coffee. I'll be working on
song composing from today onwards.

119
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,876
So coffee is really important.

120
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,151
Song composing?

121
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:54,354
I think I've been neglecting
my work all these time.

122
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,557
I should start writing a
good song for my comeback.

123
00:05:57,686 --> 00:05:58,980
Good thinking.

124
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,662
But you know that I'll be sensitive
once I start composing, right?

125
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:04,764
Do your best and avoid
coming into my studio.

126
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,666
I hope you guys can be more quiet.

127
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,968
Especially you.

128
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,087
Okay.

129
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,107
-I'm going up.
-Okay.

130
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,509
All the best!

131
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,703
I guess he's trying to
pull himself together now.

132
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,015
Exactly. I thought he'd
be having a hard time.

133
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,817
It's a relief then.

134
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,798
That's right. Let's forget Suyeon,

135
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,401
and make a masterpiece!

136
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,572
(The Leader of Global Marketing, Yutnori)

137
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,208
Global network marketing, Yutnori?

138
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,510
Your company's name is quite unique.

139
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,217
You said you have work-related to discuss.
What is it?

140
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,098
Well...

141
00:06:55,382 --> 00:07:00,687
Kibong, do you know how many losses we
experience a day because of retail margin?

142
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,393
-But what is retail margin?
-What?

143
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,293
-You don't know what's retail margin?
-No, I don't.

144
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,094
It's my first time listening to it.

145
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:09,596
I see.

146
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:10,830
Really?

147
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,099
Of course. That's plausible.

148
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,200
I was like that too.

149
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,201
So, what it means is,

150
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,004
let's say the factory make
a product worth 100 won.

151
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,206
Before this product reaches you,

152
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,011
it goes through the
wholesaler, the retailer,

153
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:26,279
and with advertising fees
added, the price gets higher.

154
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:31,200
So, you'll end up buying this 100
won product in 300 won to 500 won.

155
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,787
The fees that are added in the
process are what we called as...

156
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,689
...retail margin.

157
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:41,561
But what if you could reduce the retail
margin to buy the product cheaper?

158
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,763
-It would be good then.
-Right?

159
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,366
Our company does that.

160
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,972
Other people say that what we do
is illegal pyramid or whatever...

161
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,792
But that's because they're
ignorant and stupid.

162
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,411
You're doing a good work.

163
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,921
So, do you want to work with us?

164
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:01,614
What?

165
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,417
Are you going to hire me?

166
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,388
But what job is this?

167
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:13,301
Global Network Marketing Yutnori
runs on a membership system.

168
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:19,366
There are five membership level, and they
are "Do", "Ge", "Geol", "Yut", and "Mo".

169
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,967
"Do", "Ge", "Geol", "Yut", "Mo"?

170
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,636
So, that's why you're called Yutnori.

171
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,638
That's right. Okay, look at this.

172
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,640
As you can see, I'm on "Yut" level.

173
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,843
And Namgyu is on "Geol" level.

174
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:31,544
I see.

175
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,547
But how much is the salary?

176
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,649
We don't have salary.

177
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,351
-What?
-But we have incentive.

178
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,153
-Incentive?
-For example,

179
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,456
Mr. Kibong, you introduced
our product to another person,

180
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,258
and if that person purchases our product,

181
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,361
then the company will
be giving you incentive.

182
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,264
I only introduced a product
but you're going to pay me?

183
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,956
-Why?
-Because you helped us in selling them,

184
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,462
so it's a sign of gratitude from us.

185
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,772
You give money out of gratitude?

186
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,874
-Why so?
-What?

187
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:07,280
Because in the company's point of
view, we made a profit because of you.

188
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,484
But it doesn't end here.

189
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,389
If that person introduced our
product to another person...

190
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,260
...part of the profit will go to you.

191
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,161
What?

192
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,763
But I don't know that other person.

193
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,865
I didn't do anything...

194
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:27,667
...but I'll get paid for it?

195
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:29,469
-Why?
-What?

196
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,780
However it is,

197
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:37,277
it is true that we're
getting profit thanks to you.

198
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,291
But still, getting profit
without doing anything...

199
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,573
-...is not right.
-What?

200
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,553
I'm not someone who doesn't
know what's right from wrong.

201
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,756
I can't work like this.

202
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:55,662
Goodness, until when do I need
to go around with my profile?

203
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:59,232
Gosh! Look where you're going!

204
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,167
-I apologize.
-Wait!

205
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,634
Hey Jungi!

206
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,337
Who is this?

207
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,739
That guy yesterday from the washroom.

208
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,228
-What are you doing here?
-What?

209
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,545
I came to give my profile
to the production.

210
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,413
Profile?

211
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,748
Wait, you're an actor?

212
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,551
They're still minor roles but...

213
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,653
You should have told me sooner.

214
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,956
I work at Garmavel Pictures.

215
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,559
-Really?
-Yes!

216
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:27,060
If I knew you were an actor, I would
have helped you with a lot of things.

217
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,448
Jungi, why don't we go and have a drink
somewhere. We can talk about work too.

218
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,663
Sure. Let's go, my friend.

219
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,440
The movie that we're working on at the
moment is from Director Park Chanwook.

220
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,542
-Director Park?
-Yes.

221
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,743
I was on my way back from meeting him.

222
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,246
-Do you want to meet him?
-What?

223
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,048
Of course.

224
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,050
I'd be so thankful if that happens.

225
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,435
Okay, good.

226
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,604
I'll try and set you up then.

227
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,423
First, let's drink up.

228
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,491
Sure, my friend.

229
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,627
Cheers.

230
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,732
I can't keep on calling him "friend".

231
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,634
This is driving me crazy.

232
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,637
I should find out his name
and contact number quickly.

233
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,047
Only then I can get his help.

234
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,244
By the way...

235
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,913
Can you give me a namecard?

236
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,248
Namecard? Let me see.

237
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,150
Where's my namecard?

238
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,252
I'm all out of it.

239
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,656
Why do we need namecard between us anyway?

240
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:32,759
Yes. That's right. Why would we need one?

241
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,762
I don't know. I really don't.

242
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,631
I don't know your name.

243
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,934
Should I just ask him for his name?

244
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,835
No, I can't.

245
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,638
It's over for me if he's offended by it.

246
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,540
What should I do?

247
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,541
Hello?

248
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,044
Yes, I'm calling about the
reservation I made just now.

249
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,546
Your food is here.

250
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,248
Yes, for 3 PM.

251
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,816
My name?

252
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,218
My name is...

253
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,619
Park...

254
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:01,721
Darn it!

255
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,624
Darn it! I couldn't hear it!

256
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,627
Why do you have to sneeze right now?

257
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,329
No, that's not it.

258
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,330
Park...

259
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,764
Darn it!

260
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,452
-I'm sorry, I'll bring you a new one.
-Yes, thank you.

261
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,304
Darn it!

262
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:19,982
Jungi, what are you doing?

263
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:21,708
What? Oh, yes.

264
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,479
I was checking if she got hurt anywhere.

265
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,498
Are you fine?

266
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,615
Yes, I'm fine.

267
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,117
My goodness!

268
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,519
It was my chance to find out his name.

269
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,589
No, wait.
At least I found out his last name.

270
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,291
It's Park. Mr. Park!

271
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,289
-My dear friend,
-Yes?

272
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,279
I'll go to the washroom for a bit.

273
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,707
Hello. Jaewon?

274
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,201
It's me, Jungi.

275
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,705
Do you remember if we have anyone
who works at Garmavel Pictures?

276
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,108
You're not sure either?

277
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,581
Then, can you send me a list of our
club members with the last name "Park"?

278
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,772
♪ After breakfast, ddang.
♪ After lunch, ddang.

279
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,659
♪ It was raining when I opened the window.

280
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,861
♪ Three worms are crawling

281
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:16,362
♪ Oh my, so scared! It's a skull!

282
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,465
That's a good drawing! So good!

283
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,068
Amazing!

284
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,269
Hold on a minute.

285
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,271
What am I doing right now?

286
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,675
Is it because it's been a while since I
last wrote a song? I can't focus at all.

287
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,778
Okay, let's focus! Focus!

288
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:41,888
What an eyesore.

289
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:50,096
Okay, it's all clean and neat now.

290
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:52,298
Now, I can finally focus.

291
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:57,904
My gosh, why is it so messy here too?

292
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,607
Okay, done!

293
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,625
Now, I can finally start composing.

294
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,028
Should we start then?

295
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,030
Let's see.

296
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,135
What's this?

297
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,413
Okay, then. It's perfect now!

298
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,116
Let's begin then.

299
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,786
Let's see.

300
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,591
Why is the ink so lumpy?

301
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,761
I used to have a much better pen.

302
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,449
What brand was it?

303
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,935
"A less lumpy pen..."

304
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:07,673
No, but this is not about money!

305
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,475
Why wouldn't it be?

306
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,379
It's not right that I receive the
profit without doing anything!

307
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,681
I, a real man Kook Kibong...

308
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,284
...doesn't live my life like that!

309
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,354
-My goodness!
-Are you okay?

310
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:30,963
Hello, nice to meet you.

311
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:35,067
I am the head of all levels, "Mo".
My name is Kim Cheolmin.

312
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,369
Hello.

313
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,640
From what I heard, you think it's not
right that you're receiving profit...

314
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,143
-...even though you didn't do anything?
-Yes.

315
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,145
No matter how tough the world gets,

316
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,641
-people shouldn't do that.
-I see.

317
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:50,958
You could think of it that way. Yes.

318
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,752
I heard that you used to play baseball?

319
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,954
Then, why don't you look at it this way?

320
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:57,924
By chance, at full base and no one's out,
and you're at bat.

321
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:00,139
But you hit an outfield fly and got out.

322
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:02,241
But you tag up the third base
runner and score a point.

323
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:05,241
That means, even though you're
out, you scored your team a point.

324
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:05,932
That's right.

325
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,067
Then, do you think that
is unreasonable as well?

326
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,937
What? No. That's a fair play.

327
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,638
Right. Bingo!

328
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,841
It's the same concept.

329
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,543
It's not true that you didn't do anything.

330
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,547
It's the effort and care when you
introduced our product to a new customer.

331
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,683
That is why you received the profit.

332
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:25,781
I see. So that's it.

333
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,753
You should have said
so from the beginning.

334
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,056
No wonder you're at "Mo" level.

335
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,058
It's nothing.

336
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:35,261
So, what do you think?
Do you want to work with us?

337
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,163
Yes. I'd like to try.

338
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,569
Bravo!

339
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,169
By the way,

340
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,881
you'll begin at "Do"
level when you sign up.

341
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,587
To become a Mo-level member like
me, it takes quite a while.

342
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,212
But there's a way to start
right at the "Geol" level.

343
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,981
And what's that?

344
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,282
A pre-payment.

345
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,383
Pre-payment?

346
00:16:57,498 --> 00:17:00,362
If you make a pre-payment
of 5 million won,

347
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:03,956
you'll be able to start at "Geol" level.

348
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,258
What?

349
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:08,160
But starting at "Geol" by using money,

350
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:09,762
isn't that considered cheating?

351
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,241
It's like paying to get a promotion.

352
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,668
That's cheating!

353
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:20,443
If you're a new employee,
you should walk your way to the top.

354
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:23,943
I'm not someone who cheats my way out.

355
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,178
If it's like this, I can't work here.

356
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,279
By the way,

357
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,485
my company will be working on
more than 10 films next year.

358
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:35,388
I'll let you do audition for all of
them, so don't worry.

359
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,989
Really?

360
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,493
Thank you, my friend.

361
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,097
I should hurry find out his name.

362
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:48,289
The message came!

363
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,807
Why are there so many Mr. Park?

364
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,410
How do I check this?

365
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,418

368
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,257
It's no one.

369
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,359
I'm just going through my contacts.

370
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,163
Okay. He's not Mingoo.

371
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,066

378
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,223
What are you doing since just now?

379
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,725
And who's Jaecheol?

380
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,529
It's just a name that came across my mind.

381
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,833
What's going on?

382
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,216
I've tried every name on the list.

383
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,405
What's going on right now?

384
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,874
Was his name not in the list?

385
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,810
This is driving me crazy.

386
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,279
Just what is your name?

387
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:14,353
What the heck is your name?

388
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,155
-Why are you staring at me?
-What?

389
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:19,659
I'm just glad to meet you after so long.

390
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,727
So silly.

391
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,565
Yes, mom. I met Jungi after so
long, so we're having a drink.

392
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,363
What the? So his mom knows me too?

393
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,970
-You want him to come over?
-That means we're really close.

394
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,372
-Alright, mom.
-But why can't I remember?

395
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,375
Jungi, my mom wants you to come over.

396
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,477
She'll prepare food and drinks for us.
Let's go.

397
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,680
But going to your house is quite...

398
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:45,284
My mom is going to prepare food and
drinks for us, how can you act like this?

399
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,565
My mom adores you so much.

400
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,256
I'm so disappointed in you. I really am.

401
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,757
Okay, fine.

402
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,793
Fine, let's go. Let's go to your home.

403
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:54,881
Really?

404
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:56,996
Of course we should.

405
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,364
Let's go, Jungi.

406
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:00,515
Sure. Let's go, my friend.

407
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,606
If I don't go, it'll hurt his feelings.

408
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,712
No, wait. I might remember after
looking at his mother's face.

409
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,781
Come in. Get inside.

410
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,584
Mom, I'm back. Mom!

411
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,221
-Are you back?
-Yes.

412
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,908
Oh my! He's Jungi?

413
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,928
Yes. Hello, nice to meet you.

414
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,331
I don't know.
I can't remember his mom either.

415
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,034
I can't remember at all.

416
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,237
My goodness, how long has it been?

417
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,940
But you've changed a lot!

418
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:43,722
Really?

419
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,991
Anyway, it's really nice
to meet you after so long.

420
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:48,380
Back then, you even ate at our house,

421
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:50,869
and even slept at our house.
You remember, right?

422
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:51,584
What?

423
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,287
Of course. That's for sure.

424
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,591
I even slept over?

425
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:01,672
Your little brother would have
loved to see Jungi again too.

426
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:03,195
Yes, exactly!

427
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,297
Even his younger brother knows me?

428
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,401
Just how close were we?

429
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:11,964
I really should quit drinking.

430
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:15,274
Sit down first.
I'll bring in some food and drinks.

431
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,464
-Thank you.
-Sure.

432
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,592
This is driving me nuts!

433
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,386
Wow, that's amazing!

434
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,256
A pen can be spinned around like this.

435
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,559
Why am I watching this?

436
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,363
How did I end up here from
"pen with no clumpy ink"?

437
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,766
Cha Wooshik, what is wrong with you?

438
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,168
Aren't you going to compose?

439
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:46,085
Pull yourself together and focus!

440
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,181
Wooshik, let's eat chicken.

441
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:56,682
Forget it, I'm not eating.

442
00:21:58,785 --> 00:21:59,885
Darn it!

443
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,602
I forgot what to write!

444
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,492
Hey!

445
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,096
Didn't I tell you not to come in
my studio because I need to focus?

446
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,226
I just came out with an amazing melody,

447
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:15,232
and because of you, I forgot it!
All because of you!

448
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:19,672
-I'm sorry. But still, have some chicken.
-I told you I don't want it!

449
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,688
Get out! Get out now!

450
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:24,276
Goodness!

451
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,478
They're no help in my life at all.

452
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,952
Gosh, my back.

453
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,755
Is it because I've been
sitting down for too long?

454
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:38,757
I should do it lying down then.

455
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:49,368
I'm telling you, it's not cheating.

456
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,171
How is paying for a promotion
not considered cheating?

457
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,773
Because of the thought that
everyone is possible with money,

458
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,055
our society is a mess right now.

459
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:00,145
Real man Kook Kibong...

460
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:03,048
...doesn't cheat my way through life.

461
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:07,152
My gosh, my blood pressure is rising!

462
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,457
Nice to meet you.

463
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,958
Ta-da!

464
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,060
Three "Mo", no less.

465
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,442
I'm a Three-Mo-level member, Kang Namgil.

466
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,231
Nice to meet you.

467
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,922
I heard that you've been arguing
that making a pre-payment...

468
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:26,191
...to start on the Geol level is cheating.

469
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:29,708
Yes. It's the same with
paying for a promotion.

470
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,510
So, that is cheating.

471
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,281
It's understandable that you think
that way because you're new to this.

472
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:38,796
Kook Kibong,
what if you think of it this way?

473
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,488
-How?
-There's a pitcher that debuted with you.

474
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:46,992
But in order to save up money, the
pitcher uses cheap, low-quality equipment.

475
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,994
On the other hand,
you invest on the equipment,

476
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,196
even get private lesson,
and your skills improved.

477
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:56,014
And in the end, you became the
starting pitcher for your team.

478
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:57,591
Is that cheating too?

479
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,712
No, that's not cheating.

480
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:01,038
That's how much I've invested in.

481
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:03,343
That's right. Absolutely right.

482
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:08,547
The same goes for pre-payment. The
blood and tears of gathering that money.

483
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,517
So, our company appreciates your effort.

484
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,831
How can that be cheating?
Don't you think so?

485
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,522
I see.

486
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,524
You should have said that much sooner.

487
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,129
Maybe because you're "three-Mo" level,

488
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,628
I could understand it right away.

489
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,432
Alright. Then, should we start
with the pre-payment then?

490
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:27,848
It is just 5 million won.

491
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,435
I don't have 5 million won though.

492
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:32,438
When I checked yesterday,
my account only have like 5,200 won.

493
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,742
Then, you can just borrow from a friend.

494
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:39,121
-Or from your parents?
-At my age,

495
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,034
how can I ask money from my parents?

496
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,932
That's not the right thing
to do to our parents.

497
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,462
Then, what about borrowing from friends?

498
00:24:46,546 --> 00:24:48,162
I don't borrow money from friends.

499
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:50,837
That's not the right
thing to do to friends.

500
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,271
We also have good loan...

501
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,178
My mom told me to never get a loan.

502
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:58,268
Disobeying your parents is not right.

503
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,166
Then, do yo want to borrow from me...

504
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:04,470
Gosh, borrowing from
someone you just met...

505
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:07,751
...is not the right thing to
do to someone you just met.

506
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,590
I will just begin from "Do" level then.

507
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,678
Slowly and earnestly.

508
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,659
By the way, do you provide meals?

509
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:17,950
I'm hungry.

510
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,551
My goodness!

511
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,916
My gosh!

512
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,472
Hey, do they give meals here?

513
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:29,061
"Right thing to do" my foot!

514
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:32,664
What's wrong with you?
You said you'll get me a job?

515
00:25:32,756 --> 00:25:34,967
Just forget it. Leave! Now!

516
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,870
I don't want to! I need to get a job!

517
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:40,472
On top of that, there's no bus
anymore, so I can't go.

518
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,075
Hey, just take this.

519
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:44,977
I'll pay for the taxi, so hurry and leave.

520
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:46,879
Here you go. Do the right thing and leave.

521
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,580
Namgyu, wait! Namgyu!

522
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,650
Hey! Namgyu! Open up!

523
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,085
Hey! Open up!

524
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:55,554
I will work really hard.

525
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,557
I'll work hard from Do
until I get to the top!

526
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,060
Namgyu! Please open the door!

527
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,094
Namgyu!

528
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:09,104
Remember when, you, me and my brother
went to the amusement park together?

529
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:14,973
While taking the rides, my brother
puked on your clothes. Do you remember?

530
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:15,774
What?

531
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,379
Yes! Of course I remember.

532
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,382
I can't remember.

533
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,384
I can't remember at all!

534
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,577
How can this happen?

535
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,088
Mom, what's that?

536
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,887
I heard that Jungi became an actor?

537
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,501
I want to get his signature
before he gets popular.

538
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:34,501
Sure.

539
00:26:34,585 --> 00:26:37,196
Jungi, you can give me an
autograph, right?

540
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:37,790
What?

541
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,100
Yes, of course! My autograph.

542
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:52,798
"To: Aunty"

543
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:54,505
Write down my name besides it too.

544
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,982
What? Your name as well?

545
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,501
Yes. Why?

546
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,120
No, it's nothing.

547
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,624
This is driving me crazy!

548
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,126
What do I do?

549
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,530
Marathon Winner Park Jongoh?

550
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,232
Wait a minute.

551
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,034
It's impossible that his
father was the one who won.

552
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:18,170
Then, is that his name?

553
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,374
Wait, what's that?

554
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,774
Marathon Runner Up Park Jongwoo?

555
00:27:25,763 --> 00:27:26,845
That's right.

556
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,248
He has a brother.

557
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,384
Then, it's between Park
Jongoh or Park Jongwoo.

558
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,987
One of it is his name.

559
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,688
Why are you hesitating?

560
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,392
Wait, do you not know my name?

561
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,694
No, that's impossible.

562
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,660
How can I not know your name?

563
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,865
Hey, Jongwooh!

564
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,468
So ridiculous.

565
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,576
"Park Jong..."

566
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,346
Is it Woo? Or Oh?

567
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,249
It's only between this two.

568
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,752
Let's just guess it.

569
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,754
Let's leave it to luck!

570
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:10,956
Here we go!

571
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:11,557
"Park Jongwoo"

572
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,259
What are you looking at?

573
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:16,061
Hurry and sign it after writing my name.

574
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,964
I guessed it right! It really is Jongwoo!

575
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,234
So, your name is Jongwoo! Jongwoo!

576
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,936
Nice to meet you Jongwoo!

577
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:28,006
But wait a minute.
Do I have a friend called Jongwoo?

578
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,641
Whatever. I don't care!

579
00:28:29,923 --> 00:28:31,410
Sure Jongwoo.

580
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,507
Jongwoo, I'll sign it.

581
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:43,121
Lee...

582
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,506
Lee Jungi?

583
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,754
-Jun...
-He's not Kang Jungi?

584
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,295
-It's Gi.
-No, it can't be.

585
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,197
I'm sure he's Kang Jungi.

586
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,468
Jongwoo, what do you think?
My autograph is really cool, right?

587
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,870
But Jungi, do you perhaps...

588
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:00,639
...use a stage name or change your name?

589
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,441
Why would I use such a thing?

590
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,849
My parents gave me such a precious name.

591
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:05,544
Really?

592
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,967
What was our school's name?

593
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,267
Maybe because we had some drink,
I suddenly forgot what it's called.

594
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,853
What? No matter how drunk you are,

595
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,788
-how can you forget your school's name?
-Exactly.

596
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,258
It's Huam University. Huam University.

597
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,077
No, it's not.
I'm from Myeongseong University.

598
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,563
What's this? Who is he then?

599
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,765
What's going on right now?

600
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,535
Hey Jongwoo, over here.

601
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,938
You brat, why are you so late?

602
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,239
Sorry everyone.

603
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,541
I saw Jungi just now.

604
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,236
Jungi came? Where?

605
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,945
He said he had an urgent
business and left.

606
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,640
He lost so much weight.

607
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:43,649
He lost weight? Jungi?

608
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,819
That's weird.
He still looked the same last month.

609
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,621
Wait a minute.

610
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,025
Where is his picture?

611
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,542
-Take a look.
-What?

612
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,752
You're right. He probably went on a diet.

613
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,946
Do you think so?

614
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,031
What the heck?

615
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,832
Then, this man...

616
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,823
...is a stranger.

617
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,703
A total stranger.

618
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,004
What are you looking at?

619
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,407
-My dear friend, Jongwoo.
-What?

620
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,009
Jongwoo, let's meet each other often.

621
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,912
And help me with my work too, okay?

622
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,015
Jongwoo, Jongwoo, my dear Jongwoo!

623
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:18,596
Sure, let's do that.

624
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,721
Darn it. I can't even ask who he is now.
What should I do?

625
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:27,326
Hey, it's pretty late.
Don't you have to go home?

626
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:30,362
Go where? He should spend the night here.

627
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,331
Jungi, do you understand?

628
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,932
Yes, aunty.

629
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,969
I'll be sleeping with
Jongwoo in such a long time.

630
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,938
I love it.

631
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:45,444
Hey, Jongwoo.

632
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,245
Do you remember that time?

633
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:52,351
You know, when our club performed
at a women's university.

634
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:56,521
We hit our heads with solid wooden
sticks and the blood kept coming out.

635
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,824
The girls all fainted and stuff.

636
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,058
I don't know.

637
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,627
I don't even know where is Huam-dong.

638
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,930
How could I know about
your super strength club?

639
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,933
Who the heck are you?

640
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,739
It was so fun back then.

641
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,840
Isn't that right, Jongwoo?

642
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:16,541
Of course.

643
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:22,547
Jongwoo, let's stay together
for the rest of our lives.

644
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,649
Jongwoo!

645
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,331
Jongwoo! Jongwoo! Park Jongwoo!

646
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:37,427
What the heck? What's going on?

647
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,730
What sound is that?

648
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,635
I fell asleep.

649
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,088
What time is it now?

650
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,474
What time... what?

651
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,809
4 AM.

652
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,779
Darn it. Just how long did I sleep for?

653
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,080
Darn it.

654
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,287
This is driving me nuts.

655
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:04,400
I didn't even draw a single note all day.

656
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,690
Stupid! Stupid!

657
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:08,293
Let's really focus now!

658
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,394
Focus!

659
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:16,334
What?

660
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,765
I'm all out of coffee.

661
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,473
I really can't work without coffee.

662
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,302
"At least for one minute"

663
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,883
"At least for one minute"

664
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,955
"Waikiki Guest House"

665
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,426
You look exhausted.

666
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,983
Why are you yawning so much?

667
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,999
I couldn't sleep after
shooting for all night.

668
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,901
What shoot was it about this time?

669
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:59,811
There's an octopus who does moonwalk
like Michael Jackson at Anmyeondo Island.

670
00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:02,207
What? An octopus that can moonwalk?

671
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:06,311
-Does it do for real?
-Yes, it did!

672
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,419
It used its suckers to walk backwards
like this, and it was fascinating.

673
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,499
But a drunk customer dipped it
in chojang and ate it by mistake,

674
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,588
so we had to stop shooting
and it was a total mess.

675
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:17,489
What?

676
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,492
Someone dipped an octopus that can
do moonwalk in chojang and eat it?

677
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:24,195
-How can such a thing happen.
-Exactly.

678
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:27,198
So, I stayed up all night
to shoot for a new item.

679
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,901
Being a reporter is harder than it looks.

680
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:36,690
You should have come sooner,
the soup is all cold now.

681
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:38,003
Hurry up and eat.

682
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,693
What about Wooshik?

683
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,020
He went out to record a song he wrote.

684
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,694
Really? I guess it's finally finished.

685
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:45,817
That's good.

686
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,287
Who are you calling so early?

687
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:53,190
It's Jongwoo.
He's my university's club friend.

688
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,384
He's suddenly avoiding my calls
and refuses to meet me at work.

689
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:58,663
Did I make any mistake?

690
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:01,066
He's probably busy. Hurry up and eat.

691
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:02,467
Goodness...

692
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,169
What's wrong with you?

693
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,872
A friend of mine introduced
me a really nice job.

694
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,691
I was kicked out before
I could even start.

695
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:14,779
I really wanted to work at
Global Network Marketing Yutnori.

696
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:16,982
You should have tried harder.

697
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,884
But Kibong,
you should eat even if it's by force.

698
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:21,386
Okay.

699
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,824
By the way, today's your food
truck first day of business, right?

700
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,325
Are all the preparations done?

701
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:28,625
Do you want my help?

702
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,330
It's okay.
I've prepared everything perfectly.

703
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,001
By the way, Kibong.

704
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,801
Actually there's something
you can help me with.

705
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,303
What is it?

706
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:55,053
This is so unbelievable.

707
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,056
Does it make sense that someone who wants
to open a food truck business can't drive?

708
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:00,191
It's just been a while since I drive.

709
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,428
Just help me out until I
get the hang of it, alright?

710
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:04,758
Fine.

711
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,631
Nice to meet you.

712
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,055
Hello.

713
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:09,934
-I guess you're new here.
-Yes.

714
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,737
I'm the owner of the steak
rice bowl food truck.

715
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,440
I'm the owner for the tacos food truck.
Nice to meet you.

716
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,740
-Nice to meet you.
-Yes.

717
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:18,043
I look forward to working with you.

718
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,544
We are more than honored to.

719
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,847
Yuri's Kitchen 31?

720
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,050
Do you sell ice cream?

721
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,544
No. It's a spaghetti shop.

722
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,055
There are 31 spaghetti
that you can choose from.

723
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,457
It's a fresh concept.

724
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,259
-I know, right?
-Yes.

725
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,464
By the way, it's my first
time in food truck business.

726
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,667
Do you have any know-how
for a business to do well?

727
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:47,172
We don't really have
any specific know-how.

728
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:48,973
It just needs to be delicious. That's all.

729
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,476
Any other cheap tricks won't work.

730
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,079
Only the taste.
You can only win with the taste!

731
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,983
Come and try the charcoal
steak rice bowl full of flavor.

732
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,890
The world-class tacos have arrived!

733
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,879
Let's get some sleep.

734
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,284
I've received a deposit.

735
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:36,287
"Minjoong Bank, Deposit: 1,213, 200 won"

736
00:37:36,398 --> 00:37:38,790
I guess this is my first salary.

737
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,559
What should I use it for?

738
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,063
First, I need to buy gifts for my family.

739
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,165
But what should I buy?

740
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,301
Let's ask them.

741
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,875
What is this mess in the room?

742
00:37:57,488 --> 00:38:00,645
He messed up his room,
trying to write a song.

743
00:38:00,758 --> 00:38:02,680
He should have cleaned it up.

744
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:08,286
Let me see what he wrote.

745
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:19,998
Let's see. "What's on your mind?
What am I..."

746
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,200
Just look at the lyrics.

747
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,836
They're so sad, you'll end up crying.

748
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,338
He pretended to be okay,
but they're all lies.

749
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,940
What do you mean? What's wrong with it?

750
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,141
Look at this.

751
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,734
They're all words for Suyeon.

752
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:35,213
I see. So that's what it is.

753
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,645
But Wooshik seems fine.

754
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,920
That's because he's pretending to
be fine to let Suyeon feel comfortable.

755
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,406
Does Wooshik like Suyeon that much?

756
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:46,001
Are you kidding?

757
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:50,395
Wooshik has liked Suyeon
from high school until now.

758
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:52,597
-Really?
-Do you think that's all?

759
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:55,086
Do you remember when he had
his head shaved at the protest?

760
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:57,994
He did it so that Suyeon
doesn't get fired.

761
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,872
And do you remember when he almost
got killed at the gangsters' event?

762
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,374
He did that to provide money
for Suyeon's tuition fee.

763
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:04,375
Really?

764
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,978
Wooshik is quite of a romantic guy.

765
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:10,181
I want to meet a man like Wooshik too.

766
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,015
What a joke!

767
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,015
Wake up! Stop dreaming!

768
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,314
Why would such men date you?

769
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:24,495
Who would ever go out with someone
as violent and monstrous...

770
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,066
...as you, King Kong?

771
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:28,967
What? Monstrous?

772
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,068
Do you want to die?

773
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,870
Come over here! Come here!

774
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,878
Save me! Save me! Tarzan, please save me!

775
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:37,175
King Kong is killing me!

776
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,679
Suyeon, what are you doing there?

777
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,551
Nothing at all.

778
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,343
I heard you went to record your song?
You're already back?

779
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:54,158
I left something.

780
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,261
Here you go.

781
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,062
What is this?

782
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,564
It's hotteok!

783
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:04,135
I bought it on the way.
You like it, right?

784
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:09,140
-Thank you.
-You don't have to. It's nothing.

785
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:10,842
What's going on?

786
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,277
What is that sound?

787
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,875
-Do you want to die?
-Let go! Let go of me!

788
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,475
Let me go!

789
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,765
I said let me go!

790
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,684
-What's going on?
-You brat!

791
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,053
What do you think you're doing right now?

792
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,355
He keeps on picking fight with me.

793
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,291
-You hit me first.
-Shut up!

794
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,725
Aren't you going to clean this up?

795
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:36,067
What is this?

796
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,970
It's broken!

797
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,673
It's an album that I treasure so much!

798
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,143
Wooshik, we apologize.

799
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,145
I will...

800
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,547
I'll buy a new one for you.

801
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,550
This is the first edition.
Do you know how hard it is to get that?

802
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,252
What are you going to do now?

803
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,888
What are you going to do?

804
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,659
Well, Wooshik...

805
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,760
Calm down first.

806
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:05,463
Relax. Relax.

807
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,365
Relax my foot!

808
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,368
Come here. Come over here!

809
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:12,770
Come here!

810
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,154
Wooshik has liked Suyeon
from high school until now.

811
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,861
Do you remember when he had
his head shaved at the protest?

812
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,031
He did it so that Suyeon
doesn't get fired.

813
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,834
I came over because I heard our
boss is going on a hunger strike.

814
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:44,936
But why are you doing it?

815
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:45,536
What?

816
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:48,118
The boss forces you to do it, right?

817
00:41:48,218 --> 00:41:49,507
Should I go and scold him?

818
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,309
No, don't. Don't do it.

819
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,313
He didn't force me to do it.
I'm doing it because I want to.

820
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,549
And do you remember when he almost
got killed at the gangsters' event?

821
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:01,441
He did that to provide money
for Suyeon's tuition fee.

822
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,955
That means, you don't have to
go to announcer academy anymore?

823
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:05,723
What does that mean?

824
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,325
Announcer academy?

825
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:09,427
No, it's nothing.

826
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,731
So, that was why.

827
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,235
That was why...

828
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,111
Now that I think of it,
I've only been receiving from Wooshik.

829
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,415
Is there anything that I can do for him?

830
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,919
Suyeon, where's Wooshik?

831
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,245
He left for recording.

832
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:37,221
Really?

833
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,557
That's a relief.

834
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,794
How long did we hide for?

835
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,596
How could he do this to his friends
for breaking that one album?

836
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:47,314
He has such a bad personality.

837
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,500
Wooshik said it's an album
that he treasures most.

838
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,302
Hold on a minute.

839
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,405
Whose album did you guys break?

840
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,607
It was probably Kim Gwangseok's Fourth album.

841
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:58,209
-Why?
-What?

842
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,011
No, it's nothing.

843
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:02,914
"Second-hand market"

844
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,349
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth Album"

845
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:10,738
I found it!

846
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,857
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth LP Album,
60,000 won"

847
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,759
Okay.

848
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:24,936
Hello?

849
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,739
I called because I saw what you're
selling on "Second-hand Market",

850
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,144
We're back.

851
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:34,445
Welcome back.

852
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:37,148
How was the business? Good?

853
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,674
It was a complete failure.

854
00:43:40,758 --> 00:43:42,653
Why? There weren't many customers?

855
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:44,245
Not one person came.

856
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,746
The competition for
food truck was so tough.

857
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:51,963
The others were spitting fire and
rainbows to attract customers.

858
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:54,765
I'm not sure if we're doing
business or running a circus.

859
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:57,468
This won't work.

860
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,564
Let's also do something.
A powerful performance!

861
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:01,739
What skill do we have
to do such performance?

862
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,242
It can't be helped then.

863
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,144
An eye for an eye,

864
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:07,945
an ear for an ear then.

865
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:18,594
What are you waiting for?

866
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,891
Hurry up and start.

867
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,793
But Yuri, do we have to do this?

868
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:23,794
I'm scared.

869
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,396
What are you scared of?

870
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,265
You succeeded at it one
time out of the five tries.

871
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:30,551
That's not important. What important
is that I failed four times!

872
00:44:30,665 --> 00:44:32,637
Why do you think of the failure first?

873
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:35,139
You might succeed again this time.

874
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:40,431
Besides, if we fail the business, your
investment would have been for nothing.

875
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:43,114
-So, hurry and do it.
-Darn it.

876
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,582
Okay.

877
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,597
I'm scared.

878
00:44:58,117 --> 00:45:00,431
What the heck? Did you just drink it?

879
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,700
Sorry. I'm too nervous.

880
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:05,703
-Gosh, do it again!
-Okay.

881
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,377
What the? Did you drink it again?

882
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:16,082
You're supposed to blow the fire.

883
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,949
Sorry, let me try again.

884
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,192
You're doing it again!

885
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:32,663
Stop drinking and blow the fire!

886
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,271
I told you to blow the fire,
why did you drink it all up?

887
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,673
What am I supposed to do when I'm scared?

888
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,077
Whatever. Just forget it.

889
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,378
Then,

890
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,082
let's pull up some rainbow
from your mouth then. Open wide.

891
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,786
Okay, pull it. Hurry up.

892
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:57,356
Spit it out.

893
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,827
-Did you swallow it again?
-I'm sorry.

894
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:05,763
I only wanted to swallow my saliva, but...

895
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,472
...it just got swallowed.

896
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,734
You stupid fool!

897
00:46:09,856 --> 00:46:11,936
Puke it out! Hurry!

898
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,682
-Gosh!
-Yuri, it's delicious.

899
00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:16,874
-Give me one more.
-What are you saying?

900
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,443
You're driving me crazy!

901
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:23,653
♪ If only I can see your smile

902
00:46:23,763 --> 00:46:30,888
♪ I can bear with any pain

903
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:37,161
♪ Please open your heart for me

904
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,766
What do you think?

905
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:43,434
The song is really good.

906
00:46:43,556 --> 00:46:44,535
The lyrics are great too.

907
00:46:44,657 --> 00:46:46,537
-It would be a big hit.
-Really?

908
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:49,874
Then, can you ask your company about it?

909
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:51,552
Of course!

910
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:52,743
Let's go at it one more time.

911
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:54,245
Okay, sure.

912
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,184
It's already here.

913
00:47:05,047 --> 00:47:07,058
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth Album"

914
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,459
Yes. This is the one.

915
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:12,563
Why is an old album so expensive?

916
00:47:13,387 --> 00:47:15,533
Wooshik would love receiving it.

917
00:47:19,157 --> 00:47:20,438
But what is this smell?

918
00:47:23,867 --> 00:47:25,376
The smell comes from here.

919
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:28,158
What is this?

920
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,047
"Roasted Seaweed"

921
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:31,449
Why is there a seaweed?

922
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:41,859
What are these?

923
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,662
Why are these inside here and not the LP?

924
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:46,864
"Roasted Seaweed"

925
00:47:47,186 --> 00:47:48,065
Wait a minute.

926
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,579
No way.

927
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,256
Kim.

928
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,542
Gwang.

929
00:47:58,943 --> 00:47:59,744
Seok.

930
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:01,598
Fourth Album.

931
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,181
Darn it!

932
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,185
This scammer!

933
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,802
How can such a scammer exist?

934
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:14,392
I just wasted my money!

935
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:17,825
Found it!

936
00:48:24,132 --> 00:48:25,116
Hello?

937
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,106
I'm calling you about Kim
Gwangseok's Fourth LP Album.

938
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,618
But is it really Kim Gwangseok's
Fourth Album? For real, right?

939
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,613
I'll buy that then.

940
00:48:36,436 --> 00:48:39,617
But instead of delivery,
I want to have it charged on delivery.

941
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:40,683
Charge on delivery.

942
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,487
-Guys, we're back.
-Welcome.

943
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:46,991
-We're here.
-Slowly! Slowly!

944
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,993
Fire!

945
00:48:50,577 --> 00:48:51,447
What's going on?

946
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,454
-What's wrong with Kibong?
-I don't know.

947
00:48:53,565 --> 00:48:55,166
So tiring.

948
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,267
He's reek of alcohol.

949
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:59,770
-Is he drunk?
-I don't know!

950
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:02,587
The business is completely
ruined because of Kibong.

951
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:03,274
What?

952
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,477
It has been days and we still don't
have customers. I'm only losing money.

953
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,313
What if we really go bankrupt.

954
00:49:09,398 --> 00:49:10,714
Darn it.

955
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,562
Gosh, this fool!

956
00:49:13,673 --> 00:49:16,654
-Jungi, take him to his room now.
-Okay.

957
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,356
Kibong, wake up!

958
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,026
-Take off your bag first.
-Wait a minute.

959
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,749
-I want to throw up.
-What?

960
00:49:24,939 --> 00:49:27,338
No, not here. Hold it in!

961
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:28,649
I can't hold it in.

962
00:49:28,744 --> 00:49:30,434
-No!
-Hey!

963
00:49:30,522 --> 00:49:31,614
-Hey Kibong!
-Oh my!

964
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,942
What the? What is he puking out?

965
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,044
-It came out.
-Why did the puke stop?

966
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,545
What to do?

967
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:44,909
What's this?

968
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:47,990
Kibong, what the heck?

969
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,800
Now it's purple.

970
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:52,311
Jeongeun, hold this.

971
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,228
Kibong, what's this? It's yellow now.

972
00:49:57,312 --> 00:49:58,444
Amazing!

973
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,662
Unbelievable!

974
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:03,147
Red!

975
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,530
What's next? It's green!

976
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:15,677
Is anyone home?

977
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:18,088
Is there anyone named Han Suyeon here?

978
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:18,769
What?

979
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,288
That's me.

980
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:22,989
I'm the person who sells Kim
Gwangseok's Fourth Album.

981
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:23,881
I see.

982
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,377
You're here?

983
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:27,855
Can I see the item first?

984
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:30,268
Here you go.

985
00:50:30,352 --> 00:50:31,866
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth Album"

986
00:50:32,752 --> 00:50:34,300
Let me check it first.

987
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:35,812
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth Album"

988
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:42,218
It's real this time.

989
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:46,363
Here you go.

990
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,157
Thank you.

991
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:50,749
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

992
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:55,083
I finally bought it.

993
00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:00,377
I used to like Kim Gwangseok's song too.

994
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:02,174
Should I listen to it first?

995
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:28,160
What's going on here?

996
00:51:30,073 --> 00:51:31,457
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth Album"

997
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:32,980
What's this?

998
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:40,032
Monk Kim Gwangseok's The
Heart Sutra's recitation...

999
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:41,435
Darn it!

1000
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:43,949
This jerk!

1001
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:45,683
Excuse me!

1002
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,202
Excuse me!

1003
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:56,831
Kibong, let's just finish up and go back.

1004
00:51:57,256 --> 00:51:58,123
So early?

1005
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:01,741
What's the use?
We don't have any customers.

1006
00:52:02,613 --> 00:52:04,123
Let's just go back.

1007
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:06,222
Let's stay a little longer.

1008
00:52:06,913 --> 00:52:07,834
Cheer up, Yuri.

1009
00:52:09,016 --> 00:52:10,113
Kibong...

1010
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,889
I'm sorry.

1011
00:52:12,514 --> 00:52:16,692
You even used up your last salary
and bought the food truck for me...

1012
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,629
This is embarrassing.

1013
00:52:18,714 --> 00:52:19,933
It's okay.

1014
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:21,624
We're just lacking in promotion.

1015
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,809
After some time,
the business will be good.

1016
00:52:24,134 --> 00:52:24,957
Cheer up!

1017
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,668
I might have thought that it
would be easier than it really is.

1018
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:33,362
Of course I'd do that.

1019
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:36,949
How can someone like me even
think of doing a business.

1020
00:52:37,812 --> 00:52:41,627
But Yuri, let's just give it one more try.

1021
00:52:42,145 --> 00:52:43,905
You worked so hard on it.

1022
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:46,185
You can't just give up like this.

1023
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,106
But there's no solution to it.

1024
00:52:50,922 --> 00:52:56,285
Yuri, let's forget about
spitting fire and rainbow.

1025
00:52:56,462 --> 00:52:59,479
Forget about all the cheap
tricks and focus on your food.

1026
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:01,918
Your spaghetti is really delicious.

1027
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:04,419
It's the best out of all
the spaghetti I ate before.

1028
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:08,013
-Really?
-Of course.

1029
00:53:08,113 --> 00:53:11,552
So, don't feel discouraged
and work on it together!

1030
00:53:13,054 --> 00:53:14,971
-Good!
-We can do it!

1031
00:53:15,071 --> 00:53:16,484
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

1032
00:53:17,082 --> 00:53:19,717
Welcome. We're Yuri's Kitchen 31!

1033
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:22,509
There are a total of 31
spaghetti you can choose from.

1034
00:53:22,593 --> 00:53:24,119
Try and have some.

1035
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:26,410
All our recipes were
developed by the best chef.

1036
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:29,838
Every dish is prepared on the spot.
The delicious, Yuri's Kitchen 31!

1037
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:31,119
Have some.

1038
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:35,424
Wooshik!

1039
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:36,220
Hey.

1040
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:37,518
Hey, wake up.

1041
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:38,913
-Okay.
-Good.

1042
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:40,200
Oh, hey.

1043
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,618
I fell asleep.

1044
00:53:44,996 --> 00:53:46,245
Why? What's wrong?

1045
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:49,767
-Who is she?
-Say hello.

1046
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:52,163
-She's our company's team leader.
-Hello.

1047
00:53:52,752 --> 00:53:55,368
I'm Kim Sujin, the Head of Strategy
for Flower Records.

1048
00:53:57,244 --> 00:53:58,987
Yes, hello.

1049
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:02,983
By the way, on what business are you...

1050
00:54:03,084 --> 00:54:06,176
I heard your song and it's really great.

1051
00:54:06,303 --> 00:54:09,774
-So I'd like to work with you.
-What?

1052
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:12,371
Does that mean you're
going to produce my album?

1053
00:54:12,473 --> 00:54:13,958
No, that's not what I meant.

1054
00:54:14,141 --> 00:54:17,059
We're debuting a new singer soon.

1055
00:54:17,143 --> 00:54:19,458
So, I think your songs
would suit her well.

1056
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:21,364
What do you mean?

1057
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:24,872
-Are you telling me to sell my song?
-Yes.

1058
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,469
Don't worry about how much you'll get.

1059
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:29,631
I don't have any thought of selling it.

1060
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,209
I'll take my leave then.

1061
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:33,312
Hey, wait.

1062
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:35,623
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1063
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:38,189
How can you walk out in the
middle of a conversation?

1064
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:39,983
I have nothing to say anymore.

1065
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,416
I didn't make that song to sell it.

1066
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,999
-I made it to sing it myself.
-I know, brat.

1067
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:46,601
I know how you feel.

1068
00:54:47,306 --> 00:54:49,909
But Wooshik, let's face it.

1069
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:52,925
No one in this country...

1070
00:54:53,212 --> 00:54:54,705
...would produce your album.

1071
00:54:55,613 --> 00:54:56,704
You know it too.

1072
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:01,025
This kind of chances don't come easily.

1073
00:55:01,221 --> 00:55:05,352
And if this song does well,
it will be good for you too.

1074
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,940
Then one day, you might get a
chance to produce your own album.

1075
00:55:09,062 --> 00:55:10,248
But still...

1076
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:11,853
Then are you going to let
that song go to waste?

1077
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:13,665
Are you going to keep on
singing it only in your room?

1078
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,648
Don't you want to let
others listen to it too?

1079
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:18,852
Hey, get a grasp of reality...

1080
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,852
...and stop being stubborn.

1081
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,313
Please have some.

1082
00:55:28,397 --> 00:55:30,183
We're Yuri's Kitchen 31.

1083
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,513
-Please have some.
-Try and have some.

1084
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:34,399
It's really delicious.
It gets more delicious at night.

1085
00:55:34,502 --> 00:55:35,984
We have delicious spaghetti.

1086
00:55:36,091 --> 00:55:38,880
Try and have some. Just a bit.

1087
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:40,972
Kibong...

1088
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,368
Let's stop now.

1089
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:48,775
What are you talking about?
We should keep trying.

1090
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,384
I've tried everything.

1091
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:51,678
Which is why...

1092
00:55:52,076 --> 00:55:53,576
...let's just go back home.

1093
00:55:54,363 --> 00:55:55,276
Yuri.

1094
00:55:55,472 --> 00:55:56,486
Yuri!

1095
00:55:57,569 --> 00:55:58,431
What the heck?

1096
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,636
What's wrong with it?

1097
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:05,037
I think it's been punctured.

1098
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:10,657
Why is nothing working out for me?

1099
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,147
It's just too much.

1100
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:14,953
We can just change the tyre.

1101
00:56:15,037 --> 00:56:18,006
I'll do it in no time,
so you can go ahead and rest. Okay?

1102
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:24,827
Gosh, this is tiring.

1103
00:56:25,528 --> 00:56:27,216
Why am I sweating so much?

1104
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,112
-So cool.
-So cool.

1105
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:01,816
-What's wrong?
-What?

1106
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:03,816
Well...

1107
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:05,211
What's delicious here?

1108
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:05,900
What?

1109
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:08,796
They're all delicious.
And there's various type of spaghetti.

1110
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,016
Check out the menu board.

1111
00:57:10,105 --> 00:57:11,219
-Yes.
-Okay.

1112
00:57:13,823 --> 00:57:15,737
What are you doing? We have customers.

1113
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:19,731
Why are they here so suddenly?
That's interesting.

1114
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:21,545
Everything has a reason.

1115
00:57:23,736 --> 00:57:24,921
What? Why are you smiling?

1116
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:26,747
What is it? You're scaring me.

1117
00:57:29,254 --> 00:57:31,547
"Yuri's Kitchen 31"

1118
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,973
Almond Vongole is ready.

1119
00:57:43,957 --> 00:57:45,400
This is so tiring.

1120
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:48,393
Why does she keep on
making me switch tires?

1121
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:51,091
Right, she told me to
drink water regularly.

1122
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:56,864
"Yuri's Kitchen 31"

1123
00:58:02,017 --> 00:58:03,069
Enjoy your meal.

1124
00:58:04,396 --> 00:58:05,899
You made the right decision.

1125
00:58:06,017 --> 00:58:08,292
How much do you have in mind for the song?

1126
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:10,119
You can handle that on your own.

1127
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:13,401
In exchange, I want to be in
charge of the producing of my song.

1128
00:58:13,517 --> 00:58:16,308
We'd be more than happy if you'd do that.

1129
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:20,217
By the way, who's the new singer
that will be singing my song?

1130
00:58:20,658 --> 00:58:21,884
Ma'am, I'm here.

1131
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:23,863
You're here? Introduce yourself.

1132
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:26,163
He's the songwriter that has
decided to give you his song.

1133
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:27,459
-Hello.
-Yes.

1134
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:29,991
Mr. Cha!

1135
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:32,988
Hey Minah!

1136
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,890
You will be the one singing my song?

1137
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:38,316
What? You two know each other?

1138
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:42,619
Yes. I used to receive vocal
training lessons from Mr. Cha.

1139
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:44,944
Mr. Cha, it's been a long time.

1140
00:58:45,028 --> 00:58:46,720
Exactly. It's been so long.

1141
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:49,730
Guys!

1142
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,863
We're home!

1143
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:54,647
What's up? Why do you look so happy?

1144
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:57,654
Our business went so well today.

1145
00:58:57,738 --> 00:58:59,046
We sold all the ingredients we prepared.

1146
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,843
-Really?
-Yes.

1147
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:04,748
This is all thanks to the cute Kibong.

1148
00:59:04,847 --> 00:59:05,913
What did Kibong do?

1149
00:59:06,115 --> 00:59:08,396
Mind your own business.
You don't have to know!

1150
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:10,311
So, how much did you make today?

1151
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,711
After excluding the prime
cost, costs for ingredients,

1152
00:59:12,818 --> 00:59:15,760
costs for the free tasting
event, and the gas,

1153
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:20,948
I have 1,000 won left.

1154
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,977
What? Just 1,000 won?

1155
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:26,762
But still, it's our first income!

1156
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:29,031
At least we're in the black.

1157
00:59:29,116 --> 00:59:32,117
Kibong, shall we have a party to
congratulate being in the black?

1158
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,847
Party? Should we?

1159
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,214
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1160
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:37,723
Oh yes, party!

1161
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:38,813
What party with 1,000 won?

1162
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:41,803
-We have 1,000 won left.
-So exciting!

1163
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:47,177
I went to all the second-hand LP
stores and finally found it.

1164
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:49,356
Gosh, so tiring.

1165
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:53,959
Bu Wooshik would feel happy
after seeing this, right?

1166
00:59:59,131 --> 01:00:01,034
Okay, thank you. Drive safely.

1167
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:03,119
-Wooshik...
-Mr. Cha.

1168
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:06,198
I guess we'd be seeing
each other more often then?

1169
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:08,508
That's not a good thing.
You know how picky I am, right?

1170
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:09,881
Of course I know.

1171
01:00:09,984 --> 01:00:11,796
You gave me a hard time back then.

1172
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:14,422
I didn't give you any hard time.
It's my affection for my student.

1173
01:00:14,718 --> 01:00:16,117
It's late, so go ahead.

1174
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:17,238
Already?

1175
01:00:17,938 --> 01:00:20,115
Mr. Cha, let's have coffee.

1176
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,817
What coffee at this time?

1177
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:24,337
What? It's not even nine yet.

1178
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,543
Let's go.

1179
01:00:25,643 --> 01:00:26,719
Goodness.

1180
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:28,926
I thought you didn't drink coffee?

1181
01:00:30,474 --> 01:00:32,036
"Kim Gwangseok's Fourth Album"

1182
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,617
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1183
01:00:43,735 --> 01:00:46,763
Kibong, you know...

1184
01:00:46,847 --> 01:00:50,814
I'm really going to try my
best for Yuri's Kitchen 31.

1185
01:00:51,118 --> 01:00:56,331
So, I'm going to open up a franchise and
open overseas business in the future.

1186
01:00:57,106 --> 01:00:59,100
Alright. Do your best!

1187
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:06,241
So, from now on, you need to try
your best at switching tires. Okay?

1188
01:01:06,341 --> 01:01:08,154
Okay. fine.

1189
01:01:08,238 --> 01:01:11,570
I will do my best at switching them.

1190
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:14,351
Kibong...

1191
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:16,822
Thank you.

1192
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:21,012
It's all thanks to you.

1193
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:26,739
I would have already given
up if it wasn't for you.

1194
01:01:27,327 --> 01:01:28,615
Really...

1195
01:01:29,425 --> 01:01:31,229
...really thank you.

1196
01:01:31,928 --> 01:01:34,296
Why are you being so cringey.

1197
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,081
Anyway, Yuri...

1198
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:40,102
I will do my best to
help you by your side,

1199
01:01:40,268 --> 01:01:43,123
so let's do this properly. Okay?

1200
01:01:43,437 --> 01:01:44,437
Cheer up!

1201
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:47,036
Okay.

1202
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:50,888
I always thought of you
as an immature little boy.

1203
01:01:50,977 --> 01:01:53,063
When did you grow up so much?

1204
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:55,770
You even know how to cheer me up now.

1205
01:01:57,778 --> 01:02:00,516
Kibong, you've grown up so much!

1206
01:02:00,606 --> 01:02:03,091
Who are you calling little?

1207
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:05,824
I'm 30 CM taller than you.

1208
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:10,781
But still, you will always
stay a little kid to me.

1209
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:14,858
So cute!

1210
01:02:14,968 --> 01:02:17,475
Gosh, stop it!

1211
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:44,091
Gosh, my head hurts.

1212
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,092
What's this?

1213
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,677
Where am I?

1214
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,115
Why does my room look so clean?

1215
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,206
Who is this?

1216
01:03:04,295 --> 01:03:06,399
So noisy!

1217
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:11,634
Kibong, I'm sleeping, so be quiet.

1218
01:03:35,634 --> 01:03:38,216
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1219
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:40,551
What's going on? Why are you here?

1220
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:41,858
Did we perhaps...

1221
01:03:41,975 --> 01:03:43,584
Yuri, we got a big problem! But who?

1222
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:44,956
Yuri, what do we do now?

1223
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:46,549
This is insane.

1224
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:47,537
Does Kibong like me?

1225
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,031
Does Yuri like me?

1226
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:52,727
It's a supporting character but I have
so many lines and I love the character!

1227
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:54,428
But will Lee Jungi be okay?

1228
01:03:54,528 --> 01:03:57,088
He said he won't do it
if we don't cast Jungi.

1229
01:03:57,189 --> 01:03:58,775
Those who pull the strings
are always the problem.

1230
01:03:58,883 --> 01:04:00,508
Please, sir...
