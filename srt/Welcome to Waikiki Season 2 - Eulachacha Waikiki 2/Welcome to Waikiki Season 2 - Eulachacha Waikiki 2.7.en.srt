1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:02,086
"On shoot. Neighborhood beggar, Cho Dalho"

2
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:07,705
What's wrong, director?

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,599
-Is there an issue?
-No, the make up is too...

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,991
-...clean for a beggar.
-Yes?

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,699
No,

6
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:18,786
-I've done my best.
-But something is missing.

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:19,898
Right.

8
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:21,311
Where is beggar 3?

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,061
-Beggar 3?
-I'm here!

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,098
Sorry for being late, sir.

11
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:51,194
-It took me awhile to do my makeup.
-Did you do it by yourself?

12
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:51,994
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:55,281
-Is it weird?
-No, not at all!

14
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,575
You look like a real beggar.

15
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,066
What's with this stroller?

16
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:04,358
I see beggars always have their stroller
to pick up waste papers or scrap irons.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,997
I've done some research.

18
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:09,909
You've done your research?
Wow, she is impressive!

19
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:12,394
What have you guys done?

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,505
If you are an actor,
you should be like her!

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,687
-Sorry, sir...
-Quiet!

22
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:20,075
Gosh, I like her!

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,363
You really look like a beggar.

24
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,868
How can it be so real?

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,867
-She's a beggar, beggar!
-Yes, she is.

26
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:27,755
Good, very good!

27
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:42,218
It was singer, Cha Wooshik.

28
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,514
Wooshik, have some of this.

29
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:53,435
-I enjoyed your song.
-Thank you.

30
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:55,824
-How's your work?
-It's fun.

31
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,623
-Thank you for introducing me this job.
-Don't say that.

32
00:01:58,705 --> 00:02:00,440
It's nothing, really.

33
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:02,535
Suyeon, can you clean that table?

34
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:03,835
Yes, sir!

35
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,035
What a bright girl, right?

36
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:09,362
Suyeon is bright,

37
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:12,862
diligent, meticulous, and perfectionism...

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,340
Didn't you say, she's perfectionism?

39
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:22,643
I said, she wants to be one.

40
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:28,392
The weather is so great now.

41
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,194
It really is spring, don't you think?

42
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,478
I guess so.

43
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,198
Why do you look so down?

44
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:38,286
Is it...

45
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,096
...because you broke a cup, just now?

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,789
Well, that could be the reason too.

47
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,893
I keep making mistakes.

48
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:46,072
Wooshik,

49
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:48,280
why am I like this?

50
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,224
I really wanted to do great job this time.

51
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:53,794
It's okay.
You can do a great job tomorrow.

52
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,707
Don't worry too much.

53
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:58,529
Okay.

54
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:00,743
Cheer up!

55
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:03,029
It's hotteok.

56
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:04,626
-Shall we have one?
-What?

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,519
Hotteok?

58
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:08,116
Hotteok sounds good! Let's go, Wooshik!

59
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,289
-Hello!
-Welcome.

60
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,981
Two hotteok, please.

61
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,289
Make it, three. I want to eat two!

62
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:18,996
Your girlfriend seems to like Hotteok.

63
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,495
Girlfriend?

64
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,496
-We are not in a relationship.
-Really?

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,997
You guys look good together,
so I thought you were a couple.

66
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,098
Couple?

67
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,007
Gee, why do you say that?

68
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:33,386
How can you think like that?

69
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:34,493
Darn it.

70
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:36,196
Give me all of these.

71
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,683
Hey,

72
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,795
how long are you going to look
at the pictures of beggars?

73
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,979
I'm doing my research!

74
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,280
I need to focus, so don't bother me.

75
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,566
Hi, everybody!

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,767
-Hey, you came.
-Hey, want some hotteok?

77
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,479
What?

78
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,083
Why so sudden?

79
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:05,997
-Are these all hotteoks?
-Yes.

80
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:08,569
Hotteok lady was so kind,

81
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:10,672
so I bought it all.

82
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,164
Why do you look so happy?

83
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,142
Something good happened?

84
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:17,036
It was his first day at work with Suyeon.

85
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:20,074
No wonder, you look so happy.

86
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:22,660
-Do you like her that much?
-Of course, I do!

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,349
How did you know?

88
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:26,365
-Jungi has told me everything.
-What?

89
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:30,745
-That was my secret. How could you tell...
-Don't worry, I'm not going to say a word.

90
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:31,937
Are you...

91
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:33,738
...that happy to be with Suyeon,

92
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,642
-all the time?
-Yes, I am.

93
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:39,139
We can go to work, off work,
and eat hotteok together...

94
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:39,931
Right.

95
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:43,526
The hotteok lady told us,
we look like a couple.

96
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,008
It made me blush!

97
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:50,818
Sir!

98
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,932
Hello, sir!

99
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,225
You came early.

100
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,234
-What's wrong with your face?
-After I listened to you,

101
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,726
I tried my best effort on
this make up and clothes.

102
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:03,026
-What do you think?
-It looks much better.

103
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,438
See, I told you.
You look like a real beggar.

104
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:06,636
Thank you, sir!

105
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,124
Beggars of beggars.

106
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,037
Where is our beggar queen?

107
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,425
I'm here, sir!

108
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,433
Who's that beggar?

109
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,851
Hello, sir.

110
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:30,913
This is why I like you so much!

111
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,023
You give me no choice.

112
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:34,619
Hey, producer.
Do we have any lines for Jeongeun?

113
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,557
Today's line for beggar is...

114
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:38,851
Only Jungi has it.

115
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:41,152
-Yes, yes.
-Give that to Jeongeun.

116
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:42,462
-Pardon? What the...

117
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:46,827
-It's okay, sir.
-No, I want to do something for you.

118
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,945
Do it as I say.

119
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,350
Jeongeun, let's go have some coffee.

120
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,845
-Producer, 5 minutes break.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,241
5 minutes break!

122
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,918
I'm sorry, Jungi.

123
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,340
No, it's okay.

124
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,626
Don't worry about me. Enjoy your coffee.

125
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,289
Okay, I will be right back.

126
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:09,288
So Jeongeun looks more
like a beggar than me? Okay.

127
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:13,446
I will show them,
what a real beggar looks like.

128
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:19,293
I will show them,
what a real beggar is!

129
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:28,724
What?

130
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,034
Suyeon, what are you doing?

131
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,931
The thing is...

132
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,434
The sink is backed up,
because I put food waste in there.

133
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:38,830
I see...

134
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,234
You should be more careful.

135
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:44,044
Hey, Cha Wooshik.

136
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,241
We need to talk.

137
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,233
I don't think...

138
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,693
-...we can have Suyeon around anymore.
-What?

139
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,995
What do you mean you
can't have Suyeon around?

140
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,209
-Does that mean you are going to fire her?
-Yes.

141
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,242
It's only been two days, but she already
broke 7 beer glasses and 5 plates.

142
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:05,242
And can't you see, it's all wet
because she made the sink backed up?

143
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,440
Still, you can't do that.

144
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:11,167
Suyeon will be devastated,
if she gets fired this time too.

145
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,453
-Please let her slide.
-I don't know.

146
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:17,165
Hello?

147
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:18,665
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:20,173
Pardon?

149
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,371
What did you say?

150
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,268
Understood, sir.

151
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,712
This is driving me crazy.

152
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:27,831
What's going on?

153
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,021
There's been a protest
due to rental issue.

154
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,506
And today, shop lot owners are
going to do "three steps, one bow",

155
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,299
till landlord's house.

156
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:38,013
-I'm worried they might hurt their knees.
-I see.

157
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:39,806
Bro!

158
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:41,711
What about this?

159
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:44,720
Vicious landlord...

160
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:46,339
...should be gone!

161
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:49,116
-Should be gone!
-Should be gone!

162
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,400
Gee, this is killing me.

163
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,891
We will never reach the house.

164
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:02,597
But I have no choice.

165
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,391
As long as I do my "three
steps, one bow" for them,

166
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,377
they promised to keep Suyeon.

167
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:08,298
So I need to it until the end.

168
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,298
Let's do this!

169
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:14,278
Let's go to landlord's house
by "three steps, one bow"!

170
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:17,254
Vicious landlord should be gone!

171
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:20,544
-Should be gone!
-Should be gone!

172
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:27,525
Oh my, I guess they are
protesting for rental fee.

173
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:31,215
I don't know how they want
self-employees to live.

174
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:52,080
Look at that punk.

175
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,745
Darn it.

176
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:03,527
What?

177
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:04,932
Where did he go?

178
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,044
Who are you?
Why do you keep following me?

179
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,743
-Who sent you?
-Sir...

180
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:13,440
-Sir, that's not it...
-Don't tell me,

181
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,751
you are here to steal my stroller?

182
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,319
I can't let that happen.
It's all I've got!

183
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:19,628
No, sir. No!

184
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,127
-It's not like that.
-What?

185
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,940
So you are an actor,

186
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:26,543
-and now you have role for a beggar?
-Yes.

187
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:28,440
I want to know how beggars...

188
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:29,431
I mean...

189
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,923
I want to experience how Mr. beggars live.

190
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,519
So I can do more realistic act.

191
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:36,567
Why does it have to be me?

192
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,661
I've been to Seoul,
Yongsan and other stations,

193
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,178
and you were the most realistic beggar.

194
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,384
-What did you say?
-Sir, I mean...

195
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,650
I mean you are the most professional one.
Yes, that's what I mean.

196
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,226
You are right.

197
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,224
When I...

198
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,684
-...do something, I do my best.
-I see.

199
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:02,573
Sir,

200
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:04,271
teach me this once.

201
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,944
I'm begging you!

202
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:12,263
I understand how you feel,

203
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,181
but I'm too busy with my own life.

204
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,577
Look for other person.

205
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:19,069
Sir.

206
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,267
Sir!

207
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,172
Geez, it's killing me.

208
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,061
It's killing me. Darn, it's cold.

209
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:25,958
Gee, it's killing me.

210
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,155
My head, shoulder, arm and legs...

211
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,307
-Oh, my...
-How can he...

212
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:34,505
...not even open the door, when we
visit him with "three steps, one bow"?

213
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,211
I guess we need to do
more intense protest.

214
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,713
Do you guys have any ideas?

215
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:41,307
Well, why don't we write
something in blood?

216
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:42,902
-Write in blood?
-Yes.

217
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:44,704
Write in blood, you say?

218
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,960
I think that's a great idea!

219
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:48,674
Blood?

220
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,563
Will that work?

221
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,753
Shouldn't we go for hunger strike?

222
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,023
That's great, too!

223
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,031
Then,

224
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,037
let's do both of them. Both!

225
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,337
Both?

226
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,626
-Gee, they are driving me crazy!
-Let's do this!

227
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:07,933
Hey, it's Wooshik.

228
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:09,029
Yes,

229
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,046
I'm done with "three steps, one bow".

230
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:13,228
But they are willing to write in blood...

231
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,678
...and hunger strike, too!
What should I do?

232
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:17,297
Well, you have no choice.

233
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,177
-You should do it.
-What? Me?

234
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,891
Bro!

235
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,686
I don't think that's what I should do!

236
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,575
Suyeon!

237
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,339
-Did you break another plate?
-Sorry, sir.

238
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:33,046
-Gosh, you are driving me crazy!
-I'm so sorry.

239
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:35,843
-So what? You can't do it?
-I mean...

240
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:37,556
That's not what I'm saying.

241
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,857
Of course I should do.

242
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,830
Even though Suyeon makes mistake,

243
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,432
give her a break.

244
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:45,424
Okay.

245
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,131
Okay, thanks.

246
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,939
-Gosh, I'm going crazy.
-Let's...

247
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,043
...write in blood first.

248
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,301
You should too. Live Cafe boy.

249
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,991
Fill it up, tightly.

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,689
Pardon?

251
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,586
I need to fill it up?

252
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:22,008
Mother,

253
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,596
I miss you.

254
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,017
"Dear Landlord,
I was poor since I was young."

255
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:26,700
"I never dined out, when everyone has.
When my mother went out for work,"

256
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:30,804
"I ate instant noodle all alone at home."

257
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,275
"When instant noodle got bored,"

258
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,859
"I talked back to my mother
to eat something nice."

259
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:48,185
"Then she ordered jjajangmyeon
with money she saved."

260
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:51,476
"I was so happy over one
plate of jjajangmyeon."

261
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:59,751
"My mother told me,
she doesn't like jjajangmyeon."

262
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,938
"I absolutely opposed."

263
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:13,285
I...

264
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:14,078
I've...

265
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:15,880
I've completed, finally.

266
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:18,475
I'm dizzy.

267
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,451
Hey, Wooshik.

268
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:30,252
Suyeon, what are you doing here?

269
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,260
Boss told me you are doing hunger strike.

270
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,845
-Why are you doing it?
-Yes?

271
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,542
-The thing is...
-Boss has forced you, right?

272
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:41,645
-Should I say something to him?
-No, don't do it. Never.

273
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:43,829
He didn't force me.

274
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,440
I just wanted to do it.

275
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:48,722
I am very interested in rental issue.

276
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:49,937
Really?

277
00:13:50,422 --> 00:13:51,444
Yes.

278
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,842
So don't worry about me,

279
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,432
and focus on your work.

280
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:57,427
Don't let boss have his eye on you.

281
00:13:58,316 --> 00:13:59,720
Okay, understood.

282
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:03,223
-Take care, okay?
-Okay.

283
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:11,455
-I'm going crazy.
-I think,

284
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,059
we are done with writing in blood.

285
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,954
So let's start with hunger strike!

286
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,344
-Master!
-You scared me!

287
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:46,534
You again?

288
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:49,042
How many times do I need to tell you no?

289
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,955
-Go back.
-I can't, sir!

290
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:52,854
I'm not going to move,

291
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,654
-until you approve.
-Whatever.

292
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,654
Wait, sir.

293
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,559
Master! Sir...

294
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,231
I fell asleep before I knew.

295
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:47,722
Come in.

296
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:52,834
-Master.
-I lost.

297
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:54,127
So come in.

298
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,366
Thank you, sir.

299
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,779
Thank you. Thank...

300
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:04,867
Please wait for me...

301
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,927
Wear this first.

302
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:25,841
-I need to wear this?
-Why?

303
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:28,446
-Is it too dirty for you?
-No, it's not like that...

304
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,832
Didn't you say,
you want to experience our life?

305
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:32,514
If you can't even put up with that,

306
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,625
you may give up now.

307
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,423
No, no!

308
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:40,319
I will wear it. I will!

309
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,970
-It fits you perfectly.
-Yes.

310
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,565
I bet you didn't even have your
dinner, yet. You must be hungry.

311
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,569
Here.

312
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,268
Eat this.

313
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,371
Thank you, sir.

314
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,656
But, sir... There's dirt.

315
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:07,854
-Too dirty for you?
-No, I mean...

316
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:10,061
There is a saying in our world.

317
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,351
"Don't be afraid of picking up and eat."

318
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,851
"Hunger is much more scary."

319
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:19,686
-If you still can't eat it, just go home.
-No, no.

320
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:21,289
I will eat it.

321
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,194
I will eat it, sir.

322
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,955
Eat it and get some sleep.

323
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,661
The real class will...

324
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,256
-...start from tomorrow morning.
-Yes, sir.

325
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,628
Have a good night, sir.

326
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:48,239
Okay.

327
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:49,917
I will see you tomorrow.

328
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,012
Sorry?

329
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,300
I see how Cinderella became mozzarella.

330
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:58,899
-It's so funny.
-Right?

331
00:17:59,008 --> 00:17:59,911
Right?

332
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:10,113
You should get some sleep.
It's getting late. Yes.

333
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:15,122
-Gee, he's driving me crazy.
-Is it because of his laugh?

334
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,328
-You said he's fine except his laugh.
-I know but,

335
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,822
I can't get used to it.

336
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:22,355
By the way,

337
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,062
-how's your fork ball going?
-Great.

338
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,347
Thanks to Byungchul, I'm getting better.

339
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,243
That's a good news.

340
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:32,961
What are you searching for?

341
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,263
I told you,
I'm going to open a restaurant.

342
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:38,539
I was wondering, what should I
do with Yuri's Kitchen interior.

343
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,046
Yuri's Kitchen?

344
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,438
-You mean, the fried chicken restaurant.
-What do you mean fried chicken?

345
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:45,923
Hey.

346
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,732
It's Yuri's Kitchen. Kitchen!

347
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,816
Yes, Yuri's Chicken. Chicken!

348
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,014
By the way,

349
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:55,614
-what does "Yuri's" mean?
-Never mind, never mind.

350
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,833
Why do I even mention it to you?

351
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,870
"Oppose in increasing rental fee.
Hunger strike for 2 days."

352
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,176
Gee, I'm so hungry.

353
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,550
How long do I have to do this?

354
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,248
Should I just quit?

355
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:12,645
No, no.

356
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:14,654
I should do this until the end...

357
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,161
...for Suyeon.

358
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:17,146
I should!

359
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,249
Let's do this!

360
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:21,147
Let's starve myself,

361
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,759
until he lowers the rental fee!

362
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,854
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

363
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:33,565
This is the perfect spot.

364
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,843
There's transient population,
and restaurants nearby.

365
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,841
I bet there's many
people who have change.

366
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:38,748
This is perfect.

367
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:39,848
Shall we...

368
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:42,357
...start our business?

369
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:47,217
Yes, master.

370
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:53,618
-What are you doing?
-Pardon?

371
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:57,349
Is this not it?

372
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,463
There is a saying in our world.

373
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,058
"Don't bend your back,"

374
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:02,843
"shake their heart instead."

375
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:06,344
The main point of beggary is
shaking people's heart.

376
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:06,946
How...

377
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,263
-...do we need to do that?
-Eye contact.

378
00:20:09,462 --> 00:20:11,857
Eye contact is the most important skill.

379
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,863
The main point of eye contact is...

380
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:15,465
...the look of your eyes.

381
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:19,767
The look that,
you can't stand without opening...

382
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:20,835
...a wallet.

383
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,297
So what kind of look is that?

384
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,606
-I will show you the demonstration.
-Yes, sir.

385
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:28,994
Do you see it?

386
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,082
The hollow look that you can't
even find slight bit of...

387
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:34,785
...hope.

388
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:38,598
The heartbreaking look that you
will be collapsed in anytime...

389
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,464
...without a help.

390
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,699
-I get it, sir.
-Then,

391
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:47,111
-why don't you give it a try?
-Yes, sir.

392
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,616
No, that's not it!

393
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:55,013
I still can see hope in your eyes.

394
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,702
Do you have money inside of your pocket?

395
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,234
Yes, I do.

396
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,337
-I knew it!
-What the...

397
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,331
People...

398
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:06,538
...tend to have hope,
when they have money in their pocket.

399
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:10,191
-Try again, now.
-Yes, master.

400
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,294
No, no!

401
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:15,188
That's not what I'm talking about!

402
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,196
What are you good at?

403
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,018
You can't even get a
proper role until that age.

404
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:24,739
How can you act,
when you can't even do what I taught you?

405
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:28,230
You are more pathetic than me, okay?

406
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:32,206
Yes, that's the look.

407
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,397
The look that, you can't
even find slight bit of hope.

408
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:38,010
Remember that look.

409
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,120
Do you understand?

410
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,217
-Yes, master.
-Good.

411
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:46,095
Shall we begin our business?

412
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:54,533
"Hunger strike for 3 days."

413
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:57,755
"Strongly oppose! Withdraw immediately!"
"Hunger strike for 4 days."

414
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:01,446
"Withdraw immediately!"
"Hunger strike for 5 days."

415
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:04,479
"Guarantee store's right to live!"

416
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,359
No...

417
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:07,264
I can't.

418
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:08,566
I can't cross.

419
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:15,088
Dear, please don't cross that river.

420
00:22:19,995 --> 00:22:21,995
Gosh, it was a dream.

421
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,606
I thought, I was going to die.

422
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:26,409
Jeez, so hungry.

423
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,719
What if I'm really going to die?

424
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,111
Is there any food?

425
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:39,540
Master, master!

426
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,834
Look, look! It's bread!

427
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:49,719
The convenient store gave it to
me, because it passed its expiry date.

428
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,035
It only passed three days!

429
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,829
Good job.

430
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,431
Why there's only four, when I got five?

431
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:03,087
I think I dropped it somewhere.

432
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,388
-Where did it go?
-It's fine.

433
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,284
-Let's get back to work.
-Yes, sir.

434
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:11,797
What kind of crappy beggar stole it?

435
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:14,195
Eat and get food poisoning!

436
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,194
Still there's four breads.

437
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,250
Thank you!

438
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,649
-It's getting late. We should move.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:23:45,753 --> 00:23:49,045
Let's see how much we have made today.

440
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,179
Oh, my!

441
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,386
Did you make that much?

442
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,003
It's all thanks to you, sir.

443
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,201
-You are now better than me.
-No, sir.

444
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:05,077
It's time to stop.

445
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:08,879
Sir...

446
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:13,275
-What do you mean...
-There's nothing left to teach you.

447
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,283
You...

448
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:16,292
...are a real beggar, no matter what.

449
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,498
You look even more like a beggar than me.

450
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:19,687
So...

451
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:21,593
...go back.

452
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:24,498
-Master...
-If you never forget about this moment,

453
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:25,481
you...

454
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,585
...will be the best in Korea, no.

455
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:31,119
You will be the best
beggar actor in the world.

456
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:32,412
Yes.

457
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:35,317
I will keep that in mind.

458
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,420
Thanks for...

459
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,806
....everything, master.

460
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,701
-Please accept my bow.
-No...

461
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,611
You don't need to thank me.

462
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,697
I guess this is our last
time to see each other.

463
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:56,792
I have one present for you.

464
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:58,300
Yes?

465
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,885
A present?

466
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:04,988
-Wow
-Jeongeun.

467
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:07,992
-Isn't this fertilizer sack?
-Yes, it is.

468
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,905
Fertilizer sack is warmest vinyl.

469
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:15,808
Wow, you are real queen...

470
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:16,602
No,

471
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:18,499
you are the god of beggar!

472
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,895
Wait,

473
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,603
where is Lee Jungi?

474
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:25,272
I'm not sure.
I can't get in contact with him.

475
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:26,755
I'm here!

476
00:25:47,064 --> 00:25:49,064
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

477
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:53,197
What happened to you? You seem different.

478
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:56,111
-Do I?
-Yes.

479
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:59,508
-I thought real beggar was entering.
-Hey, Lee Jungi.

480
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,672
What were you doing all this time?

481
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,680
I was having my acting lesson, no.

482
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:08,671
I was having my life lesson.

483
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:09,771
What?

484
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:14,062
"Neighborhood beggar, Cho Dalho"

485
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,180
This scene is about,

486
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,836
while beggars are begging,

487
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,461
beggar 1 comes with a bread
and beggars start to fight for it.

488
00:26:21,564 --> 00:26:23,770
-Yes, sir.
-Get prepared!

489
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,158
Ready,

490
00:26:26,564 --> 00:26:27,745
action!

491
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:32,684
How did a lawyer like me become like this?

492
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:35,994
-It doesn't make sense!
-What are you doing, mister?

493
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:37,787
Aren't you going to beg for money?
Get down!

494
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,802
Yes, yes.

495
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,503
There's a saying in our world.

496
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:49,765
"Don't bend your back,
shake their heart instead."

497
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:50,895
Their heart!

498
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,739
Eye contact! Eye contact is
the most important skill.

499
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,842
The main point of eye contact is...

500
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:58,739
...the look of your eyes.

501
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,130
What's wrong with Jungi?
Why isn't he getting down?

502
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:04,224
Hey, leave it. It looks fine.

503
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,412
Look at his eyes.

504
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:14,126
Hey guys, I got some bread.
Let's share it.

505
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,954
-Bread!
-Hold on, hold on!

506
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,633
That bread is for me! I need to eat!

507
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:26,028
Wait, hold on! You guys are ruining it!

508
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:28,553
Hey, let it go!

509
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:37,056
There's a saying in our world.

510
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,737
"Don't be afraid of picking up and eat."

511
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,738
"Hunger is much more scary."

512
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,841
Please don't eat it.

513
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:50,715
Camera.

514
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:52,120
Zoom in on Lee Jungi.

515
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:03,765
Okay, cut!

516
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:06,530
Very good, very good!

517
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:11,237
Lee Jungi's acting was really good!

518
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:13,549
Don't overpraise me, sir.

519
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:15,152
What do you mean?

520
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:18,548
-But you didn't have to eat that bread.
-No!

521
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:22,068
A real beggar should be able to
eat any dirty things...

522
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:24,181
...to avoid hunger!

523
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,406
You became whole lot different
person over few days.

524
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,828
You guys should learn.

525
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:34,910
He's a real actor!

526
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:36,707
Give him an applause!

527
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:46,293
No, sir. No.

528
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,174
No, please stop.

529
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:54,576
"Hunger strike for 6 days."

530
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:58,215
Excuse me, sir.
Can we stop with hunger strike?

531
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,017
-We all are going to die like this!
-Yes.

532
00:29:01,104 --> 00:29:04,396
What is the point of this,
when landlord doesn't care.

533
00:29:05,104 --> 00:29:06,402
Understood.

534
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:07,799
But...

535
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:10,094
...we can't just back down like this.

536
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:11,497
Okay, then.

537
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,314
Is there any other strike
than hunger strike?

538
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:15,703
Well...

539
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:18,013
What about shaving our heads?

540
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:19,703
Shaving our heads?

541
00:29:19,815 --> 00:29:21,115
That's a good idea!

542
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:22,809
Shave?

543
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,111
What shave?

544
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:25,714
What do they mean?

545
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,290
I don't think it's right
to shave all of ours.

546
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,979
Let's shave one's as a representative.

547
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:32,288
Is there any...

548
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:34,686
...volunteer?

549
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:39,284
No one?

550
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:44,380
What should I do?
Is there any way to pick fairly?

551
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,474
Why don't you let me handle it?

552
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:49,568
Yes, master of events for twins, Mr. Park.

553
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,681
-Do you have any good idea?
-I once...

554
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:54,068
...worked in children's camp.

555
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:56,813
When we need to pick one among the others,

556
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,505
"Noticed game" is the best.

557
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:01,910
That's a great idea!

558
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,253
Come on, everyone. Stand up.

559
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,547
-Come on, stand up.
-Yes.

560
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:11,955
You all know what "Noticed game"
is, right?

561
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:15,372
Lost one needs to shave head.
Let's start, when I say "start".

562
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:16,178
Start. One!

563
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:19,537
How can you start right after... Two!

564
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:20,347
What?

565
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:22,133
What's this? What is going on?

566
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:25,037
You guys are so petty!
You guys should play fairly... Three.

567
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:28,757
-Four.
-Four.

568
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:32,043
You guys lost!

569
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:36,756
Live cafe boy and Ms. Kim
from Sookhui salon!

570
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,049
Why did you sit at number four?

571
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,850
Now, now. We need to
pick one from two of you.

572
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:43,755
-What shall we do?
-No need to worry.

573
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:46,033
We have "Tangsuyuk game".

574
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:49,030
You guys know how to play it,

575
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:50,134
right?

576
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:54,732
Then, get ready.

577
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,042
Start!

578
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,145
-Tang.
-Su.

579
00:30:59,242 --> 00:30:59,943
-Yuk.
-Tang.

580
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:00,353
-Su.
-Yuk.

581
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:01,640
-Tang!
-Tang...

582
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,698
No!

583
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:15,595
Now,

584
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,212
We are...

585
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:21,905
...going to start with shaving head...

586
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:25,417
...to oppose on unfair
increase of rental fee.

587
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:27,563
"Strongly oppose on increasing rental fee.
Landlord should withdraw immediately."

588
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:31,451
Shall we...

589
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,660
...start?

590
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:34,248
Give me a moment.

591
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:36,891
I'd like to make a call for the last time.

592
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,902
Hello? Bro, it's me.

593
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,290
Look,

594
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:50,703
they want me to shave my head bald.

595
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:53,923
What did you say?

596
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:55,106
Hold on.

597
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,606
Mister! This way, this way!

598
00:31:58,012 --> 00:32:00,304
Suyeon started a file,
while working in the kitchen.

599
00:32:00,415 --> 00:32:02,201
Firefighters are here, now.

600
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:04,718
What did you say? What about shaving head?

601
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,520
I will do it.

602
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,934
I say, I will shave my head.

603
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:13,830
Gosh.

604
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,419
You may start.

605
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:20,510
Ms. Kim from Sookui salon
at 3rd floor will perform...

606
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,231
...shaving young man's head.

607
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,710
"Absolutely oppose on
increasing rental fee!"

608
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:33,760
I will shave it right away.

609
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:01,154
Hold on! Please stop!

610
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:05,147
-Who are you?
-I'm the landlord's lawyer.

611
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:08,510
Landlord will withdraw
rental fee increase.

612
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:11,495
So please stop!

613
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:13,711
What? Oh, my.

614
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:16,205
Oh, my. What the...

615
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:17,722
-My goodness.
-Are you...

616
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:20,816
-...certain?
-I said, I am!

617
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:22,919
Everybody,

618
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:25,825
rental fee increase will be withdrawn!

619
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,622
-We have won!
-We won!

620
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:34,706
Why didn't you say 7 minutes earlier?

621
00:33:34,803 --> 00:33:36,803
What is this?

622
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,508
What the heck is this?

623
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:46,009
"Waikiki"

624
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:50,234
Look at you. Shaving head for Suyeon
and now got a hole middle of your hair.

625
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:52,712
What a pure love.

626
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,512
Hey.

627
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,514
Are you joking with me?
It's already making me crazy.

628
00:33:57,531 --> 00:33:58,720
Darn you.

629
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:01,116
Hey, Suyeon.

630
00:34:01,912 --> 00:34:03,013
Wooshik.

631
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:08,321
What's up?

632
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,813
-How are you feeling?
-I'm fine.

633
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,623
What is that?

634
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,799
This?

635
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:19,109
I searched that, it is not good for
your stomach to eat rice after fast.

636
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:21,896
So I made a porridge.
Would you like to try?

637
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:23,100
What? Porridge?

638
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,685
-Thanks, Suyeon.
-No problem.

639
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:31,483
You even introduced the part-time job.

640
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:33,860
Enjoy it.

641
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,433
Hey, look at this.

642
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:46,044
-Suyeon made porridge for me!
-Geez.

643
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:47,846
You were so upset a minute ago.

644
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:50,044
-Are you that happy?
-Yes, I am. Super duper.

645
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:53,580
I don't care if my whole hair is gone.

646
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,891
She made a porridge for me. For me!

647
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:58,105
How am I going to eat Suyeon's porridge?

648
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,008
But I should give it a try at least.

649
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,021
Wow!

650
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,213
It's terrible.

651
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:12,109
How can it be so terrible?

652
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:14,324
Still, I love it so much!

653
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:21,700
Jungi,

654
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:25,001
-I've learned a lot from you, today.
-What do you...

655
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:26,414
-...mean?
-Actually,

656
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:28,901
I saw that bread on the floor.

657
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:32,884
-But I couldn't think of eating it.
-Geez, it's nothing.

658
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:36,196
By the way, Jeongeun.

659
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,895
The real act is...

660
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,887
...not about who you act.

661
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:43,949
I think real act is
being the actual person.

662
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:45,650
So,

663
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,553
if you want to act as a beggar,

664
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:53,024
you need to be a real beggar
in order to act like a beggar.

665
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,223
This is...

666
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:56,839
...the difference of
professional and amateur.

667
00:35:57,212 --> 00:35:58,218
Sir.

668
00:35:58,418 --> 00:35:59,814
I think this is too much.

669
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:01,031
What about it?

670
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,856
It's too dirty. What kind of beggar
eats food on the floor nowadays?

671
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,261
Our drama will be aired during meal time.
It might cause complaints.

672
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:09,847
You think so?

673
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,604
It's disgusting like you said.

674
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,905
Just edit it out.

675
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:13,593
No,

676
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:16,793
-just edit the whole scene he's in it.
-Okay.

677
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,398
"Delete"

678
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,091
Acting shouldn't be...

679
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,281
...ended with research.

680
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:24,987
You need to meet the
person who's in that field,

681
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:28,612
and have a meal together,
sleep together, and live together.

682
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:32,188
Only then, you can act like a real beggar.

683
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:34,713
-I see.
-This is called...

684
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:37,150
...a method acting. Method.

685
00:36:37,246 --> 00:36:38,339
You got it?

686
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:39,444
What does it call?

687
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:41,261
-Method...
-Yes, method.

688
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:46,305
How is it?

689
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,529
-Are you enjoying your steak?
-Yes.

690
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:49,710
It's good.

691
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,711
I'm sorry, I couldn't call you often.

692
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:56,291
I had to do my training, and I'm
preparing something. So I was busy.

693
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:57,885
Preparing something?

694
00:36:58,386 --> 00:37:01,289
It's a secret. I will tell you later.

695
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:03,195
Sure.

696
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:07,090
By the way, is Kibong doing
great on fork ball or something?

697
00:37:07,193 --> 00:37:09,795
Well, I do teach him. But I'm not sure.

698
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:11,692
He's too dumb.

699
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:13,995
Please...

700
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,107
...teach him well.

701
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:17,511
Understood.

702
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,416
Yuri, eat up before it gets cold.

703
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:20,193
Okay.

704
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,512
Gosh, he is much better
without the stupid laugh.

705
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:35,501
I'm sorry. The pepper is making me sneeze.

706
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,750
What the hell? What's going on?

707
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:43,354
What? What's wrong with his sneeze?

708
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:45,465
Oh, god. I need to drink some water.

709
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,518
What? What is it, now?

710
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:54,923
Don't tell me,

711
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:56,924
it's his hiccup.

712
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:02,746
What kind of human is he?

713
00:38:12,004 --> 00:38:15,098
-Hey, Kook Kibong.
-Coach.

714
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:17,994
-Do you know what time it is?
-Well...

715
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,495
-I have few things to practice.
-By the way,

716
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:22,606
wasn't that fork ball?

717
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:23,646
Yes.

718
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:26,829
You told me last time to
add some breaking balls,

719
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:29,931
-so I've been practicing.
-Is that so?

720
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,888
You seem to throw it well.

721
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:34,910
I love how it turns too.

722
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:35,909
Right.

723
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,111
Will it be okay...

724
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,698
-...for your injured shoulder?
-Yes, sir.

725
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,202
It's perfectly fine.

726
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:46,464
Okay. Then why don't you pitch to me?

727
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:48,162
Yes, coach.

728
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,231
So he hiccuped like a cuckoo?

729
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,004
If that is the only issue,
I wouldn't even mention.

730
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,996
Do you know how he sneezes?

731
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:24,290
Meow, meow.

732
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,695
He sneezes like this! Anyway,

733
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:27,901
I can't take this anymore.

734
00:39:27,988 --> 00:39:30,591
-I'm going to break up with him!
-What about Kibong?

735
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,537
He's not going to teach him,
after you break up with him.

736
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,828
Right...

737
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:35,831
I forgot about it.

738
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:38,135
Geez. In any case,

739
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,526
-he is no help.
-Hey, hey!

740
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:44,750
-Big news, big news!
-What's wrong?

741
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:47,526
-What is all the fuss about?
-Guys,

742
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:49,940
I got a test for first player again!

743
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:53,651
Coach saw me practicing and he
contacted first players' coach.

744
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:54,754
He will come and test me.

745
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:57,659
-Really? That is so great!
-Wait a minute.

746
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,155
-So I don't need to see Byungchul, right?
-What?

747
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,382
Is Byungchul that bad?

748
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:08,388
I don't know. Anyway, I'm going to
break up with Byungchul tomorrow!

749
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:10,777
Why do you look so happy? Yuri.

750
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:12,579
Yuri, Yuri!

751
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,466
Gosh.

752
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,871
What am I going to say to Byungchul?

753
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:26,172
Who are you? What are you doing?

754
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,475
Pervert!

755
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:33,333
After I took shower,
that pervert was smelling my clothes.

756
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:36,311
This is crazy. Where did he come from?

757
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:38,007
When did he come inside?

758
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,709
-I'm back.
-You are here.

759
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,114
What?

760
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:45,304
-What's going on? Something happened?
-The thing is...

761
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,535
A pervert appeared in girls' dormitory.

762
00:40:47,623 --> 00:40:49,051
Pervert?

763
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:50,542
So...

764
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,147
-...have we caught him?
-No.

765
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,725
He ran away so fast. Oh, my gosh!

766
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,996
-Isn't it a snake?
-Yes, it is.

767
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,917
It's a pet of a director I know.

768
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:01,504
He had to leave to overseas
for location scouts.

769
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,710
So I agree to look after it for few days.

770
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:04,843
You shouldn't bring it here.

771
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:07,129
How can I say no,
when he asked me a favor.

772
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:08,351
Don't worry.

773
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:11,129
Anne Hathaway Scarlett Johansson
Mega Fox Jr. is gentle.

774
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:11,829
What?

775
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:13,525
-Anne Hath... What?
-It's her name.

776
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:15,422
Director took the names
from his favorite actresses.

777
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,224
Is that so?

778
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,690
-Are you sure, she doesn't have venom?
-Venom?

779
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,470
What venom...
Yes, she does. A bit.

780
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,095
But it will not kill you.

781
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,890
Pervert issue is already pain in the
ass, and you had to bring a snake.

782
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,561
Don't worry, you jerk!
I will take care of her well.

783
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:33,069
Okay. Shall Anne Hathaway Scarlett
Johansson Megan Fox Jr. have some dinner?

784
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,457
Dinner time!

785
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:35,965
Dinner time!

786
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:42,893
"5:00 am Alarm"

787
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,725
Gee, it's already 5am.

788
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,793
I shall go for training.

789
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,251
What are you going to do?
You said, you will take care of it.

790
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:16,959
I didn't expect her to
open the box and come out.

791
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:18,663
Gee, I will be in trouble,
if director finds out...

792
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,163
That is not the issue!

793
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:21,905
What if customers ever see it?

794
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,325
You are right.
The pervert is already troubling us.

795
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:25,913
And it will be a bigger
issue, if snake appears.

796
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,713
It's not just an issue. If words start
spreading, our store will be busted.

797
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:30,619
Hey,

798
00:42:30,721 --> 00:42:33,030
-let's find the snake first.
-Got it.

799
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:36,332
-Lee Jungi, that punk.
-Darn it...

800
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:38,506
Anne Hathawy.

801
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,308
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

802
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,412
What are you doing?
Are you guys hunting for treasure?

803
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:46,928
Yuri, we are in trouble!

804
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,420
-Snake that Jungi brought has gone.
-What?

805
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,420
-How come?
-I don't know.

806
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:53,325
Come and help us find the snake.

807
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:56,925
Sorry, but I need to
go and meet Byungchul.

808
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:59,240
I told you,
I'm going to break up with Byungchul.

809
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:03,437
-How is that important?
-It is the most important thing to me!

810
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:05,041
Well,

811
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:06,240
good luck.

812
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:08,475
Yuri, Yuri!

813
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:10,376
Gee, she's so cheap.

814
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:12,884
Anne Hathaway Megan Fox...

815
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:14,495
Darn it, I don't know.

816
00:43:15,582 --> 00:43:17,002
Come inside first.

817
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:19,487
Look, Byungchul.
I have something to tell you.

818
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:21,184
We can talk about it later.

819
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:22,480
Come and look.

820
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:25,783
Where are we?

821
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,009
-This is the restaurant, that I bought.
-Pardon?

822
00:43:30,296 --> 00:43:34,002
-And why are you showing me this?
-I was thinking of...

823
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:36,897
...opening a restaurant
with close friends.

824
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:39,236
I will be retired soon,

825
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:41,561
so I bought it for my future.

826
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:42,952
I see...

827
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:44,458
Byungchul, I have...

828
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:46,366
-...something to tell you.
-So I was thinking,

829
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:47,849
why don't you...

830
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:50,255
...take charge of this
restaurant's kitchen?

831
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,564
Sorry?

832
00:43:51,644 --> 00:43:53,309
Jr.?

833
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:55,816
Where are you?

834
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:58,016
Anne Hathaway Megan fox...

835
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:01,118
Found it...

836
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:04,121
Hey, wait. Wait!

837
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:08,311
I saw it coming inside.

838
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,401
I did see it coming inside.

839
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,396
There you are.

840
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:17,405
Sneaky.

841
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,825
Why don't you come to me?

842
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:23,817
I'm going to punish you.

843
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:26,617
Where did she go?

844
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:29,918
I wonder if they have caught the pervert.

845
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:33,107
I'm still scared,
that he might be in this room.

846
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,797
No way. He won't be back
unless he's a lunatic.

847
00:44:35,902 --> 00:44:37,589
Let's just get changed and rest.

848
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:39,391
Gee, I'm tired.

849
00:44:41,686 --> 00:44:42,386
What?

850
00:44:43,738 --> 00:44:46,125
Gosh, this is insane.

851
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:49,030
This is the perfect
situation to get the wrong idea.

852
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,769
-Have you guys found it yet?
-No, it's nowhere to be found.

853
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:03,516
-Where is Jungi, by the way?
-Right.

854
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:07,928
-Did he just take off?
-It's obvious! That punk.

855
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,425
-Guys, I'm back.
-What?

856
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:14,145
Why do you look so happy?

857
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:15,830
Well, you know...

858
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:19,645
Byungchul asked me to take
charge of his restaurant's kitchen.

859
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:20,222
What?

860
00:45:20,336 --> 00:45:23,079
-What are you talking about?
-I became a main chef.

861
00:45:23,174 --> 00:45:25,086
Finally, I get to have my own kitchen.

862
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,999
Really? Congratulation, Yuri.

863
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,483
But weren't you going
to break up with him?

864
00:45:29,578 --> 00:45:30,577
-Yes.
-What?

865
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:32,789
Well...

866
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:34,686
I was thinking,

867
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:40,016
it's not really a flaw to have
weird laugh, sneeze and hiccup.

868
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,333
-It's unique.
-Gosh.

869
00:45:42,428 --> 00:45:45,014
You were making a fuss about
breaking up with him this morning.

870
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:50,829
It's tiring.

871
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,156
I hope, I didn't train too hard.

872
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:56,547
I should do well for the test tomorrow.

873
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:02,841
-Are you alright?
-Move!

874
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,523
-What the heck...
-It's a pickpocket!

875
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,920
-Please help me catch that pickpocket!
-Sorry?

876
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:12,326
A pickpocket?

877
00:46:12,414 --> 00:46:13,420
That jerk...

878
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:16,101
You are so busted.

879
00:46:23,506 --> 00:46:27,406
"Guest house Waikiki"

880
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:34,705
All the perverts need to go to jail.

881
00:46:34,804 --> 00:46:38,937
What jail? We need to make sure that
they are no longer able to do men's duty.

882
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:42,256
Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

883
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:44,722
If I get caught,
I'm going to be in a big trouble.

884
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:48,604
Let's stop talking about pervert,
and go and buy some cup noodles.

885
00:46:50,212 --> 00:46:51,306
Shall we?

886
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,210
This is my chance!

887
00:46:55,117 --> 00:46:56,306
Let's go.

888
00:46:56,711 --> 00:46:58,918
I need to get out of here immediately!

889
00:47:07,788 --> 00:47:10,573
What? What now?

890
00:47:10,677 --> 00:47:14,189
We are going out to buy noodles and
how can you forget your wallet?

891
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,784
I'm sorry.

892
00:47:17,198 --> 00:47:18,895
Welcome, welcome.

893
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:21,594
What? What are you?

894
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:26,553
-Where's my wallet?
-Look around.

895
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,062
-Who are you?
-I'm the owner of the guest house!

896
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,835
Then, who are you?

897
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:34,041
You... You are the pervert!

898
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:37,657
Shush my ass! You are the pervert, right?

899
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:40,157
Stay still. We both are going to
die, if we get caught.

900
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:41,148
What?

901
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,950
Why would I?

902
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,765
You are the pervert,
and I was just looking for a snake.

903
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,565
You are looking for a snake?

904
00:47:48,368 --> 00:47:49,979
Do you think they will believe that?

905
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:52,377
If I get caught, I'm going to
tell them you are an accomplice.

906
00:47:52,457 --> 00:47:54,058
-What are you going to do?
-Accomplice?

907
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,368
What a thick-faced pervert.

908
00:47:57,479 --> 00:47:59,081
We will see about that later.

909
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:01,567
-You are a dead meat!
-Whatever.

910
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:03,601
I put it over here. Wait.

911
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:04,814
Found it!

912
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,609
-Shall we go?
-Get out, get out.

913
00:48:06,697 --> 00:48:10,798
Hey, I'm too lazy to go out now.
Let's just talk all night long.

914
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:12,409
Okay, fine.

915
00:48:13,092 --> 00:48:17,003
-Where shall we go, tomorrow?
-Where is the hot place in this area?

916
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:19,574
-We've been to that place, so...
-Gosh, this is getting crazier.

917
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:20,860
-...we should go...
-Darn it.

918
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:26,561
Gee, you scared me.

919
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:28,570
Hey, Kibong.

920
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,126
Why aren't you asleep?
You have a test tomorrow.

921
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:32,530
Well...

922
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:35,237
I'm too nervous to sleep.

923
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:36,726
Yuri,

924
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:38,736
do you think I can make it?

925
00:48:38,853 --> 00:48:40,750
What if I fail again?

926
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,162
Thinking about getting a test,

927
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:45,266
-makes me bit scared.
-Hey.

928
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,617
Man shouldn't be scared.

929
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:51,022
You worked so hard.

930
00:48:51,213 --> 00:48:54,815
I promised you,
you will make it to the first player.

931
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,616
Trust me.

932
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:58,665
Thanks.

933
00:48:59,754 --> 00:49:02,166
I heard that,
you haven't broken up with Byungchul,

934
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,347
and are going to be in charge of
Byungchul's restaurant's kitchen.

935
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,140
Yes?

936
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,355
-The thing is...
-It's okay.

937
00:49:09,443 --> 00:49:11,632
Congrats for being a chef!

938
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:13,131
Yes.

939
00:49:13,225 --> 00:49:15,526
-Thank you.
-I should be the one saying that!

940
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:18,026
Thanks to you, I could take
the test to be a first player.

941
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,414
So you know.

942
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:22,080
You better be nice to me.

943
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,976
Fine.

944
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:27,874
When I become a first player and
get good amount of salary,

945
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,094
-I will open a restaurant for you.
-Really?

946
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:33,371
-You promise?
-Of course!

947
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:36,386
Man like Kook Kibong doesn't
say two words with one mouth.

948
00:49:36,983 --> 00:49:40,775
It doesn't cost much for
fried chicken restaurant.

949
00:49:41,387 --> 00:49:43,484
Trust me.

950
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:45,285
Exchange of that,

951
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,777
will I get a free fried chicken?

952
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:48,793
Yes.

953
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:49,975
Thank you.

954
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:52,191
Anyway, Kook Kibong. You can do it!

955
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:54,207
You can do it, chef Cha!

956
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,400
Cheer up.

957
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,797
Thanks, Yuri.

958
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,161
It hurts...

959
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,322
What the heck are you looking at?

960
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:21,343
I'm hungry.

961
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:28,144
It's a chocolate bar!

962
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,102
Why?

963
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:30,102
You want some?

964
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,024
Would you like some?

965
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:33,905
Yes, please. I'm so hungry.

966
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:36,404
No way. I'm going to
eat it all by myself.

967
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:38,715
Hey.

968
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:39,729
Never mind.

969
00:50:39,824 --> 00:50:42,030
You are so cheap. I'm not eating it!

970
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:45,220
-Hey.
-Don't.

971
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:46,829
Hey.

972
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,122
-What? What do you want?
-Boy, he's sulky.

973
00:50:54,743 --> 00:50:55,535
Here.

974
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:02,402
You are so mean.

975
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:03,306
Thanks.

976
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:05,497
Hey.

977
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:06,997
Don't think that,

978
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:10,193
I will let you slide just
because you gave me this.

979
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:10,879
Got it?

980
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,568
-Okay, just eat up.
-Good that you know.

981
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:18,640
What?

982
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:21,252
Why is it so good? Where did you buy it?

983
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:23,901
This? You need to get out from
3rd exit of Itaewon station.

984
00:51:24,013 --> 00:51:26,330
Walk about 100m, and turn left.

985
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,325
You will see World Most Strict store.
I bought it there.

986
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:33,317
Also there's another store at 4th exit.

987
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,338
Hey, Kook Kibong! Good luck with the test.

988
00:51:35,442 --> 00:51:39,028
-If you fail, you are a dead meat.
-Okay, you jerk.

989
00:51:39,442 --> 00:51:42,045
-I will go now.
-Hey, Kibong!

990
00:51:42,339 --> 00:51:44,242
-Take this.
-What is that?

991
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:49,513
This is special energy drink,
that I made since early in the morning.

992
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:50,710
Catch it.

993
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:56,519
Hey.

994
00:51:56,621 --> 00:52:00,627
-And you call yourself a pitcher?
-It was a mistake.

995
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:06,729
-What's wrong?
-What?

996
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:09,237
It's nothing.

997
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:11,628
I will be back.

998
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:12,526
Good luck.

999
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,637
-Good luck.
-Hope you pass.

1000
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:14,732
Thanks, guys.

1001
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:19,447
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1002
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:25,604
I hope he passes.

1003
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,320
What the heck is Jungi doing,

1004
00:52:27,408 --> 00:52:29,853
all night long?

1005
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,249
Oh, my. It's already morning.

1006
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:36,550
You are right.

1007
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:40,610
Still, it was so nice to
chitchat with you all night long.

1008
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:41,599
Me too.

1009
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:44,495
-What music shall we listen to, now?
-Stop it, already.

1010
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:49,386
-Why are they so talkative?
-That's what I'm saying.

1011
00:52:49,473 --> 00:52:52,464
Did a talkative spirit
possess them or what?

1012
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:56,941
I know this tune!

1013
00:52:57,052 --> 00:53:00,049
It's obviously "A day" by Kim Bumsoo.

1014
00:53:00,153 --> 00:53:01,754
-Right?
-No, it's not.

1015
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,453
You know, it's...

1016
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:06,064
..."Don't worry,
my darling" by Jeon Ilkwon.

1017
00:53:06,256 --> 00:53:08,081
No, it's not. It's "A day" by Kim Bumsoo.

1018
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:10,161
No. It was sang by Jeon Ilkwon...

1019
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:12,659
Fine.

1020
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:13,970
Do you want to bet?

1021
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,065
Wrong one gets finger flick.
What do you say?

1022
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:16,574
Deal?

1023
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:18,469
-Deal.
-Right, I remember now!

1024
00:53:18,669 --> 00:53:20,669
It's "Don't worry,
my darling" by Jeon Ilkwon.

1025
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,047
Yes, you are right.

1026
00:53:22,152 --> 00:53:24,152
Yes! I told you so.

1027
00:53:24,255 --> 00:53:26,849
Come on, bring your head.

1028
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,652
Gee, it's so annoying.

1029
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,049
-Can you go easy on me?
-No way.

1030
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,837
I'm going to flick it hard.

1031
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:35,250
Come on, come on.

1032
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:46,522
What the heck?

1033
00:53:46,722 --> 00:53:48,317
-Why did you go easy on me?
-Hey,

1034
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,133
you gave me the chocolate bar earlier.

1035
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:53,030
Gosh, thanks.

1036
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,539
No problem.

1037
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:56,209
It's nothing.

1038
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,012
"No.55, Kook Kibong"

1039
00:54:07,217 --> 00:54:10,715
-That's the guy, that you considered.
-I see.

1040
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:20,853
What is this?

1041
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:21,838
Yes.

1042
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:22,937
Well...

1043
00:54:24,355 --> 00:54:25,951
I guess,

1044
00:54:26,038 --> 00:54:27,743
he's bit nervous.

1045
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,034
Kibong!

1046
00:54:30,144 --> 00:54:31,642
Where are your senses?

1047
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:34,126
Sorry, sir. I will try again.

1048
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:48,116
What?

1049
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:49,822
What's wrong?

1050
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:50,814
Sir...

1051
00:54:50,923 --> 00:54:52,133
I'm sorry.

1052
00:54:54,229 --> 00:54:56,053
Hey, what's wrong?

1053
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,234
What's up with your shoulder?

1054
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:58,648
Don't tell me,

1055
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,131
you got injured.

1056
00:55:00,942 --> 00:55:03,247
No, nothing happened.

1057
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,382
Are you sure, you alright?

1058
00:55:17,392 --> 00:55:18,580
I'm okay, sir.

1059
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,272
I'm perfectly fine.

1060
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:23,073
I will try again, sir.

1061
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,684
Okay.

1062
00:55:31,177 --> 00:55:34,032
You foolish boy! You are not fine at all.

1063
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,246
Get up, and let's go to the hospital!

1064
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:38,245
No, sir.

1065
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,931
I'm fine.

1066
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:42,934
I can do this. I really can do this, sir.

1067
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:44,844
I really can do this!

1068
00:55:57,172 --> 00:55:58,870
What's wrong? Are you ill?

1069
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:02,571
-No, it's okay. I'm fine.
-You are not fine.

1070
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,274
You are sweating.

1071
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,273
Actually,

1072
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,790
-I need to pee.
-What?

1073
00:56:12,878 --> 00:56:14,970
Don't worry about me.

1074
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:18,366
I can hold. I'm good at it.

1075
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,877
We have no choice.

1076
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,572
Hold it for awhile.

1077
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,263
-What are you going to do?
-I can't see you like this no more.

1078
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,745
-What?
-So just hold for awhile, okay?

1079
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:44,861
That scared me.

1080
00:56:44,957 --> 00:56:46,146
What was that?

1081
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:49,947
How weird.

1082
00:56:50,663 --> 00:56:52,414
-I bet, it's nothing.
-There you go.

1083
00:56:54,899 --> 00:56:56,026
Thanks, buddy.

1084
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,813
-Why did you do such dangerous work?
-You said, you need to go.

1085
00:56:59,908 --> 00:57:02,891
Gee, you are a foolish man.

1086
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:15,054
Pervert!

1087
00:57:19,563 --> 00:57:20,363
Why...

1088
00:57:20,658 --> 00:57:21,760
Why did you that?

1089
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:25,220
Why did you get bitten instead of me?

1090
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:27,227
You went...

1091
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,735
-...easy on me for finger flick.
-What?

1092
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,539
-That was the reason?
-You said, you are an actor.

1093
00:57:33,643 --> 00:57:35,047
Actor's face is important.

1094
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,729
It's not the time for you to
think about me, you idiot!

1095
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:41,074
And look at your lips.

1096
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,281
-You are making me upset.
-It's fine.

1097
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:46,480
I can get treated in jail.

1098
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:48,471
Thanks, buddy.

1099
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:50,895
Still,

1100
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:52,299
what you've done is something,

1101
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,077
you should never do.

1102
00:57:54,189 --> 00:57:56,189
And unforgivable.

1103
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:58,252
Get your punishment,

1104
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:00,546
and don't ever do it again.

1105
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:04,149
Can you promise?

1106
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:21,240
Officers, I think we are done. Let's go.

1107
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:25,844
I will visit you.

1108
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,440
Call me, when you get released.

1109
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:30,146
Got it?

1110
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:32,456
What are you doing?

1111
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:34,638
Have you become fond of
that pervert jerk?

1112
00:58:34,742 --> 00:58:35,439
What?

1113
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:36,818
Jerk?

1114
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:38,222
Hey.

1115
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,327
He...

1116
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,326
...was the most loyal friend that I know.

1117
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:43,684
What do you even know?

1118
00:58:49,678 --> 00:58:52,548
He's crazy. He's fully crazy.

1119
00:58:52,756 --> 00:58:54,652
Hey, Kibong. You are back!

1120
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:55,969
What happened to your test...

1121
00:58:56,455 --> 00:58:57,659
What's up with your arm?

1122
00:58:58,669 --> 00:58:59,970
-I just got a slight injury.
-What?

1123
00:59:00,073 --> 00:59:01,867
Injury? From where?

1124
00:59:02,073 --> 00:59:03,875
Then what about your test?

1125
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:05,555
I'm sorry,

1126
00:59:05,649 --> 00:59:07,768
but I would like to go and get some rest.

1127
00:59:33,117 --> 00:59:33,926
Hey,

1128
00:59:34,022 --> 00:59:36,934
what are you doing here?
You should get some rest.

1129
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:40,125
Coach wants to see me.

1130
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:41,437
I see.

1131
00:59:42,137 --> 00:59:42,747
Hey,

1132
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:46,858
I taught you about fork ball so hard.
Look at you now!

1133
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:51,787
I just wasted my time. Pathetic jerk.

1134
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,168
Kibong.

1135
00:59:55,072 --> 00:59:56,364
Yes, coach.

1136
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:13,368
Gosh, my back...

1137
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:16,773
My whole body is aching
because of cleaning all day.

1138
01:00:19,643 --> 01:00:22,340
I can't believe this is my kitchen now.

1139
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:25,539
I'm so happy.

1140
01:00:26,532 --> 01:00:29,080
-Yuri!
-Hey, Byungchul.

1141
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:32,390
Sorry for being late.
Training ended quite late.

1142
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:35,986
It's so clean, now.

1143
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,977
Did you clean by yourself?

1144
01:00:38,065 --> 01:00:39,063
Yes.

1145
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:42,770
What happened to Kibong?

1146
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:44,977
Has the result come out, yet?

1147
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:48,083
Haven't you heard, Yuri?

1148
01:00:48,576 --> 01:00:51,067
-Kibong got kicked out.
-Sorry?

1149
01:00:52,576 --> 01:00:55,554
-What do you mean, kicked out?
-The result came out.

1150
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:58,355
The previous injury has re-occurred.

1151
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:02,355
How can he call himself a pro,
when he can't even take care of his own.

1152
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:05,469
He dug his own grave. Stupid jerk.

1153
01:01:06,556 --> 01:01:09,642
No choice. It will take a
while to rehabilitate.

1154
01:01:09,754 --> 01:01:12,944
Even though he cures it, he can't be
assured that is fully cured. Of course,

1155
01:01:13,055 --> 01:01:15,139
the club will not wait for him.

1156
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:17,028
What a greedy jerk...

1157
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:20,011
How can a guy like him be a first player?
Stupid jerk.

1158
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:22,217
What did you just say?

1159
01:01:23,022 --> 01:01:25,142
-Sorry?
-Stupid jerk?

1160
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:27,522
What do you know?

1161
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,609
What do you know about him?

1162
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,408
Do you even know how hard he tried?

1163
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:35,528
Do you?

1164
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,702
Every single day, he always wakes up...

1165
01:01:38,805 --> 01:01:41,106
...at 5 am for training.

1166
01:01:41,202 --> 01:01:42,196
A boy like him,

1167
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:45,285
might not play baseball ever again.
And you say what?

1168
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:47,509
And you call yourself a senior?
You jerk.

1169
01:01:51,906 --> 01:01:54,582
Don't ever call me, got it?

1170
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:10,706
What do you mean, kicked out?

1171
01:02:10,801 --> 01:02:13,474
-What do you mean, sir?
-Sorry, kiddo.

1172
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,260
The club has decided,

1173
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:16,862
so I have no choice.

1174
01:02:18,173 --> 01:02:18,965
Coach,

1175
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:20,836
please give me one more chance.

1176
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:23,233
If I get rehabilitation,
I can pitch again.

1177
01:02:23,336 --> 01:02:25,129
I can really do well, coach.

1178
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:29,223
I'm begging you, sir. Please?

1179
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:30,519
Please?

1180
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:32,226
Sorry.

1181
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:34,115
I'm so sorry.

1182
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,128
What are you doing over here?

1183
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:00,930
Hey.

1184
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:02,525
I'm doing nothing.

1185
01:03:02,836 --> 01:03:03,636
I see.

1186
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:11,566
By the way,

1187
01:03:12,964 --> 01:03:14,670
-are you alright?
-What?

1188
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:16,859
About what?

1189
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,559
I heard your news.

1190
01:03:20,353 --> 01:03:21,058
You...

1191
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:25,709
-...got kicked out.
-Oh, that!

1192
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:29,107
So you've heard.

1193
01:03:30,115 --> 01:03:32,044
Well, too bad.

1194
01:03:32,259 --> 01:03:34,758
Rehabilitation will be
tiring and wasting time.

1195
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,449
It's better like this.

1196
01:03:37,053 --> 01:03:39,551
I was getting bored of baseball.

1197
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:41,662
It's time to quit.

1198
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,662
-Are you being serious?
-What?

1199
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:48,955
Of course!

1200
01:03:49,854 --> 01:03:51,758
I really am fine,

1201
01:03:51,854 --> 01:03:53,058
so don't worry about me.

1202
01:03:59,195 --> 01:04:00,487
Hey, Kook Kibong.

1203
01:04:02,385 --> 01:04:03,590
Look at me.

1204
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:05,507
Yes?

1205
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:06,333
Why?

1206
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:13,963
-Why did you do that for?
-If you want to cry, just cry.

1207
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:16,179
Don't hold back like a fool.

1208
01:04:33,638 --> 01:04:34,534
Yuri,

1209
01:04:36,551 --> 01:04:37,938
what am I going to do?

1210
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:42,815
I will be no longer able to play baseball.

1211
01:04:45,713 --> 01:04:47,824
I will be never able to play it.

1212
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,588
How am I going to live now?

1213
01:04:55,881 --> 01:04:58,282
What am I going to do?

1214
01:04:59,585 --> 01:05:03,282
What am I going to do now?

1215
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:32,360
"Welcome to Waikiki 2"

1216
01:05:33,154 --> 01:05:35,646
I will make Kibong cheer up, so trust me.

1217
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:38,249
-Trust me.
-How can he cheer up with this chocolate?

1218
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,751
-You think he's some kind of idiot?
-I want to eat.

1219
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:43,744
I really want to eat.
Where did you buy the chocolate?

1220
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,950
-Tell me the name!
-What kind of show are we doing?

1221
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,733
It's my boss's wife's birthday.

1222
01:05:48,813 --> 01:05:51,821
-Boss! The singer is here.
-Are you Wooshik?

1223
01:05:51,924 --> 01:05:53,010
Miyoung?

1224
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,908
If someone is looking for me, tell them,
I'm gone. No, I immigrated. Got it?

1225
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:57,711
You will be working with
anchor Jo Sanghwa, right?

1226
01:05:57,798 --> 01:05:59,321
I'm big fan of anchor Jo Sanghwa.

1227
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:01,313
Then, why don't you ask him out?

1228
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:03,768
-Do you want to go out with me tomorrow?
-Sorry?

1229
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:07,077
She better be careful. He will bring
her to his mansion to show her around.

1230
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:08,887
And he will play with her a bit,
and dump her.

1231
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,982
Gosh, seriously!
