1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:02,028
It's late. You should go home.

2
00:00:02,112 --> 00:00:03,047
Already?

3
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:06,022
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

4
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,930
Why drink coffee at this hour?

5
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:10,292
Why? It's not even nine yet.

6
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,587
Let's go.

7
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,927
I don't drink coffee.

8
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,118
"Kim Kwangseok, Fourth Album"

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,881
My head.

10
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:35,235
Where am I?

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,276
My room can't be this clean.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,909
And who's this?

13
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:49,583
You're so noisy.

14
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:51,775
Kibong.

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,308
Be quiet. I'm trying to sleep.

16
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,617
What the hell? Why are you in my bed?

17
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:08,705
I don't know either.

18
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,359
What the hell happened?

19
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,534
Wait. Let me think.

20
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,609
The business was good yesterday...

21
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,693
...so you and I had a drink
in my room to celebrate.

22
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,911
You're so cute.

23
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:24,403
Hey, quit it!

24
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,700
Did we...?

25
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,034
So...

26
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,247
...you and I...?

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,301
Yuri, I'm coming in.

28
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,165
Hey, hide!

29
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,684
Yuri, we have a major crisis.

30
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:49,510
What are you doing?

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,960
Do you know what time it is?

32
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,207
That was a good night of sleep.

33
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:55,818
Who is that?

34
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:56,736
What?

35
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,056
Oh, it's my friend.

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,012
Friend? Who?

37
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,691
Her name is Kisoon.

38
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:05,968
You don't know her.

39
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:06,886
Really?

40
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:09,969
When did she arrive?
I never saw her come in.

41
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:14,172
She came in late last night
when everyone was asleep.

42
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,774
Oh, I see.

43
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:19,096
She's really tall.

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,994
She's got huge feet too.

45
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,685
That's because...

46
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,601
...she's a former basketball player.

47
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:26,736
Wow, a former athlete?

48
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:28,262
But what brings you to my room?

49
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:30,694
Oh, yeah. There's a leak
in one of the guest room ceiling...

50
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:32,428
...and it's a total mess.

51
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,234
We're trying to find where the leak is.

52
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,458
We need to check here as well.

53
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:36,721
Now?

54
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:39,154
- Can't you do it later?
- No.

55
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:42,210
I already checked the other rooms.
Your room is the only one left.

56
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,337
The repairman is waiting
so get your butt out of bed.

57
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:45,744
Wake up your friend too.

58
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,345
Okay, okay.

59
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,455
Go wait outside. I'll change and go out.

60
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,849
Okay, be quick about it.

61
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:58,181
Yuri, what do we do now?

62
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,613
I don't know.

63
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:02,216
Put some clothes on first.

64
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:03,427
Put your clothes on.

65
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:09,236
Are you still not ready?
The repairman is waiting.

66
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,574
I heard you already. Hold on a minute!

67
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:13,135
Come on, hurry up!

68
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:14,850
What do we do now?

69
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:17,166
I don't know. Just hide somewhere. Hide!

70
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:18,175
Over there.

71
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,286
Are you done?

72
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:23,750
We're going in.

73
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,740
What's taking you so long?

74
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:29,975
Why is she still in bed?

75
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,894
She caught a bad cold
and can hardly move.

76
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:37,008
Really? Then what should we do?

77
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:39,137
We have to check the ceiling of this room.

78
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,669
Then just go ahead.
Just leave her alone to sleep.

79
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,278
But it's going to be noisy.

80
00:03:44,597 --> 00:03:46,757
I guess we don't have a choice.
Go ahead, sir.

81
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:47,959
Okay, I'll start over here.

82
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,863
Okay, I'll help you.

83
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,317
I'll put this here.

84
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,002
By the way, have you seen Kibong?

85
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,294
Kibong?

86
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,913
- Haven't seen him.
- Where did he go?

87
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:01,508
I didn't see him all night.

88
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:04,221
Didn't Kibong have
a drink with you last night?

89
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,566
Yeah, we were having a drink...

90
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,358
...but he only had a sip
and left right away.

91
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,783
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

92
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:11,167
Should I try calling him?

93
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:20,744
The number you have
dialed is not available...

94
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,352
His phone is turned off.

95
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,200
Where on earth is this guy?

96
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,716
Maybe he's at a friend's house.

97
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,814
Wooshik, I'll hold the ladder.
You go and do your thing.

98
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:31,606
Really? Why, thank you.

99
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:33,602
- Yuri!
- Gosh, what?

100
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,588
I have an audition tomorrow, so...

101
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:38,356
Who's this?

102
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,277
It's her friend, Kisoon.

103
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:41,472
Oh, I see.

104
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:42,823
But why is she sill in bed?

105
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,496
She's got a bad cold
so she can hardly move.

106
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,373
I'll leave it to you then.

107
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,291
Sure.

108
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,843
And why are you here, Jeongeun?

109
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:51,894
What is it?

110
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,836
I have an audition tomorrow.

111
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,976
Can I borrow your clothes?

112
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,101
Take whatever you want
from the hanger and get out.

113
00:04:58,185 --> 00:04:59,533
- Thanks, Yuri.
- Sure.

114
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,397
Did you find where the leak is?

115
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,746
No, the repairman's checking Yuri's room.

116
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:17,619
You're always at home these days.

117
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:18,856
Aren't you shooting "Honest Man"?

118
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,120
It already ended.

119
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,269
They told me I'd rise
to stardom with that show...

120
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,624
...but I'm not getting any offers
and I'm failing all the auditions.

121
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:26,733
I feel hopeless.

122
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:34,367
Yes, sir? What?

123
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,143
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

124
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:39,527
What is it?

125
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:40,526
It's a director I know.

126
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,041
He wants me to come now to fill a role.

127
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,285
I'll be back.

128
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,258
Shall I go and finish arranging my song?

129
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:49,254
Wooshik!

130
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,299
Suyeon?

131
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,537
Didn't you go to the shoot today?

132
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:55,236
No, it's my day off.

133
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,090
Wooshik...

134
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:00,801
...it's for you.

135
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:01,829
What's this?

136
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:02,809
Go on and open it.

137
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:04,891
All right.

138
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,299
"Kim Kwangseok, Fourth Album"

139
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:14,788
- How did you get this?
- I got my first pay.

140
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,409
So I got this for you as a gift.

141
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,632
You were really upset when it broke.

142
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:21,821
Thanks. It must have been
hard to find and expensive.

143
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,271
No, it was pretty easy to find.

144
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,400
Thank you so much.
I'll enjoy listening to this.

145
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,323
Sure.

146
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,676
By the way, who's the girl
you were with last night?

147
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:33,594
Who?

148
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,998
Oh, Minah?

149
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:39,282
She's a kid I used to train.

150
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:41,150
She's making her debut soon.

151
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:43,378
And she'll use the song that I composed.

152
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,442
What? You're not the one singing it?

153
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:48,386
It just turned out that way.

154
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:52,897
So I'll be busy from now on
producing for the kid.

155
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,565
I'm going upstairs to get some work done.

156
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:57,843
- All right.
- Thanks.

157
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:03,030
Hello? Hey Minah, what's up?

158
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,316
What? A date?

159
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:09,073
You can't ask me out. I'm your teacher.

160
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:13,758
All right. Come by if you have
anything to ask.

161
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,482
Yuri. Which one looks better?

162
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,547
- They're both pretty.
- Really?

163
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:23,492
But this one looks too sexy.

164
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,152
Then just wear the other one.

165
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,492
But I like this design better.

166
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:28,460
Then wear that one.

167
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:30,717
Come on, can't you help me choose?

168
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,688
Gosh.

169
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,578
Just take them both and get out.

170
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:38,753
What is it now?

171
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,088
Excuse me for a moment, sir.

172
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:50,385
Hello? What?

173
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,095
Really?

174
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:55,024
Okay.

175
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:57,500
What's the matter?

176
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:00,347
There's smoke coming
out of our food truck.

177
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:04,100
We left it at the park yesterday
because Kibong had a drink.

178
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,078
- What do I do?
- Hurry up and go.

179
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:09,368
Gosh. I can't leave now.

180
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,059
Why is this happening?

181
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,033
Hey, Kisoon.

182
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,656
I'll be right back.

183
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,275
Just stay in bed and don't move, okay?

184
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,790
Jeongeun, could you hold the ladder?

185
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,749
Sure.

186
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,378
If you let this go, it'll be a disaster.

187
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:29,706
Be careful.

188
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,623
Okay.

189
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,287
"Filming in Progress,
'Behind the Very White Tower'"

190
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,464
Sir, I'm here.

191
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:47,562
Hey, you're here.

192
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,439
Sorry for calling you
in such short notice.

193
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:51,407
One of the actors canceled on us.

194
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,807
It's okay.

195
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,573
I should thank you for calling me.

196
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,607
But, what is the role?

197
00:08:56,691 --> 00:09:00,011
Well, the protagonist is a doctor.

198
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:03,025
And your role is the husband
of a woman he killed by mistake.

199
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,543
He seeks revenge on the protagonist.

200
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,885
Oh, revenge!

201
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,217
- Take a look at the script first.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:10,570
- Here.
- Thank you.

203
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,286
All this time I had to wear mascot suits.

204
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,291
Now, I finally get to do some real acting.

205
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,331
Hello.

206
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,451
- Hello.
- Hey.

207
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,639
Jungi!

208
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:22,738
Hyunseong?

209
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:27,263
Oh, that's right. You're the male lead.

210
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,915
Yes. But what brings you here?

211
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,832
What?

212
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,959
I was asked to fill in for the role.

213
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:36,856
So you got the part? That's great.

214
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,526
You two know each other?

215
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,289
Yes, he was my senior at college.

216
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:41,367
What have you been up to?

217
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,483
I did see you in a children's show.

218
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:45,805
What?

219
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,338
Well, you know... This and that.

220
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,250
Shall we try rehearsing?

221
00:09:58,977 --> 00:09:59,918
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,302
Okay... Action!

223
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,650
Kang Joonsang. This is all your fault.

224
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,673
You killed her.

225
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:13,246
You killed my Youngsook!

226
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:15,893
You just wait.

227
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:19,941
I will destroy you.

228
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,796
I will destroy you!

229
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:29,627
Look at you go, Jungi. Nice!

230
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:31,194
Thank you.

231
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:32,787
Then let's begin shooting.

232
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:33,754
Yes, sir.

233
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:35,400
Sir, we're in trouble.

234
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:36,693
Why? What's wrong?

235
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,500
We missed a product placement.

236
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,934
We should have put it
in the last episode, but I forgot.

237
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:44,019
Today is the last day of shooting.
Why are you telling me this now?

238
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,996
This is not good.

239
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,442
Which product is it?

240
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:49,140
This one. The vegetable chopper.

241
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:50,223
Vegetable chopper...?

242
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:53,772
We're shooting scenes where the husband
takes revenge on the protagonist.

243
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,207
How can we put that in?

244
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,169
It's breach of contract
if we don't put it in.

245
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,918
- What do we do?
- Breach of contract?

246
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:02,464
Jeez, what do I do?

247
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:08,928
What?

248
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,188
Ready.

249
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:14,809
Action!

250
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,570
Kang Joonsang. This is all your fault.

251
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:24,411
You killed her.

252
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,195
You killed my Youngsook!

253
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:29,953
You just wait.

254
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,901
I will destroy you.

255
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,797
I will destroy you!

256
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,902
I only chopped five times.

257
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:45,926
But the picture's been cut evenly
just the way I wanted.

258
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:49,540
It works well on papers so it'll be
perfect for cutting vegetables.

259
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,130
Cut! Okay!

260
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,169
Let's take a tight shot of the mincing.

261
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,335
Excuse me, sir?

262
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,423
Yeah?

263
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:07,701
Do you think it will be okay, though?

264
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,619
Using a chopper to cut
the photo just doesn't feel right.

265
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:11,801
Why?

266
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:16,077
It means he's furious enough to mince
the photo instead of ripping it.

267
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,899
You're right, but...

268
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:20,883
Still, it's a bit...

269
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:22,057
You don't want to do it?

270
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:24,354
Then don't. I guess you don't
want to work with me again.

271
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,999
No, sir. I'll do it. I can do it.

272
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:29,586
Sure.

273
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,961
I can hear the water.

274
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:39,002
I think it's here somewhere.

275
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,440
- Really?
- Yes.

276
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:43,611
First, I need to drill a hole
and check with a camera.

277
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,139
- Would that be okay?
- There's no other way. Go ahead.

278
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,319
Let's see. Where should I drill?

279
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:53,360
Oh, no! Miss, are you alright?

280
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,302
Is she hurt?
Miss, you should check on her.

281
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:57,219
Okay.

282
00:12:57,806 --> 00:12:59,892
Kisoon, are you okay?

283
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:01,812
Why isn't she answering?

284
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:03,682
Kisoon, are you okay?

285
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:06,749
I'm fine.

286
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,114
What's wrong with your voice?

287
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,920
It's because of the bad cold.

288
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,699
I'm sorry for hurting you
when you're sick.

289
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,753
It's okay.

290
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:19,958
I'll have to start over.

291
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:26,878
What? Why won't it drill?

292
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,401
The ceiling must be really solid.

293
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:36,905
Miss! I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

294
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:42,181
Yes. I'm fine.

295
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:43,539
You should have been careful!

296
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,913
Are you okay, Kisoon?
Let me take a look.

297
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,649
I'm fine.

298
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,027
I'm fine. Really.

299
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:53,414
She can't be fine.

300
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,778
I said I'm fine.

301
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:59,727
Stop it!

302
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:03,960
This is the scene...

303
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:08,642
...where the husband goes
to the doctor's house for revenge.

304
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,396
Make sure you show the rage.

305
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,701
Yes, sir.

306
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,202
Sir, we have a problem.

307
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,043
What now? What is it?

308
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:17,557
Miseon can't do
the product placement scene.

309
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:19,694
- Oh, my.
- She endorses...

310
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,311
a rival brand,
and it'd violate her contract.

311
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,043
Then ask another actor.

312
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,204
They all refused.

313
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,908
What is the product?

314
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,455
This. An LED mask.

315
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,386
- Wow, it's big.
- LED mask?

316
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:34,253
Who can put this on?

317
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:39,506
What?

318
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,238
Ready!

319
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,467
Action!

320
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,925
Kang Joonsang, wake up!

321
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,518
I said, wake up!

322
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,959
What? What's going on?

323
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:09,133
- Who are you?
- What is it, honey?

324
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,050
Goodness!

325
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,284
Who are you? Tell me!

326
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:13,219
Do you remember...

327
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,558
...a woman named Kim Youngsook?

328
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:17,740
King Youngsook? You mean...

329
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:20,292
...the patient with arrhythmia?

330
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:23,444
That's right. Because you decided
to operate on a chairman...

331
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,547
...her surgery was delayed
and she died helplessly.

332
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:28,129
I am...

333
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,905
...her husband.

334
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:32,843
My Youngsook is...

335
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:36,658
...now underneath cold dirt
where she can't see the sun.

336
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,640
While your wife basks her face
in this LED mask...

337
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,848
...that brightens the skin tone,
reduces wrinkles and firms up the skin!

338
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:48,686
No wonder her skin is
like that of a newborn baby.

339
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:49,849
What is it that you want?

340
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:52,613
Your life.

341
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,070
Die!

342
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:01,511
Cut! Okay!

343
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,361
You were great.

344
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,401
Thank you.

345
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:08,661
Sir?

346
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,274
- Would it be okay?
- What?

347
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:15,133
A man who seeks revenge
wearing an LED mask is a bit...

348
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:16,280
Why?

349
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:20,956
The LED mask made your eyes glow red,
making you look totally vicious.

350
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,083
Come on. Now, let's change the angle...

351
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,068
...and go again.

352
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:25,986
Okay.

353
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,642
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

354
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:33,626
Is this a drama or a commercial?

355
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:40,555
Wooshik.

356
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,389
I'm going to the groceries.
Do you want to come?

357
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:43,766
Get some hotteok on our way home.

358
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,107
Oh, sorry. I have to go out soon.

359
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:49,801
Minah will be in the neighborhood.
We're going to eat together.

360
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,344
I see.

361
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,206
Too bad. I'll see you later.

362
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,849
- Out of the way!
- Yikes!

363
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:01,188
What was that?
Something just passed by me.

364
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:02,418
I think it was Yuri.

365
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:03,915
What's the matter with her?

366
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:07,172
Jeongeun.

367
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:09,305
Oh, you're back. How is your food truck?

368
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:11,918
It was just a small fire
but we put it out.

369
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,867
I'll hold the ladder now.
You can go.

370
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:15,940
Okay.

371
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,747
- Thanks for the dress.
- Sure.

372
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,494
Kibong.

373
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:26,772
Kisoon?

374
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:28,300
Are you okay?

375
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:32,501
You're bleeding.

376
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:36,962
Hey. What happened to your face?

377
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,706
There was a little accident.

378
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,987
What do we do now?

379
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,225
Let's sneak out now.

380
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:48,422
Get up.

381
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:50,607
Yuri!

382
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,110
Yuri!

383
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:54,407
Yes? What?

384
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,623
Why are you so startled?

385
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,709
I wasn't startled. Why?

386
00:17:57,793 --> 00:18:00,189
I'm just checking
if we've found the leak.

387
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:02,296
I'm not sure either.

388
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,215
Have we?

389
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,897
It's here.

390
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,517
I found the leak.

391
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:11,523
So what needs to be done?

392
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,515
I'll just remove a small part
of the ceiling and fix it.

393
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,119
About 3 tor 4 hours should be enough.

394
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:16,950
Then, why not start right away?

395
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,923
But something might fall
from the ceiling during the repair.

396
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:22,364
This young lady should get up now.

397
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,569
Oh, I see.

398
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:26,677
Let's wake your friend up
and take her to another room.

399
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,632
What? Um...

400
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,595
But Kisoon is sweating all over.

401
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,858
She should get changed first.
Can you step out for a minute?

402
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,030
Okay.

403
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:39,026
- Let's step out for a moment.
- Sure.

404
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,211
Yuri. What should we do now?

405
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,446
I don't know.

406
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,832
What do we do? What do we do now?

407
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:55,212
Oh, dear.

408
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,675
Okay, we have one last scene left.
Let's finish it at one go.

409
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,802
- Yes!
- Yes!

410
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:04,896
Ready.

411
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,730
Wait! Sir.

412
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:09,269
What now? What is it this time?

413
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:12,051
The president just called.
We need to shoot more products.

414
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:13,570
What?

415
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:15,364
More product placements?

416
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:17,767
We only have one scene left, and what?

417
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:19,923
Tell him we can't!

418
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:23,092
He said he won't be seeing
you again if you say no.

419
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:24,009
What?

420
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,634
For goodness' sake!

421
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:38,229
Ready.

422
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,899
Action!

423
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:56,495
This is lots of fun!

424
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:59,868
The automatic balancing
makes it so comfortable to ride.

425
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,839
What a pity.

426
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:05,097
You won't be able to have fun
riding this ever again.

427
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:07,278
What are you going to do to us?

428
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,743
Sir, please don't kill us. Please!

429
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:10,660
Shut up!

430
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:17,869
Shut your mouth.

431
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:19,869
I said shut it!

432
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,850
At last, it's quiet.

433
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:27,380
I thought this thing makes
your face firm and elastic.

434
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:29,360
I didn't know it could be used like this.

435
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:34,734
Do you want to live?

436
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,614
Then shake it harder.

437
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,374
Until your cheeks are gone!

438
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:42,788
Show me how much
you want to live! Come on!

439
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,902
But why did you ignore my wife
when she begged you to save her?

440
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,327
I'm asking why you ignored her!

441
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:01,396
You don't have anything to say?

442
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,726
Then shall we end this now?

443
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:09,154
We need music in a moment like this.

444
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:10,903
Sinbad.

445
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,371
Yes, master.

446
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,371
Play a music you would
listen to before you die.

447
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:19,477
Okay. I'll play a music that you
would listen to before you die.

448
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,851
What a smart cookie.

449
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:31,938
It understood exactly what I said
and chose the perfect song.

450
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,814
How is it? Is it nice?

451
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,204
Do you think the music is nice?!

452
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:48,774
It's time now.

453
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:53,979
Goodbye.

454
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,985
Oops, wait a second.

455
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,656
I forgot to get rid of the evidence.

456
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:03,289
My DNA could be found
from my hair on the floor.

457
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:04,875
Hold on.

458
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,664
Cleaning start.

459
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:20,329
The powerful suction of this vacuum
will remove all my hair...

460
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:23,038
...as well as the fine dust scattered
all over the apartment.

461
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,006
Perfect.

462
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,859
Now, it's time to end this.

463
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:42,259
Goodbye.

464
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:46,680
Cut!

465
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:49,295
Okay.

466
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,084
- Good job, everyone.
- Thank you.

467
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,586
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

468
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,883
Nice work, Jungi.

469
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:56,544
You too. Good job.

470
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,778
It's been a while since I saw you.
Would you like to grab a drink?

471
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:00,695
A drink?

472
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,673
I'm a little tired today.

473
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:05,236
Maybe next time.

474
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:06,477
All right.

475
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:08,988
I'll go now.

476
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:19,908
Why are you taking so long?

477
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:21,483
The repairman is busy. Hurry up!

478
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,020
All right.

479
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,827
Whoa, you're really tall.

480
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:31,538
I'm sorry for doing this
when you're not feeling well.

481
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,372
Please rest in another room.

482
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:35,694
No. Kisoon is going home now.

483
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:37,881
She is? Can you take
her home by yourself?

484
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,101
- Should I give you a ride?
- No. I can take her myself.

485
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,275
I'm going out for an appointment.
Let me give you a ride.

486
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,637
I said no!

487
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,908
Just do your thing.

488
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:48,399
Fine. I'm just trying to help.
Why are you all angry?

489
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,373
Because...

490
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,459
...Kisoon is very shy of strangers.

491
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:54,900
Oh, really?

492
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,269
Take care, Kisoon.

493
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:02,087
Let's go, Kisoon.

494
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:07,120
Go ahead.

495
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:13,927
- Are you okay?
- She's okay.

496
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,304
You can go. Just go on your way.

497
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,954
Kisoon, are you all right?

498
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:20,850
Get up. Come on, get up.

499
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:24,363
You're okay, right?

500
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:25,802
Wait.

501
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:32,163
What is it, brother?

502
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:43,248
Here, she dropped her sunglasses and hat.

503
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,936
Oh, those? It's fine.

504
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:48,990
Just leave them there.

505
00:24:49,074 --> 00:24:51,623
What are you talking about?
These are her stuffs.

506
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:53,736
It's fine, really.

507
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:54,927
What do we do?

508
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:55,969
Kibong.

509
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,098
Run!

510
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,014
- Oh, jeez.
- Hey, ladies!

511
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:03,150
You should take this.

512
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:05,653
She doesn't need the hat.
She doesn't need it.

513
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:07,781
She doesn't need it.

514
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:10,703
What? What? Why?

515
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:12,890
Why did she do that?

516
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:17,576
I told you she is very shy of strangers.

517
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,718
How shy could she be to jump
off from the second floor?

518
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:22,422
What if she's hurt?

519
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:23,774
She'll be okay.

520
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:26,396
She's very athletic.

521
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,494
Ouch, my leg.

522
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,159
Jeez. How can I look Yuri
in the face from now on?

523
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:47,534
I should just spend the night
at a sauna and go back tomorrow.

524
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,912
I need to get out of this neighborhood
before the guys see me.

525
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:53,496
I need to hurry.

526
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,122
Ouch, my leg.

527
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:59,820
That scared the hell out of me.
Wooshik almost found out.

528
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:02,752
Is Kibong going to be okay?

529
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:04,542
I guess he got away.

530
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,184
But how could I do such a thing?

531
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,313
How am I supposed to look
at Kibong in the face?

532
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:13,172
I'm going to lose it!

533
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:19,051
Oh, man.

534
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:21,822
I thought I'd be doing some real acting.

535
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:24,283
But what is this?

536
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,220
I'm thankful that they gave
this to me as a gift...

537
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,215
...but what would I use this for?

538
00:26:30,926 --> 00:26:34,103
I guess I can give this to Jeongeun.

539
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:39,570
Ouch, my knee.

540
00:26:39,828 --> 00:26:42,375
My knee! Did I get hit by a car?

541
00:26:44,408 --> 00:26:48,040
Miss, you should watch where you're going.

542
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:53,312
Miss, are you okay?

543
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,982
This is driving me nuts!
What should I do?

544
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:59,290
Miss, can you get up?

545
00:27:00,507 --> 00:27:01,340
Miss?

546
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,515
Wait, Miss? Where are you going?

547
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,991
Miss, Miss. Miss, Miss!

548
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:09,957
That's my mask. This one is yours!

549
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:11,704
Our masks got switched!

550
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,091
How could a woman run so fast?

551
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:18,694
Why take my LED mask?

552
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,296
This one's for Yuri.

553
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:24,020
- Thank you.
- One for each of you.

554
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:26,204
Thanks.

555
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:29,623
Why did you get face masks
all of a sudden?

556
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:33,931
My first paycheck came out a few days ago,
so I bought them as gifts.

557
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:35,002
Although it's nothing much.

558
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,537
No, this is great.

559
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:41,126
It's so cute. Thank you for the gift.

560
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:44,200
Don't mention it. I owe you guys so much.

561
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:48,104
This smells great
and it's totally my type.

562
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,843
Thanks, Suyeon. I'll use it well.

563
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:53,852
Darn it. If it wasn't
for that giant lady...

564
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,449
...I could've given you an LED mask.

565
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:57,589
What are you talking about?

566
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,529
I got an LED mask from the shoot.

567
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,015
But some giant lady stole it
when I was on my way home.

568
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:04,957
She'd better hope I don't catch her.

569
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,898
I have evidence.

570
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,254
By the way, where is Kibong?

571
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,173
He hasn't come home yet.

572
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,078
He has a business to run.
Where has he gone off to?

573
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,395
Yuri, did Kibong call you?

574
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,316
Yuri.

575
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:22,820
Huh, what? Why?

576
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,661
Did Kibong call you?

577
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:28,255
Why are you asking me? I don't know!

578
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:30,918
Then just say you don't know.
Why are you getting angry?

579
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:33,609
Yuri, did you...

580
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:35,951
...fight with Kibong again?

581
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:37,863
That's why he's not coming home, right?

582
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:39,281
No, I didn't.

583
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,914
Hey, Kibong. Where have you been?

584
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,731
What? I was at a friend's house.

585
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:50,483
Then you should have called.
You had me worried.

586
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:54,221
Sorry. I'm feeling tired,
so I'll go get some sleep.

587
00:28:57,832 --> 00:29:00,401
Me too. I'm going to my room.

588
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:04,451
What's up with those two?

589
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:09,014
I'm pretty sure they had another fight.

590
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:18,258
It's so awkward.

591
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,675
I can't even look at Yuri's face.

592
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,430
We have to open the food truck later.
What am I going to do?

593
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,830
How could I make such a stupid mistake?

594
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,338
But... was it really a mistake?

595
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:37,609
Is it possible that I have
feelings for her?

596
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,646
I must've been crazy.

597
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,167
How could I sleep with Kibong?

598
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,606
Why? Why did I do that?

599
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:51,798
It is true that Yuri is cool and pretty.

600
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,444
She even cheered me up
when I got released from my team.

601
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:55,858
She is a nice person.

602
00:29:55,943 --> 00:30:00,370
Well, Kibong is a nice guy.
And he's cute too.

603
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:05,070
Not only that, he used his last salary
to buy that food truck for me.

604
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:11,365
Still, I've never thought
of Kibong as a man.

605
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,509
Still, I've never thought
of Yuri as a woman.

606
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:16,528
Then...

607
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:19,731
...does Yuri like me?

608
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:23,601
Then... does Kibong like me?

609
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,330
If that's true, then what?

610
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:29,413
This is so awkward.

611
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:38,813
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

612
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,799
This is nice.

613
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,448
I knew this would happen
when those two squabblers...

614
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:49,681
...became business partners.

615
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,272
Why did they fight this time?

616
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:53,586
I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.

617
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,732
They probably fought over nothing.

618
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:56,837
Don't mind them.

619
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:02,870
Hello?

620
00:31:03,984 --> 00:31:05,041
Yes, this is he.

621
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:11,935
Oh, hey. Why are you calling me?

622
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,606
Jungi. Are you free
for an audition today?

623
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:16,665
An audition?

624
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,559
What audition?

625
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,890
There's a vacant role for a movie
that I'll be shooting soon.

626
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:25,083
I recommended you and
the director wants to see you today.

627
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:29,220
Really? Sure, I'd love to.

628
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:32,190
Okay. I'll get ready
and head over right away.

629
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:33,245
Okay.

630
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,859
What is it? Are you going to an audition?

631
00:31:35,944 --> 00:31:37,150
Who recommended you?

632
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:40,467
What? It's Hyunseong.

633
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:41,991
Hyunseong?

634
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:44,505
You mean, Kim Hyunseong from college?

635
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,501
Yes. I ran into him
at a shoot yesterday.

636
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:51,985
Jungi, are you really going
to an audition that he introduced...

637
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,058
...when he screwed you over in the past?

638
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,047
It's all in the past.

639
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:57,503
I'll see you later.

640
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:03,007
Why? What is it?

641
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,783
What do you mean, he screwed Jungi over?

642
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:05,903
Well...

643
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,132
...do you know the actor, Kim Hyunseong?

644
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,294
Yes, I do.

645
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:10,898
He's very popular these days.

646
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:12,959
Was he your junior in college?

647
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:13,877
Yeah.

648
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:18,940
Jungi was casted as the male
lead for a movie a long time ago...

649
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:22,225
...but Hyunseong stole the role
using his connections.

650
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:23,892
It was the movie "Nineteen."

651
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:25,028
"Nineteen"?

652
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,412
That movie was a huge hit.

653
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:29,958
So Jungi was supposed to be the male lead?

654
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,342
Yes, that's right.

655
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:34,292
I can't believe he's not even angry.

656
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:36,521
That idiot.

657
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,103
A country.

658
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:44,558
What does a country mean to you?

659
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,137
I know.

660
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:48,652
I know it very well.

661
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,710
Article 1(2) of the Constitution.

662
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:54,295
"Sovereignty resides in the people
and authority is granted by the people"!

663
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,928
The people are the country!

664
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:57,808
But the "country" that you defined...

665
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:00,973
...are the soldiers who
took over the government.

666
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,909
They're not the country!

667
00:33:05,162 --> 00:33:06,589
Tell me the truth.

668
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,928
Is this real patriotism?

669
00:33:12,443 --> 00:33:14,055
That would be all.

670
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,921
I like it. No wonder
Hyunseong recommended you.

671
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:20,064
- Thank you.
- All right.

672
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,214
I look forward to working with you.

673
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:23,196
Pardon?

674
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:28,351
Are you saying that you want to cast me?

675
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:30,032
For such a huge role?

676
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:32,198
Why? You don't want it?

677
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:36,533
No, sir. I'd love to do it.

678
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:39,622
Thank you. I'll do my best!

679
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:43,255
Thank you. Thank you so much.

680
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:45,028
Thank you so much.

681
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,414
Hello, I'm Han Suyeon
of Report Special Force.

682
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:55,745
Today, I'm here at Yangyang
to see a very special cat.

683
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:57,974
I'm here at Yangyang...

684
00:33:58,548 --> 00:33:59,641
Do you need any help?

685
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:00,630
It's okay.

686
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:03,067
You look busy preparing for the shoot.
Keep practicing.

687
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:05,284
What are you shooting tomorrow?

688
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:08,307
There's a talking cat
in Yangyang, Gangwon-do.

689
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,011
A talking cat?

690
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:12,789
Yes. When it wakes up in the morning,
it stands in front of the door...

691
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:14,857
...and cries, "Let meow, let meow."

692
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,725
Really? Then when it wants to come in...

693
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,956
...does it cry "Let meow in, let meow in"?

694
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:20,855
Yeah. Apparently, it does.

695
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,692
- Really?
- And when it's hungry...

696
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:26,085
...it cries, "Meow hungry, meow hungry."

697
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,407
Wow, is it really a cat or a person?

698
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:31,554
Wooshik!

699
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,973
What brings you here?

700
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,441
Wooshik, who's she?

701
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,098
She's a student I used to train.

702
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:42,108
Hello. I'm Choi Minah.

703
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:43,708
Hello.

704
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,888
What are you doing here?

705
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:48,516
I have some questions
about the song you wrote.

706
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:49,531
You do?

707
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,034
Then let's go up to my studio.

708
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:56,816
The studio is too stuffy.

709
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:59,472
The weather's really nice.
Let's go out and talk.

710
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:00,623
I'll treat you to ice cream.

711
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:03,395
What? Ice cream's for kids.

712
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,431
I want some. Let's go.

713
00:35:05,515 --> 00:35:06,805
Hey, let this go.

714
00:35:07,176 --> 00:35:08,009
Come on!

715
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:10,675
Oh, man.

716
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,345
Have fun!

717
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:16,513
Suyeon, doesn't it look like
she's into Wooshik?

718
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,448
Pardon?

719
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,869
I'm not sure.

720
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:21,794
I'm 100 percent certain.

721
00:35:21,975 --> 00:35:23,888
I get gut feelings
about these kind of things.

722
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,895
What's up Jungi?

723
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,959
What? You got the part? Really?

724
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,352
Yes.

725
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,289
I did.

726
00:35:36,374 --> 00:35:38,069
I'll be playing the counterpart
of the protagonist.

727
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:41,072
It's a big role and
the character is great too.

728
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,937
This isn't a dream, right?

729
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:46,118
Then try pinching yourself or something.

730
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:48,337
Pinch myself? Okay, wait.

731
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:51,358
What the heck?

732
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:54,957
It hurts! It hurts so much!

733
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,939
I don't think it's a dream.

734
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,346
Are you that happy?

735
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:01,323
Yes, I'm happy. So happy.
The happiest in the world.

736
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,440
Hey, I'll be home soon.

737
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:05,196
Let's go get a drink to celebrate.

738
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:08,667
All right, then. Bye.

739
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,592
- Sir.
- Yeah?

740
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,110
Are you sure about casting Jungi?

741
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,770
What else can we do?

742
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:22,047
But it's a big role for
someone who lacks experience.

743
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:24,162
I'm concerned about that, too.

744
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:27,567
But Hyunseong said he won't do it
unless we cast Jungi.

745
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,358
He might reject his part
if we get on his nerves.

746
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,522
Those who uses connections
are such a nuisance.

747
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,202
It's so messed up.

748
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:46,288
So...

749
00:36:47,016 --> 00:36:48,482
...shall we open for business?

750
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:50,720
All right.

751
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,608
Wait, Yuri.

752
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,638
Huh? Why?

753
00:36:58,295 --> 00:37:00,425
About what happened a few days ago...

754
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:05,888
...it was a mistake, right?

755
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:07,932
What? A mistake?

756
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:09,512
It was a mistake?

757
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:11,559
He didn't have feelings for me?

758
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:15,816
Whatever. It's better off this way.

759
00:37:16,082 --> 00:37:19,064
Yes. Of course it was a mistake.

760
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,222
It was just the alcohol.

761
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,635
Let's just pretend it never happened.

762
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:26,811
Pretend it never happened?

763
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,363
Then she didn't have feelings for me?

764
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,274
Whatever. It's better that way.

765
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,425
Sure. Let's pretend it never happened.

766
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:36,259
Fine! Let's do that!

767
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:38,016
Shall we prepare for the opening?

768
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:39,255
Fine!

769
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:59,028
What? It was a mistake?

770
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,913
Is that all you can say?

771
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:05,865
There's not even an ounce
of responsibility in that guy.

772
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:10,789
What? It never happened?

773
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,209
She's going to forget the whole thing?

774
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,427
Everything's so easy for her.

775
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:19,464
What's this?

776
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,041
Hey, Kook Kibong.

777
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:22,720
You did this, didn't you?

778
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:23,739
Did what?

779
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:25,993
There's pepper in the salt container.

780
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:28,579
Really? Sorry.
I guess I made a mistake.

781
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:29,496
What?

782
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,933
A mistake? It was a mistake?

783
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:36,452
Why is everything a mistake for you?

784
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:38,350
This was the first time.

785
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,930
Besides, the kitchen is
your responsibility.

786
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,958
Dividing the responsibility
of kitchen and serving...

787
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,057
...was when business was low.

788
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,692
Then let's pretend it didn't happen.

789
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,986
What? Pretend it didn't happen?

790
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,495
You want to pretend it didn't happen?

791
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,836
Do you really think it
would solve the problem...

792
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:55,343
...if you pretend it never happened?

793
00:38:55,428 --> 00:38:56,261
What?

794
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,203
Why are you trying to argue with me?

795
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:01,873
Forget it. Let's just drop it.

796
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,028
Fine by me.

797
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:10,716
Shouldn't we have a party
since Jungi passed the audition?

798
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,150
Of course, we should.

799
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:15,058
Jungi is going to be a star for real.

800
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:17,094
He worked so hard all this time.

801
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:19,123
I guess things are starting
to work out for him.

802
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:20,694
I'm back.

803
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:25,344
How was the date?

804
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:27,983
What date? We just had a cup of tea.

805
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:29,708
And I told you, she's just my student.

806
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:32,314
She seemed more than just your student.

807
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,945
From what I've seen, she likes you.

808
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,277
I'm sure.

809
00:39:37,362 --> 00:39:39,512
Quiet! Enough of your nonsense.

810
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:48,175
Wooshik! I'm home now.

811
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,112
It was really nice seeing you.
I'll see you again soon.

812
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:52,957
What is it? Is it Minah?

813
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:56,654
Yeah. She's just letting me know
that she reached home.

814
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:58,563
What's this?

815
00:39:59,138 --> 00:39:59,971
What is this?

816
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:01,727
What is it? Let me see.

817
00:40:01,812 --> 00:40:02,954
"W, S, L, I, W, W, S, O, G"

818
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,569
Why did she only write
the initial consonants?

819
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,571
What does it mean?

820
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:08,384
Could it be...?

821
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,374
What?

822
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:13,261
Kids these days use
the initial consonants like a code...

823
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:15,670
...to say what they really feel inside.

824
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:18,548
What? That's nonsense.

825
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:20,744
Give it to me. I'll try to crack it.

826
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,975
Crack what?

827
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,522
It's not like that.

828
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:28,449
Stop your nonsense.

829
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:31,484
Hey, my gut instinct has
always been right.

830
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:32,497
Hey!

831
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:37,568
I know it. I'm sure of it.

832
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,441
Why won't this come off?

833
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,936
Why won't this unfold?

834
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:51,592
Excuse me.

835
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:53,348
Oh, would you like to order?

836
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:56,345
- The menu's over there...
- No, that's not it.

837
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,225
I want you to have something to drink.

838
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,993
Oh, thank you.

839
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:05,665
You're Kook Kibong, right? The MVP
of the High School Baseball Tournament.

840
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,332
I've been a huge fan since high school.

841
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:09,516
Really?

842
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:12,173
I didn't know I still had fans.

843
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:15,347
This is my business card.

844
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:18,543
I'd like to treat you to a meal sometime.

845
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:20,812
I'd be happy to.

846
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,971
- Your name is Bora?
- Yes.

847
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:24,893
Thank you. I didn't know
I still had fans.

848
00:41:24,977 --> 00:41:25,950
Hey, Kook Kibong!

849
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:27,974
Shouldn't you be working?

850
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:29,005
What?

851
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,412
I'm done cleaning
and the tables are all set.

852
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:33,019
Do you think that's it?

853
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,093
You need to organize
the sauce containers...

854
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:36,995
...and the chopsticks.

855
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,192
And chase off the flies!

856
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,781
Okay, okay.

857
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,700
No need to blow a fuse.

858
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:47,109
Thank you for the drink.

859
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:48,520
Sure.

860
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:51,338
- I'll see you again.
- Okay.

861
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,909
Thank you.

862
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,724
Suyeon!

863
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,019
Ta-da!

864
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,529
Isn't that Wooshik's phone?

865
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:08,405
It is. I sneaked it from
him while he's asleep.

866
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:12,196
- Why?
- I wanted to decode Minah's text.

867
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:15,669
I have no doubt that she was
confessing her feelings for him.

868
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:17,812
Do you want to do it together?

869
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,157
What? I'll pass.

870
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,498
I have a lot to do
and I'm not interested.

871
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,518
Really? Okay.

872
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:27,768
Let's see.

873
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,034
Here it is.

874
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:33,479
"W, S, L"...

875
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,386
What does this mean?

876
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,023
Could it be...?

877
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:42,894
"Bruce Lee's abs are scary,
Journey to the West."

878
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,271
"Bruce Lee's lottery,
I'll give you, shower head."

879
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:51,035
Wait, maybe it's not Bruce Lee.

880
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:54,368
Then what does W, S, L stand for?

881
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:57,030
Is it "badger"?

882
00:42:58,294 --> 00:43:00,712
Maybe it's a word using W and S only.

883
00:43:00,797 --> 00:43:01,943
Is it?

884
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:03,561
W, S...

885
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,603
But you said you're not interested.

886
00:43:09,581 --> 00:43:11,764
I'm not.

887
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:13,934
I just got curious because of you.

888
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:14,852
Really?

889
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:18,291
Which word starts with W, S?

890
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:21,538
Wait a minute.

891
00:43:22,492 --> 00:43:23,534
"Wooshik"?

892
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:26,602
That's right, it is "Wooshik"!

893
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:27,983
It's "Wooshik".

894
00:43:34,188 --> 00:43:35,448
- Yuri.
- Yes?

895
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,938
Try some of this.

896
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:39,509
Thank you.

897
00:43:39,593 --> 00:43:40,788
Don't mention it.

898
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:42,289
I'm not sure if you'll like it.

899
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,255
- It looks delicious.
- Really?

900
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:48,803
How would you like to grab
a beer with me sometime?

901
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:51,329
Beer? I'd love to.

902
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:52,865
I love beer.

903
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:54,067
Me too.

904
00:43:54,152 --> 00:43:55,087
Really?

905
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:56,554
Why aren't you working?

906
00:43:56,638 --> 00:43:57,890
Are you done with the meal prep?

907
00:43:58,392 --> 00:43:59,416
Yeah.

908
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,400
Really? Enough for how many servings?

909
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:03,508
100 servings.

910
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,401
That's not enough!
Prepare for 200 servings!

911
00:44:07,763 --> 00:44:09,253
What? 200 servings?

912
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:11,745
What if we don't get that many customers?

913
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,508
Why would you think we won't
get that many customers?

914
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:16,438
There's no guarantee we will.

915
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:18,761
I have a feeling that we will.

916
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:21,535
I'll buy it all if we don't get
enough customers.

917
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,212
So start prepping right now.

918
00:44:23,842 --> 00:44:28,099
Fine, I will. Don't have to be so mean.

919
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,382
- Thank you.
- Sure.

920
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:31,726
It looks so good.

921
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:36,059
Don't you need to start preparing?

922
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:38,027
You must have so much free time.

923
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,614
Oh, okay.

924
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:50,988
"Filming in Progress, 'The Dirty Game'"

925
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:52,668
Hyunseong.

926
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:56,731
What brings you here?

927
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:02,111
Oh, yeah. I heard from the director
that you joined the cast. Congratulations.

928
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:03,039
Congratulations?

929
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:04,993
On what?

930
00:45:06,032 --> 00:45:07,455
Congratulations on what?

931
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:08,979
What's wrong, Jungi?

932
00:45:09,063 --> 00:45:10,984
I heard you asked the director to cast me.

933
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:13,240
Why did you do that?

934
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,118
I'm asking you why!

935
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:17,222
How did you...?

936
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:18,649
That's none of your business.

937
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:21,389
Just tell me why you did it.

938
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:26,557
I just thought you'd be
perfect for the role.

939
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,759
Also, I owed you one.

940
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:29,705
You owed me one?

941
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:32,649
And when did I ask you to pay me back?

942
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:35,383
Anyway, this is not how I work.

943
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:37,811
You go tell the director...

944
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:39,843
...that I'm not doing it.

945
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:43,335
You haven't changed a bit.

946
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,204
- What?
- Don't you get tired of...

947
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,115
...being so honest and
righteous all the time?

948
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:56,520
You think I'm a jerk who steals
roles using connections?

949
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,811
But I don't regret what I did.

950
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,864
I wouldn't be where I am
if I didn't take that role.

951
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:03,244
What?

952
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:08,077
You scumbag.

953
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:09,816
Yeah, I'm a scumbag.

954
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:12,703
But look where being honest got you.

955
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,486
You just a bit player who
fills in for others all the time.

956
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:20,085
Pride doesn't put food on your table.

957
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:22,723
And that's what everybody
does around here.

958
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,184
No one will ever appreciate
you for being honest.

959
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,523
You know that.

960
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:30,724
Anyway...

961
00:46:32,086 --> 00:46:33,938
...we're even now.

962
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:39,262
So whether you continue with
your mediocre life or take that role...

963
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,566
...it's up to you.

We're not getting any more
customers. Let's shut it down.

966
00:47:07,628 --> 00:47:08,711
Fine, whatever.

967
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:12,285
You can go home by yourself today.

968
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:14,780
What? By myself?

969
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,725
I'm going to grab a beer with
the guy from the next truck.

970
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,059
You go home first.

971
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:20,976
What?

972
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:24,590
Try this.

973
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:26,283
Thank you.

974
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:32,678
Bora, let's drink.

975
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:33,932
Sure.

976
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:39,412
I can't believe I'm drinking
beer with Kook Kibong.

977
00:47:39,497 --> 00:47:41,341
What an honor.

978
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,358
You flatter me.

979
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:46,354
Hey, shall we toast?

980
00:47:46,439 --> 00:47:48,008
- Shall we? Okay.
- Here we go.

981
00:47:48,093 --> 00:47:49,527
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

982
00:47:53,421 --> 00:47:58,175
By the way, what's your
relationship with her?

983
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,604
She's just my friend's sister.
My friend's sister.

984
00:48:04,163 --> 00:48:05,805
She's his older sister...

985
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,174
...but she's like an enemy
who's never of any help to him.

986
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,573
Enemy.

987
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:14,979
So Kibong is your brother's friend.

988
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:19,016
You guys looked so close
that I thought you two were dating.

989
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:19,934
What?

990
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,990
- Me and him?
- Yes.

991
00:48:22,074 --> 00:48:24,378
That's ridiculous.

992
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:27,251
A guy like him is
a complete turn-off for me.

993
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:31,286
I wouldn't date him if he was
the last guy on earth.

994
00:48:33,684 --> 00:48:37,531
Bora, please don't get the wrong idea.

995
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,419
She is the type that I hate the most.

996
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:42,822
She's grumpy, shameless, and vicious.

997
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:46,070
She is the worst kind of woman. The worst!

998
00:48:47,835 --> 00:48:50,035
Do you know what kind of guy he is?

999
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,457
He is...

1000
00:48:52,872 --> 00:48:55,070
And not long ago,
he was on a quiz show...

1001
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:57,716
...and he referred General Eulji Mundeok
as "Eulji Munquack."

1002
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:58,497
Right.

1003
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:01,934
She stole our money all the time
when we were in school.

1004
00:49:02,018 --> 00:49:03,841
- And not only that...
- Hold on.

1005
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:07,705
Can we please talk about something else...

1006
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:10,426
...other than her?

1007
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:12,785
Oh, I'm sorry.

1008
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,256
It seems like I made a mistake.

1009
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,913
Look at you. You made another mistake.

1010
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,894
Your whole life is a mistake.

1011
00:49:20,997 --> 00:49:23,873
You have no sense of
responsibility, petty jerk!

1012
00:49:24,351 --> 00:49:26,907
"Petty"? Are you done running your mouth?

1013
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,700
No, I'm not. What are you going to do?

1014
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:31,754
Forget it.

1015
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:35,761
Let's just forget about running
this food truck together!

1016
00:49:37,272 --> 00:49:39,802
What? Forget about running the food truck?

1017
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:44,314
Fine. What's the point of
running a food truck with...

1018
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:46,509
...a grumpy, shameless,
and vicious person like me?

1019
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:48,441
If you want to quit, then quit!

1020
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,073
You started it.

1021
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:53,674
Fine. I'm so freaking sorry.

1022
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:56,612
I'm going home. Have fun.

1023
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,238
What are you doing?

1024
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:03,822
Don't mind me and have fun.

1025
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:09,848
But I do mind.

1026
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:12,777
What?

1027
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:16,981
I do mind.

1028
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:19,552
So don't drink with another guy.

1029
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:22,850
What?

1030
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:26,624
What about you?

1031
00:50:28,629 --> 00:50:30,581
You don't mind about me?

1032
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:35,034
I do.

1033
00:50:37,555 --> 00:50:41,544
So don't smile at another girl.

1034
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:43,207
Don't be nice to another girl.

1035
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,613
There's "high-rank" too.

1036
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:05,531
"High-rank"?

1037
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,491
"High-rank"

1038
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:08,897
Suyeon, is there anything else?

1039
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:12,722
No, that's about it.

1040
00:51:13,202 --> 00:51:15,606
Maybe we can crack it
if we combine these words.

1041
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:19,170
I'll read out a few combinations
that make sense.

1042
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:20,708
- Listen.
- Okay.

1043
00:51:21,057 --> 00:51:24,641
"Wooshik, Rambo is running, murderer"?

1044
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:26,917
That doesn't make sense.

1045
00:51:28,033 --> 00:51:31,677
"Goat, Rambo is running, Soyang River."

1046
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:34,152
That sounds more absurd.

1047
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,381
Those combinations seem completely wrong.

1048
00:51:37,489 --> 00:51:40,710
No. These are the most likely ones.

1049
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:42,901
I don't know.

1050
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:46,114
Can we take a little break?

1051
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:48,559
I'm going to get a glass of water.

1052
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:53,110
I would have aced my CSAT
if I studied like this.

1053
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:54,979
Just what could it be?

1054
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:57,506
Jungi, you're back.

1055
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,253
Yeah.

1056
00:51:59,395 --> 00:52:00,228
What?

1057
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:02,165
Did you drink?

1058
00:52:02,363 --> 00:52:04,906
You said you wanted to celebrate.
Why did you drink alone?

1059
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,636
I'm sorry...

1060
00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:09,254
...but I'm tired so I'll go to my room.

1061
00:52:13,903 --> 00:52:15,002
What's up with him?

1062
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,296
Did something happen?

1063
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:37,988
"The Dirty Game"

1064
00:52:38,595 --> 00:52:41,263
Don't you get tired of being
so honest all the time?

1065
00:52:41,611 --> 00:52:43,360
You scumbag.

1066
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,729
Pride doesn't put food on your table.

1067
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,335
And that's what everyone
does around here.

1068
00:52:48,505 --> 00:52:52,503
No one will ever appreciate
you for being honest.

1069
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,871
You know that.

1070
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,645
"Dad"

1071
00:53:06,796 --> 00:53:08,155
Hi, Dad.

1072
00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:13,991
Well, I'm doing this and that.

1073
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:18,395
I'm doing my best.

1074
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:20,865
So stop bringing that up!

1075
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,270
"The Dirty Game"

1076
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:28,472
I got a casting offer for a new movie.

1077
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:30,842
The director is Na Joonho.

1078
00:53:31,634 --> 00:53:32,467
Yes.

1079
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:35,601
So don't worry about me.

1080
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:38,114
I'll call you again, Dad.

1081
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:39,550
Okay.

1082
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,224
"The Dirty Game"

1083
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:48,612
Okay.

1084
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:52,238
Everyone else does this.

1085
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:55,065
Why shouldn't I?

1086
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:03,781
"Yuri's Kitchen 31"

1087
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:04,743
Kibong.

1088
00:54:05,856 --> 00:54:07,351
What should we do now?

1089
00:54:08,855 --> 00:54:09,688
What do you mean?

1090
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,073
I mean...

1091
00:54:11,723 --> 00:54:16,066
...we should clearly define
our relationship.

1092
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:17,764
Oh, yeah.

1093
00:54:18,746 --> 00:54:19,757
We should.

1094
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:23,260
Can we be honest to each other?

1095
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:26,050
Do you...

1096
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:27,765
...like me?

1097
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:32,668
I'm not really sure.

1098
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:38,147
I just care about you, sort of.

1099
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:41,979
What about you?

1100
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:43,703
Me neither.

1101
00:54:44,653 --> 00:54:45,883
I'm not sure.

1102
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:48,285
To be honest...

1103
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:51,075
...I sort of care about you too.

1104
00:54:53,647 --> 00:54:56,487
It's ambiguous. Really ambiguous.

1105
00:54:57,376 --> 00:54:58,529
Yeah.

1106
00:54:59,772 --> 00:55:03,519
But if we jump in too quickly...

1107
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:08,049
...we might end up drifting further apart.

1108
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:11,844
I know. I don't want things to be
awkward between us.

1109
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,145
And Wooshik's going to have
a problem with that.

1110
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:18,850
Right. Wooshik will go
crazy if he finds out.

1111
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,912
Then what should we do?

1112
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:23,476
I don't know.

1113
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:30,590
How about we go on a date just once?

1114
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:33,856
If we don't feel anything
after that, we can break it off.

1115
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,983
Don't you think?

1116
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,308
That sounds good.

1117
00:55:37,393 --> 00:55:40,270
Really? Let's do it then.

1118
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:46,604
Are you hungry?

1119
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,107
You want me to make some spaghetti?

1120
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:50,850
Sounds great. I'll help you.

1121
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:53,200
Okay.

1122
00:56:01,936 --> 00:56:03,998
What in the world is it?

1123
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:06,943
Why can't we find the answer
when we spent all night on this?

1124
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:08,265
Jeongeun.

1125
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,495
Let's just give up now.

1126
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,937
I think we're close to cracking it.

1127
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:17,333
"Wooshik. L, I, W, W."

1128
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:22,312
Hold on. "L" must be...

1129
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,645
..."Wooshik, love"?

1130
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,296
It is. It's "Love"!

1131
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:28,385
Right, Suyeon?

1132
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:30,047
Oh, "Love"?

1133
00:56:30,269 --> 00:56:31,940
So it's "Love."

1134
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:35,541
Next is "I, W, W."

1135
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,161
This must be... "I will wait."

1136
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:40,631
"Wooshik, love, I will wait."

1137
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:41,732
It all adds up.

1138
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,368
It means she'll wait for Wooshik's love.

1139
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,212
Then what about "S, O, G"?

1140
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:47,130
I'm not sure.

1141
00:56:47,634 --> 00:56:49,658
"Wooshik, love, I will wait."

1142
00:56:49,972 --> 00:56:50,874
"Soyang River"?

1143
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:53,127
Does it mean she'll be
waiting at Soyang River?

1144
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:56,516
What? Why would she wait at Soyang River?

1145
00:56:57,026 --> 00:56:57,859
No?

1146
00:56:58,472 --> 00:56:59,988
"Wooshik, love, I will wait."

1147
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:01,366
Sun Wukong?

1148
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:03,076
Insane killer?

1149
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,312
Where did my phone go?

1150
00:57:07,611 --> 00:57:08,701
Why is the kitchen so messy?

1151
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:10,247
What are you two up to?

1152
00:57:10,332 --> 00:57:12,533
Well... We were just...

1153
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:13,450
Hey!

1154
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:15,707
Why is my phone here?

1155
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:16,781
The thing is...

1156
00:57:17,194 --> 00:57:19,681
...we were trying to decode
the text Minah sent yesterday.

1157
00:57:19,766 --> 00:57:22,625
What? So you stole my phone?

1158
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:23,567
Sorry.

1159
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:26,592
You guys seem to have
a lot of time on your hands.

1160
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,964
But we're almost done cracking it.

1161
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:33,695
Look. It turned out to be
"Wooshik, love, I will wait."

1162
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:38,153
- What?
- It means Minah will wait for your love.

1163
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:40,284
What on earth are you talking about?

1164
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,176
She's just my student.

1165
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:43,316
Wooshik.

1166
00:57:45,118 --> 00:57:45,944
What brings you here?

1167
00:57:46,028 --> 00:57:49,448
I was practicing singing at the studio,
but my voice keeps getting out of tune.

1168
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:51,520
- Oh, I see.
- Wait, Minah.

1169
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:53,261
What is it?

1170
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,091
That text you sent to Wooshik yesterday.

1171
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:57,908
What? What text?

1172
00:58:00,017 --> 00:58:02,724
This. The text you wrote
using only consonants.

1173
00:58:02,944 --> 00:58:05,443
This means, "Wooshik, love, I will wait."

1174
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:06,361
Right?

1175
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,090
- What?
- But what's the "S, O, G" at the end?

1176
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:12,182
I just can't crack it.

1177
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:14,624
I didn't send this.

1178
00:58:15,876 --> 00:58:17,520
It must have been Jaemin again.

1179
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:19,274
Who is Jaemin?

1180
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,598
My nephew. He just turned four.

1181
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:23,474
He takes my phone all the time...

1182
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:25,335
...and presses whatever he wants.

1183
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:27,666
He did it again.

1184
00:58:28,513 --> 00:58:29,581
I knew it.

1185
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:31,341
I told you it wasn't like that.

1186
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:32,481
What do you mean?

1187
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:34,272
She said...

1188
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,998
...you were trying to tell me
how you feel using this text.

1189
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:38,979
That's just ridiculous.

1190
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,630
It's not completely ridiculous.

1191
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:44,582
Actually...

1192
00:58:44,895 --> 00:58:46,927
...I used to like you before.

1193
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:49,493
You were my first love.

1194
00:58:51,606 --> 00:58:52,756
What? First love?

1195
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,728
This part looks good.

1196
00:59:04,412 --> 00:59:07,473
Sir, I did an analysis on the character.

1197
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:10,633
Since Yeongshik is suffering
from sociophobia...

1198
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:14,705
...he should stutter or have
difficulty making eye contact.

1199
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,543
We should emphasize
these kind of features.

1200
00:59:16,627 --> 00:59:17,463
What do you think?

1201
00:59:18,682 --> 00:59:20,998
I like it. It's a good idea.

1202
00:59:21,082 --> 00:59:23,691
It seems like you thoroughly
analyzed the scenario.

1203
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,986
Thank you.

1204
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:26,881
You haven't eaten yet, right?

1205
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:28,651
Why don't we talk over lunch?

1206
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:29,644
Okay.

1207
00:59:33,848 --> 00:59:34,681
Sir.

1208
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,374
Jeez. Not you again.

1209
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,341
Sir, I just can't understand.

1210
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:46,349
Can you please tell me why?

1211
00:59:46,558 --> 00:59:48,360
How could you do this all of a sudden??

1212
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,578
Jungi, why don't you go wait
at a nearby restaurant?

1213
00:59:52,662 --> 00:59:54,010
I'll be there soon. Sorry.

1214
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:55,341
Okay.

1215
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:02,471
It was already confirmed
that I would take the role.

1216
01:00:02,824 --> 01:00:04,497
I got chosen from the audition.

1217
01:00:04,582 --> 01:00:06,647
So why did you cut me out?

1218
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,162
How many times do I have to tell you?

1219
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:11,080
We found someone who's
more suitable for that role.

1220
01:00:11,164 --> 01:00:14,513
Sir, I've spent over 10 years
as a nameless actor.

1221
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,626
I thought this would be
my last opportunity.

1222
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:18,536
I laid my head on the block and practiced.

1223
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,766
I can do this, sir. Really!

1224
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:23,142
I told you, it's already been decided.

1225
01:00:23,226 --> 01:00:24,988
Why can't you understand?

1226
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:26,343
Sir!

1227
01:00:26,862 --> 01:00:28,758
I'm begging you, sir.

1228
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,446
Please give me one more chance.

1229
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:32,920
Please reconsider.

1230
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:35,860
Sir, please. I beg you.

1231
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:38,357
Please. I beg you.

1232
01:00:38,904 --> 01:00:40,470
I beg you, sir.

1233
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:44,888
Sir, I'm begging you.

1234
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:46,963
I don't have a choice either.

1235
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:49,464
The production will be ceased
unless we go with Hyunseong.

1236
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:51,615
Still, how could you do this?

1237
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:54,022
That role was mine.

1238
01:00:54,106 --> 01:00:56,448
I was chosen from the audition.

1239
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,911
I told you, it's already been decided.

1240
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:00,065
Wait.

1241
01:01:01,276 --> 01:01:02,772
Please, sir.

1242
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:05,695
I didn't even sleep or eat...

1243
01:01:05,957 --> 01:01:07,998
...and practiced really hard for this.

1244
01:01:08,768 --> 01:01:11,245
I can do this, sir.

1245
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:13,554
Sir...

1246
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,857
Please...

1247
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,456
Sir, please.

1248
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:27,017
I'm begging you.

1249
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,218
Please.

1250
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:30,430
I'm begging you.

1251
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,942
"The Dirty Game"

1252
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:54,823
You must be happy, Wooshik.

1253
01:01:54,913 --> 01:01:57,633
Minah is so cute and pretty,
and you're her first love.

1254
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:58,762
Enough already.

1255
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,813
It's not even a big deal.

1256
01:02:00,897 --> 01:02:02,319
Why isn't it a big deal?

1257
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,606
Hey, maybe Minah still likes you.

1258
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:07,524
What?

1259
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:10,237
She said it was a long time ago.

1260
01:02:10,322 --> 01:02:12,196
Still, why would she say
that in front of you?

1261
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,463
It's strange.

1262
01:02:13,623 --> 01:02:14,754
Don't you think, Suyeon?

1263
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:15,672
What?

1264
01:02:16,271 --> 01:02:18,043
I'm not sure.

1265
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:19,023
Hey, Kim Jeongeun!

1266
01:02:19,405 --> 01:02:21,591
Stop it or I will get angry for real.

1267
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:24,341
Okay. Don't get all mad about it.

1268
01:02:25,684 --> 01:02:27,711
Jungi, how were things at the studio?

1269
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:29,111
Did the meeting go well?

1270
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:33,797
What's with the look on your face?

1271
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:35,533
Did something happen?

1272
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,506
I quit.

1273
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:40,924
You quit? Quit what?

1274
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:42,492
I quit acting.

1275
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:44,949
I will never go back to acting again.

1276
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,041
What are you talking about? Hey, Jungi!

1277
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:57,462
Jungi! What's happened?

1278
01:02:57,547 --> 01:02:59,853
What do you mean you're quit acting?

1279
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:01,778
Open the door, please.

1280
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,747
Open the door!

1281
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,777
"Welcome to Waikiki Season 2"

1282
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:10,072
What happened to him?

1283
01:04:10,156 --> 01:04:11,596
What is he quitting acting?

1284
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,581
Maybe it's depression.

1285
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:15,332
I will find out why he's being like this
and make him snap out of it.

1286
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:17,188
I told you, I don't want
to talk about it.

1287
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:19,657
I'll tell you all my secrets.
You tell me yours.

1288
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:21,091
I used to like you.

1289
01:04:21,478 --> 01:04:23,453
We're going out on a date today, remember?

1290
01:04:23,537 --> 01:04:25,734
If it doesn't feel right, we'll just
go back to being friends.

1291
01:04:25,819 --> 01:04:27,665
I never thought I would
go on a date with you.

1292
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,916
We don't have anything in common.

1293
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:32,111
I didn't think we would
be this impossible.

1294
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:33,038
Hello.

1295
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:36,308
Don't you think Minah
still likes Wooshik?

1296
01:04:36,393 --> 01:04:38,154
I'm not really sure.

1297
01:04:38,224 --> 01:04:39,624
Does it bother you?
