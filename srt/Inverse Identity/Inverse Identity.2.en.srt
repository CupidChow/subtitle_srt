00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:07,133
There is only one young master in the family. Why should he be called the second young master?

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
The eldest young master of the Jian family has long been lost

3
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:13,666
Now this second young master is adopted

Uncle Chen

6
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:43,166
Can there only be one young master in the family?

7
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,666
certainly

His name is Yan

10
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,900
Don't you think this looks familiar?

11
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:10,800
Are they there?

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,833
it's him! Chase

13
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:12,333
Go quickly

14
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,900
How do they know?

15
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:25,733
you idiot

16
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,633
Go quickly

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
You are you okay?

18
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,733
I

19
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:57,500
who I am?

20
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,166
do not you remember?

21
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:06,866
so stupid

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,400
You said...

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
you are my young master?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
yes

25
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,433
That's not all

26
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,500
Don't touch my head

27
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,033
You have lost your memory and your temper has become even worse

28
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,600
I am the young master. Give me a glass of water

29
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:36,166
I can't control you anymore?

30
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,900
Is it really?

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,500
Why does this scene feel so familiar?

32
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,333
too hot

33
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,300
Give me a drink instead

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,766
Why is it cold water?

35
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,666
Pour another glass

36
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:29,300
use that

37
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,500
How could anyone have a bad temper with the young master?

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,500
Didn’t I drink?

39
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,766
Are you really my young master?

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
yes

41
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,266
go out to eat

42
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,366
What are you doing standing there?

43
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,166
Come over for dinner

I'm fine

ah

49
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,200
Do you know how to apply medicine?

50
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,266
It really hurts

51

let me ask you a question

56
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
If someone robs your things

57
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,733
what would you do?

58
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,366
Does this need an explanation?

59
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,933
Of course I will take it back

60
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,433
Do you want to murder your husband?

61
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,266
What if someone hurts you?

62
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,233
Of course I will take revenge and go back

63

what are you thinking?

64
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,100
