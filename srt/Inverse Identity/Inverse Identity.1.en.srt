00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,666
No need, I'll take a stroll

3
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:21,700
do not move

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,500
Who are you……

5
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:26,066
Shut up

6
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:28,800
What do you want to do?

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,266
Where have people gone? Find it for me

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,066
who?

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,466
Who's there? come out

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,233
go out

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,500
why look at me

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,566
Have you ever seen someone vomit after drinking too much?

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,500
Hello

14
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,466
come and pick me up

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,866
He is from the Jian family and we can't afford to offend him

16
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:52,666
let's go

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,166
Is that okay now?

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,466
who are you?

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,300
Why arrest me?

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,100
last night

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,200
Is it you who put the knife to my (neck)?

22
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:26,166
Are you afraid?

23
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:33,666
try it

24
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:42,600
What do you mean?

25
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,000
Why can't I go out?

26
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,233
Am I pretty?

27
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,633
It’s more beautiful if you look closer

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Scared?

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,166
Are you done with your anger?

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,333
Can I go?

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,900
up to you

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,633
You're back?

33
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,133
It turns out that you already knew that 

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,200
there are people outside chasing me

35
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,800
be my bodyguard

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
I'll protect you

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,433
sooner or later one day

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,300
I will tame you

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
Yan

40
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,066
Yan

41
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,100
Yan

42
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:02,966
Yan

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,366
Yan bodyguard

44
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,333
Pour me a glass of water

45
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:23,733
too hot

46
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:24,733
Change a cup

47
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:33,733
too cold

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,600
Change a cup

49
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,066
White water doesn’t taste good

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,266
Make me a cup of tea

51
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:49,700
Too bitter

52
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:50,566
Change

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,133
Don't force me

54
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,566
Yan, let me go

55
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,433
Yan

56
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,300
Yan

57
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,333
I didn't mean it

58
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,733
I really don’t know who the young master is

59
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:16,600
Are you still angry?

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,533
good body

61
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,666
keep it up

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,666
No need for you to tell me

63
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,266
How long are you going to watch outside the door?

64
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,100
Where are people?
