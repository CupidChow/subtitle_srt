what we were getting into.

The reason we tied the knot,
and somehow made it this far,

155
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,046
is because we were trying our best to keep
the family together.

All we ever wanted was just one thing.

180
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,198
-I hope you're not too busy to talk.
-I have to be somewhere in 30 minutes.

181
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,116
So talk. What?

182
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,243
Is this over?

183
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,869
Why would you say that?

184
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,162
You know it's been seven years?

185
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,539
And if we're not getting married,
then maybe we just

186
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,708
let it go.

187
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,126
Ga-eul, that's not--

188
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,879
Then what is it? Are you waiting to
save money till you've got enough?

189
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,507
I've made plenty
from my hairdressing work, you know.

190
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,716
That's not why I called you.

191
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,802

We're in our trail launch period,

00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,228

who aren't likely to get divorced.

[scoffs]

196
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,065
You have to be married to get divorced.

197
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,776
The more I thought about it,
you're the only one I thought of.

198
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,696
I want us to get married.

NAM CHANG-HEE, YEO GA-EUL

Ga-eul, I want us to build
a life together.

202
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,787
What exactly is this?

203
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,415
Well, it says that, for whatever reason,

204
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,002
should you decide that you don't want to
stay with me any longer,

205
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,089
I'm guaranteeing to make sure that you'll
have nothing to worry about financially.

206
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,675
[sobs] That's ridiculous. No…

207
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,845
I'll do whatever I have to
so we can be together, until the end.

208
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,015
I don't want to think
about that. [sniffles]

209
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,641
That's not gonna happen to us.

210
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,060
So then we sign it?

211
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,395
[chuckles]

212
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,355
I'll do it.

214
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,902
Hmm, what a story.

215
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,406
Whoa, who would have thought that marriage
could be the result of divorce insurance?

216
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,783
That wasn't even on our radar
when we created it, right?

217
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,036
It wasn't at all. Pretty ironic, yeah?

218
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,954
So wait. Could this be
our selling point then?

219
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:25,000
[sighs] Well, in any case,
now the rejection's been resolved.

-[Dae-bok] What? [gasps]

00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,966
-[Ah-young laughs]
-Cheeky old geezer.

224
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,634
Hey, you can't say
that to our team leader.

225
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,345
-It's all right.
-[Ah-young] Apologize right now.

226
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,306
-Wait a minute. Apologize right now.
-I'm all right. It's not important.

227
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,682
-Ah-young, stop.
-Guys, that was close.

228

about a team dinner, okay?

229
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,144
[Na-rae] I don't think
it's time to celebrate just yet.

-[Dae-bok] Oh.

231

MS. A RECENTLY TOOK OUT

235
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,572
I think this article was based
on Ms. Han's live stream

236
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,657
-she did the other day.
-Nonsense.

237
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,911
We're guilty of encouraging divorce now?
Who even writes stuff like this?

238
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,955
[sighs] It'll be easy to have
this article removed pretty quickly.

239
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,375
However, upper management has
become aware of this

240
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,459
which is concerning.

241
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,336
I mean, we're all concerned. Obviously.

242
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,714
Okay, but we have cases like Mr. Na's too.

243
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,132
It's true.

244
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,928
So then,
how are we going to convince them of this?

I…

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,441
got nothing.

I'll give you until our next team update

251
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,863
to come up with a solution to tackle this.

Until we can resolve this, there won't be
an official divorce insurance launch.

Oh, yeah. Come on then.

Make it quick though.

278
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,431
So, I've been scouted.

279
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,559
What? By whom?

280
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,270
Overseas.

281
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,647

[gasps]

283
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,736
That's why you checked out Singapore,
isn't it?

284
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,406
Huh, no wonder.

285
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,701
So you gonna do it?

286
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,287
You know, I think I might.

287
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,955

00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,052
Was it our senior managing director
who made that offer?

293
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,807
She needs
a risk surveyor to work alongside her.

295
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,189

And don't you worry
about your buddy, okay?

We both know we're passed that.

302
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,825
You won't regret it.

303
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:47,869
Uh-huh.

304
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,621
That's what's important.

You'll be great together, the two of you.

-[chuckles]
-[chuckles] It's happening, then.

307
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,964
And have you told her yet?

308
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,299
I was planning to tell her
once we've officially launched.

309
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,759
-Why wait?
-You know,

310
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,302
'cause we haven't finalized the insurance.

00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,390
Come on.

313
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,309
You being so particular

314
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,144
reminds me of the Jeon-man I know.

315
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,605
But then you're not like the Jeon-man
I remember either.

316
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,816
Ah, just the fact
that I took up divorce insurance

317
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,026
-is way out of character, dude.
-[chuckles]

318
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,236
[sucks teeth] I guess.

319
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,322
To be taking on this project
without complete certainty of success

320
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,699
truly is a leap of faith for you.

321
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,867
So then, Singapore!

322
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,160
A turning point, it sounds like.

323
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,579
-I hope so.
-[chuckles]

324
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,581
I'll be downstairs.

325
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
Doing what?

326
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,876
I just want to get this launch going ASAP.

327
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,961
Hold on a second.

328
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,589
Turning point… [sighs]

329
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,051
Turning point?

330
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,346

[Ah-young sighs]

333
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,401
All right, what is it, sir?

334
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,777
You can tell us.

335
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,447
Uh, oh… [chuckles] …it's actually…

336
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,823
[stammers] It's not what you think.

337
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
I just figured that perhaps
you young ladies would know…

338
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:09,993
About what?

339
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,828
The thing is,
is I'd like to get a gift for my wife,

340
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,371
but I don't know what, you know?

341
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,706
-[Han-deul gasps] Oh.
-[exclaims]

342
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,207
Sweet.

343
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,169
I'm not exactly well-versed in that area.

344
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,837
-[inhales]
-[Han-deul] Aw.

345
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,381
So what do women like?

346
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,841
Cold, hard cash is always a good choice.

347
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,219
You know, I personally would prefer a gift
that shows some true care and effort.

348
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:31,056
"Care and effort"? Oof, that sounds hard.

349
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,770
Okay, you need to figure out

350
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,397
what she really wants deep down.
You need to use your instincts.

351
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,524
-Ah, I'm with you. Very true.
-Mmm, use my instincts.

352
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,318
-[Ah-young] Yep.
-That sounds even harder.

353
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,070
That's how you show her
how you really care.

354
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,154
By hitting a home run.

355
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,031
You can't do that
unless you genuinely care.

356
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,034
How about we take a look
at your wife's social media?

357
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,161
Uh-huh. Give me your phone.

358
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,537
-My phone?
-Yeah, just give it to me.

359
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,873
What do you need my phone for?

360
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,460
Let's have a look.
Let's have a little browse, sir.

361
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,170
[Ah-young] Mmm.

362
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,464
Interesting.

363
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,301
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS
HOPE TO SEE THEM BEFORE I DIE

364
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,303
-Hey, there you go.
-What is it?

365
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,097
What? The Northern Lights?

366
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,141
You'd have to travel to the other side of
the world, so it's a bit much, I think.

367
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,976
I wouldn't worry about it too much, sir.

368
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,104
[inhales, sighs]

369
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,023
-[Ah-young] You got this, Mr. Na!
-How do I even do this…

370
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,025
Hey, you two.
This is no time to be slacking off.

371
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,820
Could you go over
this list of risks I've drafted, sir?

372
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:27,904
[Dae-bok] What?

373
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,698
Let's see.

374
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,332
[typing]

375
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,251
MS. KANG - MR. NOH,
YOU SHOULD HEAD HOME FIRST

376
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,045
[typing]

377
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,630
MR. NOH
WHY? ARE YOU WORKING LATE?

378
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,174
[typing]

379
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,301
NO, I WANT TO VISIT MY PARENTS,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME

380
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,891
I'M NOT WORRIED, I KNOW
YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

381
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,019
[chuckles]

382
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,271
[gentle music playing]

383
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,858
[clears throat]

384
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,695
"The policyholder and the insured
commit to these terms for…"

385
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,165
Ta-da!

386
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,001
What's this? Bought them off the street?

387
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,461
No, I've…

388
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,339
I've chosen each of these,
and they're all as stunning as you are.

389
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,549
Don't be silly.

390
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,510
Goodness, look at all this laundry.

391
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,888
All right, I'm gonna fold these.

392
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,265
It's gonna look nice and neat in here.

393
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,475
[Dae-bok grunts]

394
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,226
One percent is the deal.

395
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,145
Don't do everything in one day, okay?

396
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,313
You'll get tired.

397
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,357
Tired? You really don't know
your husband, do you?

398
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,528
I may have ruined my liver and stomach
drinking every day for years,

399
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,157
but, uh…
But the heart is going strong as ever.

400
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,368
And it only beats for you. [chuckles]

401
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,037
Hmm.

402
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,165
Last I looked,

403
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,501
this isn't a theater.

404
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,294
You wanted to see a movie.

405
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,130
Well, it's more comfortable to watch
them at home.

406
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:10,882
You didn't know?

407
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,801
Hmm.

408
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,347
Um, where are the dishes?

409
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,682
-Uh, they're in the cupboard.
-In here?

410
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,439
[pensive music playing]

411
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,737
[chuckles]

412
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,077
[joyful music playing]

413
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,246
[Na-rae clears throat]

414
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,790
[person] Does it bother you?
How they look at us?

415
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,836
[robot] They see what they expect to see,
a machine. But you…

416
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,379
-[person] I see you.
-[Jeon-man sighs]

417
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,714
[robot] This feeling,
it wasn't in my programming.

418
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,716
This awareness of you.

419
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,263
How can something be wrong when it makes
all my systems align in perfect harmony?

420
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,648
[person] I never expected to find
connection here.

421
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,401
In the middle of all this noise.

422
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,403
[robot] Perhaps that's where
connection matters most.

423
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,946
No trouble focusing.

424
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,447
[sighs]

425
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,122
It appears you really loved this movie.

426
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,331
You were watching so intently,

427
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,917
I thought you were about to be
sucked right into the screen.

428
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,086
It was better than I thought.

429
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,046
Well, I thought it was so-so.

430
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,799
The whole human-robot love thing
doesn't do it for me.

431
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,967
I feel the opposite.

432
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,678
-Oh?
-[Jeon-man] Well…

433
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,475
It's a widely known thing that people
choose names for their vehicles

434
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,145
or bond with their robots,
like their vacuum.

435
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,648
[sighs] Such a waste of emotions.

436
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,650
But emotions aren't something
you can suppress.

437
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,445
That said,
if humans need love so desperately

438
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,363
that we're even loving machines…

439
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,949
So then why do we get divorced?

440
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,618
That's my question.

441
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,202
Does that make sense to you?

442
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,789
I mean, if you're not compatible
you just get divorced.

443
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,583
Well, humans and robots
aren't really compatible.

444
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,503
[clears throat] All right, so?

445
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,173
[sighs] What's your point?

446
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,383
Perhaps divorce isn't the only solution.

447
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,885
[Na-rae] Mmm.

448
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,472
I think we have to include that
within our insurance policy.

449
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,225
Wow, you're really serious about this.

450
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,977
It's time to get serious.

451
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,068
[romantic music playing]

452
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,165
[record scratch]

453
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,417
[Jeon-man] All right.

454
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,753
Oh, I wasn't finished yet.

455
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,215
There's some wine left.
Do you wanna watch another movie?

456
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,342
Sorry, there's work I have to do.

457
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,010
Um, right now?

458
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,265
I'll watch another movie and finish this
while you do your work.

459
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,435
-You're done with this, aren't ya?
-No, there's some left.

460
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,812
Well, it's only a little.

461
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,071
-Okay, okay. I'll go.
-Okay. Sorry, I can't walk you out.

462
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,823
-Okay, I'm walking. No need to push.
-Okay.

463
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,449
-Oh, I forgot my bag. It's right there.
-Ah.

464
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,951
Go ahead and put your shoes on.

465
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,787
-[Jeon-man pants]
-Uh…

466
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,373
[Jeon-man grunts] There you go.

467
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,499
[door beeps]

468
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,254
I can't leave without my shoes on though.

469
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,131
Uh-huh. Faster please. Do it quick.

470
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,298
It's all right, you're good.

471
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,930
Uh, are you sure I should go?

472
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,765
Yeah, I really have to work.

473
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,475
You're serious?

474
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,144
Yeah, I need to work. I do.

475
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,564
Goodbye. I'll see you tomorrow.

476
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,065
[Na-rae] No, wait…

477
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,984
[door beeps]

478
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,320
God. What the hell was that?

479
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,078
[whimsical music playing]

480
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,142
[no audible dialogue]

481
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,729
[Ki-jun sighs] Encouraging divorce, huh?

482
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,150
Encouraging divorce…

483
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,861
[Dae-bok] My wife and I
were reflecting on our past.

484
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,613
I have a repeat divorcé to thank.

485
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,657
You said, "My past would reveal
all that I'm looking for."

486
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,201
You were dead right about that.

487
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,827
Encouraging divorce…

488
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,621
[Ki-jun] A turning point, it sounds like.

489
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,248
Mm-mmm.

490
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,876
[exhales] Huh?

491
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,087
-[chuckles]
-Ms. Kang. Oh…

492
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,296
[Han-deul] Oh.

493
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,215
-[chuckles]
-Oh…

494
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,675
-Looks like you leveled up from the swing.
-Yeah, I know.

495
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,010
So, what were you doing out here?

496
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,012
Uh, you know. I was just, um…

497
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,014
You're worried that you can't find
the solution?

498
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,642
There are plenty of sparks flying
around in there.

499
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,394
Just not the explosion I want.
I don't have it yet.

500
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,438
It's better if we work on this together.

501
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,524
Don't put all the burden on yourself.

502
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,275
Yeah, but everything started
in my head, so…

503
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,902
[sighs]

504
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,403
You need to snap out of it.

505
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,697
-And I've got the perfect solution.
-Hmm?

506
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,159
-[grunts, chuckles]
-[chuckles]

507
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,039
-Oh! Uh…
-[laughs]

508
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,207
Aw, no.

509
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,459
-You have to keep the big one. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

510
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,253
Mmm. It's pretty good.

511
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,381
[both chuckle]

512
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,008
Oh.

513
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,678
The bed… I wanted to thank you.

514
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,971
It's miraculous. [chuckles]

515
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,514
Ah, come on. Don't mention it.

516
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,141
What's that compared to what's
in my fridge?

517
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,809
[Han-deul chuckles]

518
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,477
How'd everything go with your parents?

519
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,979
[chuckles]

520
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,606
Mmm. They've give up on their daughter,

521
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,983
-so… [chuckles]
-What?

522
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,695
It means they have accepted

523
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,738
who I really am.

524
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:08,906
[Ki-jun] Hmm.

525
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,368
Yeah, my father isn't very good
at expressing his feelings.

526
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,162
-Ah.
-[chuckles]

527
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,038
[sighs]

528
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,332
You know, I've never fully conveyed

529
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,210
how I actually feel about this stuff
to my parents.

530
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,879
I just always went like,

531
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,548
"I don't want to make them sad
or mad or anything.

532
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,009
If I can just hold it in
and bottle up my feelings,

533
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,136
everything is gonna be great."

534
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,930
Only now… [sighs]

535
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,975
…I do feel like I caused
this whole mess to begin with.

536
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,769
Hey, don't carry that burden.

537
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,480
I think I just wanna reflect.

538
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,858
-Reflect?
-Mm-hmm.

539
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,278
'Cause I wanna take this thing by
the horns and face it, you know?

540
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,447
So, even if it feels uncomfortable,

541
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,407
or even if they hate me for it,

542
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,828
those emotions I'm trying to avoid
are still mine in the end.

543
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,788
I'm really at
the heart of this whole thing.

544
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,210
It's true. You're right at the heart of it
in the end.

545
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,294
[Han-deul] Yeah.

546
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,675
Something about the heart.

547
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,053
[dramatic music plays]

548
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,138
-I've got it.
-What?

549
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,474
The solution.

550
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,226
[chuckles]

551
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,020
A "self-care program"?

552
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,731
One person starts off alone
and then another joins them

553
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,066
and they're together.

554
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,609
Only for them to get divorced.

555
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,277
Now we're trying to return them to
the beginning.

556
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,030
Like salmon swimming upstream,
back to where they were born.

557
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,366
So, the goal is to return home.

558
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,577
That is to say, to the heart of it all,
to the core of who we are.

559
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,789
So could you use this
on the couples we've worked with?

560
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,582
Not Kim Seon-man, of course.

561
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,793
[sighs]

562
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,005
You were always searching
for something beyond your reach

563
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,465
when I was right there by your side.

564
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,008
I wanted your acknowledgment

565
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,593
and that's why I tried to prove it.

566
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:55,096
Do you remember when we went on the trail?

567
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,723
I wanted to give up and even though
we were strangers, you helped me.

568
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,934
As soon as I put your hand in mine,

569
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,437
I had already acknowledged you.

570
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,316
-[gasps] What're you doing here?
-What're you doing here?

571
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,486
Is it important that the couple visit you
during every holiday?

572
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,570
-No.
-Yes.

573
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,406
[sighs]

574
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,449
-[gasps] What did you say?
-What did you say?

575
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,119
You've successfully resolved the issue
regarding the holidays, I assume?

576
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,745
Our place in even years

577
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,914
and her place in odd years.

578
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,041
I believe it's better
to address everything openly

579
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,085
before the wedding
so there are no surprises later.

580
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,299
[sighs]

581
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,758
OPTIONS FOR NEW HOME

582
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,387
MONEY GIFT FROM MY HUSBAND
FOR MY 60TH BIRTHDAY

583
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,806
Oh, that woman.
She never spent any of this.

584
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,058
That foolish lady.

585
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,439
[gasps, mutters]

586
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,776
I'll improve 1% each day…

587
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,155
until I'm a hundred percent different.

588
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,823
POLICYHOLDER: LEE SO-JEONG
INSURED: LEE SO-JEONG

589
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,285
So you had mentioned that 1% per day.

590
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,661
Keep your word.

591
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,956
The only way to know
who we are is to face reality.

592
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,041
And when we do,

593
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,877
we can then begin to understand
the person we're with too.

594
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,961
That's correct.

595
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,922
This becomes not only a turning point,
it's a new starting point as well.

596
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,633
So, it's the courage to start over.
Would you agree with that?

597
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,761
It's the very same courage
Mr. Kim needed to divorce.

598
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,472
In summary,
we need to have divorce insurance…

599
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:23,017
To keep track of, and understand,
why a lot of couples face divorce.

600
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,561
Does this encourage divorce in any way?

601
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,396
-You know the answer.
-[all] It doesn't!

602
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,647
-Right on.
-[Ah-young] Ah!

603
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,859
It reminds of taking out health insurance
to keep your body healthy.

604
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,236
Just that, it's about your relationship
and your marriage.

605
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,738
-Mm-hmm, you got it.
-So the same way

606
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,574
health coverage will make sure
medical expenses are taken care of,

607
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,035
we'll have the self-care program
provide funds when we think

608
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,411
there's a risk of divorce.

609
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,746
-[Ah-young] Yeah.
-That's really good.

610
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,539
Okay, let's get to it.

611
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,665
-[Ki-jun] Yes, ma'am.
-Yes.

612
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,376
-You did it again.
-Yeah.

613
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,710
-Congrats.
-Let's make it work.

614
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,215
-["You Never Know" playing]
-Great. We got this.

-Hey, review this for me?

-See you tomorrow, sir.

-See you tomorrow, sir.
-Great work today, sir.

621
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,031
-Keep it up, ladies.
-Great work today.

622
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,991
-See ya.
-Okay, I'm off.

623
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,035
-See you tomorrow. Hang in there.
-See you.

624
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,800
-[sighs] Ms. Kang.
-[Jeon-man] You stayed all night?

625
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,093
[Ah-young] Morning, everyone.

626
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,469

-Right up there.
-Okay.

Right, Mr. Na?

00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,321
-How're we doing?
-Oh, Ms. Jeon.

632
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,407
-Ms. Jeon.
-[Jeon-man cheers]

633

-Oh, hello, ma'am.
-It's for you. Here.

00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,201
-[Ki-jun] Oh, my gosh. Amazing.
-Whoa.

635
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,537
-It's yours, go on.
-You really went out of your way?

636
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,881
-[whispers] I'm gonna get out of there.
-I'll go with.

637
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,716
-I'll head out too.
-[shushes]

638
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,926
-Just go.
-Good luck to you.

[Han-deul groans]

640
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,481
Little bit tired?

641
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,149
I must have fallen asleep.

642
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,901
Did everybody leave?

643
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,527
Yeah, just now.

644
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,117
Here, Ms. Kang. For you.

645
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,914
To wake you up.

646
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,375
That's sweet of you.

647
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,922
But I need to wake up too.

00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,425

Almost there.

652
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,976
Let's get it done.

[sighs]

654
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,986
[sighs] I do think that's all we need.

655
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,030
What do you all think?

656
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,157
-I say we're done. You?
-Okay.

657
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,659
-You, Ms. Joh?
-Yeah.

658
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,452
And Mr. Na? Ms. Jeon, what about you?

659
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,248
-All right, Ms. Kang?
-There is just one more thing.

660
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,041
Mm-hmm?

661
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,044
We have to take a look at
the AI underwriting process.

662
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,504
As we've learned from the trial sales,

663
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,256
we'll have to expect changes
going forward.

664
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,883
-[sighs] I forgot about that.
-Mm-hmm.

665
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,843
I would like to participate.

666
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:45,928
Huh?

667
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,598
I'm part of the team, aren't I?

668
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,684
-[Dae-bok] Ah.
-[Han-deul] That'd be great.

are gonna be totally different.

-Great work. Great work, son.
-We did it.

688
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,617
So, the official launch
is gonna be decided

689
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,785
once the executives confirm it all.

690
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:54,455
And, listen.
I appreciate everyone's hard work.

691
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,123
-Yours too.
-Great work, ma'am.

-You did great.
-[Jeon-man] Whoa.

693
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,959
[Han-deul] Well done, everyone.

694
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,712
-You did amazing.
-Yeah, I gave it my all.

-What's the date today?
-I think pulling so many all-nighters,

I lost track of time.

00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,178
Hey, you know what this character is?

698
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,180
-Home?
-Home.

699
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,556
Go home now.

700
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,641
Go home. Yeah.

701
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,226
Go home now!

702
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,063
-We get to go!
-All right! Let's get out of here!

703
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:20,898
-See you later, sir.
-Let's go!

704
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,067
Hey, Ms. Joh! No, Ms. Joh!

705
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,695
Ms. Joh!
How dare she leave before her superior?

706
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,781
-[Han-deul chuckles]
-Ms. Joh!

707
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,413
DIVORCE INSURANCE
OFFICIAL LAUNCH PROPOSAL DRAFT

708
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:05,693
Good morning.

709
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,736
I know we see each other every day,

710
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,571
but today
somehow feels like it's been forever.

711
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,657
[sighs] That's because
all we do is work every day.

712
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,741
Anyway,

713
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,244
at least we avoided burn out.

714
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,456
-There's your recharge.
-[chuckles]

715
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,545
There's yours.

716
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,060
[people chattering]

717
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,520
LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT

718
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,606
[chattering continues]

719
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,698
LAUNCH ANNOUNCEMENT
PRODUCT NAME: DIVORCE INSURANCE

720
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,374
One more to a hundred. You got this.
Do it, do it!

721
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,793
-[groaning]
-Come on. Come on. Two more, two more.

722
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,670
Let's go!

723
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:09,047
-[Na-rae] Good morning, everyone.
-Oh, no, wait.

724
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,924
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Morning, ma'am.

725
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,968
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning to you too.

726
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,220
Oh, it's so very good to see you.
[chuckles]

727
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:18,390
I feel like it's time
to disband our task force.

728
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,809
Sorry?

729
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,855
[stammers, sighs]

730
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:30,736
Well, with the launch date now confirmed,
your work here is all done now.

731
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:31,904
[sighs]

732
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:33,989
[sighs] Oh, wow. So this is how it ends.

733
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,658
Now that it's actually ending… [chuckles]

734
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,868
…it's really bittersweet.

735
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,788
Well, it'll be a fond memory.

736
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,457
And soon we'll be
right back in the thick of it.

737
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,583
That's right.

738
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,211
So, back to our respective teams, I guess?

739
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:51,006
Yes. But before that,
how about a dissolution ceremony?

740
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,382
Oh.

741
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,926
What? We're getting dinner?

742
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,762
-Mm-hmm.
-A team dinner? I love the sound of that.

743
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,847
[chuckles] Ah.

744
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,307
Actually, I can't go to that.

745
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,309
-Why not?
-[chuckles]

746
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,853
-Ah, right.
-The beach!

747
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:06,730
Beach?

748
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:09,566
I think we need a break
from this stuffy old office

749
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,193
and go get some fresh air outside.

750
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm down. I've been wanting to go there.

751
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,947
-Yeah, me too. Let's go.
-Great idea, Ms. Joh.

752
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,740
-Beach it is!
-[chuckles]

753
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:17,825
Hmm.

754
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,286
Should we check which one is the safest?

755
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,080
-Ah, yeah, I'll check.
-I'm on it. Let's figure this out.

756
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,589
[line ringing]

757
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:33,799
Hello, Seok-gi.

758
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,885
So, this thing I mentioned
when I last talked to you…

759
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,887
Let's leave together
as soon as we're done.

760
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,681
-Okay, sounds good.
-Great. We can go together.

761
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,349
-So are we going right now?
-Yeah, right now.

762
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,060
-[Dae-bok groans]
-What's a good restaurant?

763
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,020
-Mr. Na, where'd you go?
-Uh, nowhere.

764
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,605
Just, someone stopped by.

765
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,023
You better go.
It's getting busy out there.

766
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,108
-Yeah, on our way out.
-Yeah.

767
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,485
We haven't had chicken
and beer in a while. Join us, sir.

768
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:58,448
[sighs]
I've been trying to cut back on drinking.

769
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,659
Hmm. How about you skip the beer, sir?

770
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,244
-Join us for chicken.
-Yeah.

771
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,328
Chicken?

772
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,998
Man, I seriously can't say no to that.

773
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,125
Just a minute. [grunts]

774
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,461
Hi, sweetheart.

775
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,173
Listen, don't worry about dinner tonight.
I'll get us chicken, okay?

776
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,801
-[whispers] I'll be out there.
-Ooh.

777
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,219
Is marinated okay? Half and half?

778
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,597
Is it even all right for people
to change that fast?

779
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,807
I barely recognize the guy. [chuckles]

780
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,934
-I hear that when people change suddenly--
-[Han-deul groans]

781
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,603
Don't say anything else. [chuckles]

782
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,479
-Looks good on him, I think.
-I agree.

783
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,148
-Let's go then, shall we? Okay.
-Let's do it.

784
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,405
Say, honey,
what's a place you'd like to visit?

785
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,283
There's none I can think of, honestly.

786
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,285
I've been to so many places recently.

787
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,412
Seok-gi says there's this place

788
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,707
that can reignite
even the faintest embers of love.

789
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,542
I doubt such a place exists.

790
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,586
No, it's real I'm not just saying that.

791
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,504
Enough with the nonsense, okay?

792
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,631
Just pass the laundry.

793
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:06,683
What's this?

794
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,645
WOOSEOK TRAVEL AGENCY
ITINERARY

795
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,855
[joyful music playing]

796
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,815
Let's travel to the Northern Lights.

797
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,859
We should see them together.

798
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,823
It's normal to do vow renewals.

799
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,035
I wanna have another honeymoon.
That's what this is, sweetheart. Hmm?

800
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,414
It's not a dream, is it?

801
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,916
[chuckles]

802
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,502
The flight's tomorrow night.

803
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,838
Can we really afford this?

804
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,342
Let's pack, honey.

805
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,886
Hey! The credit card bill is gonna be due.

806
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,646
[sighs]

807
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,200
It's our honeymoon, isn't it?

808
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,576
Is that right?

809
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,248
[both chuckling]

810
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,553
[Ah-young] We're on the beach! Whoo!

811
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,891
["You Never Know" playing]

812
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,976
Hurry up!

813
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,605
God, it feels so good out here.

814
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:36,940
Open space, nice breeze…

815
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,692
She's the best sea of all, the East Sea.

816
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,818
[Ki-jun] Very true.

817
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,571
[Han-deul] It's so nice.
I haven't been to the beach in ages.

818
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,364
Huh.

819
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,615
Yeah. And the weather's perfect.

820
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:46,908
All right, everyone, picture time!

821
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,368
-Oh, yeah.
-[Ki-jun] All right.

822
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,664
Okay. One, two, three!

823
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,875
Looks great! Another one.

824
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,626
[shutter clicks]

825
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,253
Hey. Go on.

826
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,337
-How about--
-Uh-huh.

827
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,423
One more, like…

828
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,593
Okay, that's great.

829
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,262
And one, two, three.

830
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,431
Selfie, come on.

831
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,266
-Make a heart!
-[Ki-jun] K heart.

832
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,188
BIG BRO DAE-BOK

833
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,355
Hey Mr. Na! Wait…

834
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,815
-Hello!
-What are you wearing?

835
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,067
[Han-deul] Hello there, sir.

836
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,152
We got here safely. It's all good.

837
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,822
Have a look! Isn't this crazy, huh?
[chuckles]

838
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,324
-How are things there?
-All good.

839
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,451
-We're having fun.
-Oh, sir, I love your hat!

840
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,411
It's incredible to see all this!

841
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:33,955
Don't have too much fun
while Mr. Na is away, okay?

842
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,209
Yes, sir, you bet! We're pretty much
bored out of our minds without Mr. Na!

843
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,252
-Come back, Mr. Na!
-But don't worry about us.

844
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,837
-Enjoy yourself.
-Okay, sounds good, all right then.

845
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,047
-I'll see you later!
-See you soon!

846
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,632
-See you later!
-Bye, Mr. Na.

847
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,968
-[sighs]
-What's happening?

848
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,428
-We should get going.
-Huh?

849
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,638
You really wanna go already?

850
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,431
-We need a good spot.
-Ah, right. Okay then.

851
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,350
-Oh, he… Hello, hello!
-Hello!

852
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,645
Hey! What?

853
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,272
[laughs] Wait. No!

854
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:12,702
That's cute.

855
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,122
[chuckles]

856
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:18,959
What? What is it?

857
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,544
You thought I wouldn't even look at this?

858
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:23,046
Oh, no, not at all.
No, that's not what I thought.

859
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,548
[chuckles]

860
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,717
I used to see the world
mainly from an investment perspective.

861
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,761
Always arguing and calculating risks.

862
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:35,517
It's only now that I'm starting to see all
of the little things that are in between.

863
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,770
I feel that's really a testament
to how committed you are.

864
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,402
I'm, uh, going back to Singapore.

865
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,446
And when are you going?

866
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,740
Well, right after our launch.

867
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,161
[sighs] That's too bad.

868
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:58,498
I just recently started
to feel comfortable around you.

869
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,250
Is that so?

870
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,962
At first, you were simply our superior.

871
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,046
So…

872
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,259
naturally, there were walls there,
you know?

873
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,846
And then we became a team, and…

874
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,640
the walls disintegrated.

875
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,520
I mean, what else is there to consider?

876
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,815
Kang Han-deul and Jeon Na-rae.

877
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,942
That's all that matters.

878
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:33,950
[sighs]

879
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,455
You still haven't told her you're going?

880
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,916
[sighs] That's a wuss move, seriously.

881
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,417
I will tell her today.

882
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,253
All right, that's the spirit.

883
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:46,713
Don't make her wait.
I've made that mistake.

884
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,175
Aren't you at least a little bit sad
that we won't be together?

885
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,094
[sighs] Jesus. Seriously?

886
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,680
What am I, your lover?

887
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,933
-We're friends.
-Exactly.

888
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,185
And all that matters with friends
is to know your friend's okay.

889
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,394
So, take good care of yourself.

890
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,481
Oh, and grab some whiskey at the duty-free
when you come back.

891
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,607
Whiskey's expensive.

892
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,610
-I'll just grab some mango jelly for you.
-Oh, and bring me some kaya jam.

893
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,861
-Dang, you're nuts.
-[chuckles]

894
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,863
[chuckles]

895
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:12,948
Mmm.

896
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,325
[Ah-young clears throat]

897
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,495
-We're only here because of Woong-sik.
-Hmm?

898
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,622
-[patron] Over here!
-Hmm. [clears throat]

899
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,208
Congrats on the official launch
of divorce insurance.

900
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,335
-Mmm.
-Thanks, whoo!

901
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,879
And you, as well.
You really helped us out with it.

902
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,923
I'm happy to hear that. [chuckles]

903
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:34,261
Although, was it just by accident that you
came to the village at planting season?

904
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:36,888
Ah…

905
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,224
[clears throat]

906
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,852
Mmm! The water's really good. Try some.

907
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,187
[chuckles]

908
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:50,485
Have some of this.

909
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,112
[chuckles]

910
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,407
-[chuckling]
-What's with you two?

911
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,574
Just getting to know each other.

912
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:57,909
Getting to know what exactly?

913
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,995
Stop prying so much, leave it alone.

914
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,079
It's personal.

915
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,623
-Say something to her.
-Ah.

916
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,916
They'd be cute as a couple.

917
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,543
I feel like you'd be great together.

918
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,878
-Whoa!
-Here it is, here it is!

919
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,506
-Looks so good! Wow!
-Okay. Here's your order.

920
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,632
-Enjoy.
-Whoa! Beautiful.

921
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:14,801
-[Ah-young] Thank you so much.
-[Jeon-man] Thank you.

922
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,053
-This looks really amazing.
-Mmm.

923
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,179
Here, have this.

924
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,307
-Cheers.
-We're eating till they close.

925
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,017
-[chuckles]
-Cheers to closing!

926
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,731
Ms. Jeon's leaving to go to Singapore
next week.

927
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,233
[coughs]

928
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:31,818
Singapore?

929
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,445
Well, that took a turn.

930
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,072
Well, you should visit
at some point if you can.

931
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,533
Sounds great.
And you're footing the bill, yeah?

932
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,909
Well, sure. Why not?

933
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,081
Or don't come if you don't want to.

934
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:47,959
Come on, tell her.

935
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,378
What am I gonna do
when you're gone, though?

936
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,049
You're our badass Ms. Jeon.
And now you're leaving.

937
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,884
My role model's gone.

938
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,386
[chuckles]

939
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,431
I do appreciate it. Role model, huh?

940
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,309
So, Na-rae. Can I call you Na-rae?

941
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,733
I just, um,

942
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,986
I mean since we're all done with the job,
we can drop the formalities, right?

943
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,071
Ah-young, don't--

944
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,948
-Ah-young, you can't use her first name.
-I can't?

945
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,617
-[retches]
-Oh!

946
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,535
-[retches]
-Woong-sik!

947
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,288
-[Jeon-man] There she goes.
-Figures.

948
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,539
I was thinking he should slow down.

949
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,792
-He'll mess up his white pants.
-Darn, not surprised though.

950
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,252
Ah-young got a little drunk, I think.

951
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,337
I hope you understand.

952
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,089
Alcohol makes people a little wild.

953
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,508
Na-rae?

954
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,760
That little… [clicks tongue]

955
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,346
I actually like it.

956
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:42,972
Na-rae?

957
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,432
[chuckles]

958
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:45,517
Hmm.

959
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,521
-[Ki-jun scoffs]
-[chuckles]

960
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,189
[clears throat, chuckles]

961
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,315
-Na-rae?
-Hmm.

962
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,609
-It's pretty cute.
-Hmm.

963
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,028
I need to get some fresh air.

964
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,656
-Oh, hey, Ms. Kang. Wanna join me?
-Oh, sure.

965
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,951
We're just gonna be a minute.

966
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,329
[Ki-jun clears throat]

967
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,416
[whispers] Hey, man. Stop being a wuss.

968
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,088
You know,
it's kind of hard to breathe in here.

969
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,925
-It's a bit stifling, don't you think?
-I don't feel that way.

970
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,009
[Jeon-man] Hmm.

971
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,930
[people chattering]

972
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,352
[sighs]

973
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,730
[camper 1] I can't wait for it,
I'm so excited.

974
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,607
[camper 2] It's gonna be fine.
Just chill out.

975
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,317
[all gasp]

976
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,986
Oh! So amazing.

977
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,113
[gasps, sighs]

978
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,827
Hey, sweetie. Look, it's happening!

979
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:49,164
-Sweetheart!
-I closed my eyes for a s…

980
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,876
Whoa!

981
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,006
[So-jeong] Did you know?

982
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:02,260
The Northern Lights are actually
a protective shield around the earth.

983
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,554
It protects all life forms…

984
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,391
from the dangers of the solar winds.

985
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,018
Cool.

986
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,313
Almost like being insured.

987
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,940
You and your insurance.

988
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,112
If you'd like,
you can be my Northern Lights…

989
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,200
until the end.

990
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,161
You mean that?

991
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,288
You're serious?

992
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,098
[sighs]

993
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,628
You know, if Ki-jun ever had plans
to develop a new product…

994
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,799
For example, your idea
to do space travel insurance.

995
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,219
Just go all in and don't back down.

996
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,388
Don't be a wuss.

997
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,849
[chuckles]

998
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,310
[sighs]

999
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,064
Or I might do it in Singapore.

1000
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,233
And spearhead your product over there.

1001
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,319
You'd really do that?

1002
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:47,699
Yeah.

1003
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,124
Hmm.

1004
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,628
[sighs]

1005
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,505
Actually…

1006
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:07,510
I know what I'm gonna do.

1007
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,543
Believe me,
I really was trying to tell you.

1008
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,464
[sighs]

1009
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:48,009
[romantic music playing]

1010
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,449
This feels a bit like…

1011
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,578
finally spotting the light
at the end of a very dark tunnel,

1012
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,997
that I mistook for a cave, you know.

1013
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:20,083
Isn't that what I said?

1014
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,418
-Oh, it was you.
-[chuckles]

1015
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,963
So, what happened?
Did you make it out of the tunnel?

1016
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,883
Hmm. Yeah, I suppose I did.

1017
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,885
I wanna go stargazing with you again.

1018
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,303
Mm-hmm.

1019
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,349
[sighs]

1020
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,394
-I have a question for you.
-Hmm?

1021
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,520
What is it?

1022
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,771
You know, the tarot?

1023
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,690
I wanna know what you asked.

1024
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,024
Oh.

1025
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,281
Well, I guess the tarot cards
were right, huh?

1026
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:54,701
They predicted we'd be successful.

1027
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,203
I had a different question in mind.

1028
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:58,287
Huh?

1029
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,123
You had a different question?

1030
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,333
So what question was that?

1031
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,460
Um, it's a secret.

1032
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:07,213
-[scoffs] Cruel.
-[chuckles]

1033
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,882
I will tell you
once the results are in. Yeah?

1034
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:11,050
Cruel…

1035
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:14,053
Scratch that.
If it's a positive result, I'll tell you.

1036
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,100
Am I gonna meet my twin flame
in this life? That's the question.

1037
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:21,644
"Twin flame"?

1038
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:26,149
A twin flame, in essence,
is two halves of one soul.

1039
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:31,028
They say humans originally had four arms,
four legs, and two faces,

1040
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:33,531
but the Gods felt threatened,
and so they separated them.

1041
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,907
Oh.

1042
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:38,453
So, what you're saying is there's someone
out there whose soul mirrors mine?

1043
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,915
They say by meeting this person,
you're not just beginning a new romance.

1044
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:45,126
It's a whole new chapter in your life.

1045
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,754
But, finding them,
that's where it gets difficult.

1046
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,006
How do you know you found them?

1047
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,135
I think it just feels
as if you've known them forever.

1048
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,261
Mmm.

1049
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,889
I recall that tarot reading…

1050
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,933
confirming that you would succeed.

1051
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:03,060
You recalled right.

1052
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,646
So, what's the verdict?

1053
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,857
Did you do it? Did you succeed?

1054
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,111
Did you get what you wanted?

1055
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,322
[chuckles]

1056
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,870
[chuckles]

1057
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:24,040
So that's when you knew.

1058
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:26,292
When you were calling future Han-deul,

1059
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,504
and you were asking her
how things would turn out.

1060
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:30,922
Your smile was just like it is now.

1061
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,173
You remember that?

1062
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,425
[chuckles] Mm-hmm.

1063
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:36,928
Noh Ki-jun.

1064
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:39,514
Remember today.

1065
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,140
[chuckles]

1066
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,773
Of course I do. How could I forget?

1067
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,026
Honestly, I'm a bit upset now.

1068
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:55,947
I knew right away.

1069
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,573
Really? Did you?

1070
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,700
You mean since the mattress adventure?

1071
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:00,910
Not that.

1072
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,788
When I saw you at the store.

1073
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,792
[romantic music playing]

1074
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,393
[panting]

1075
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,776
-Mr. Noh? What…
-[Ki-jun breathing heavily]

1076
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,696
Let's go.

1077
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,919
-[gasps]
-[screams]

1078
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:09,854
Excuse me.

1079
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,525
[romantic music continues]

1080
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,872
Okay. All right then.

1081
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,583
Hmm.

1082
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,087
Which one of you… Uh…

1083
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,255
Okay.

1084
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,341
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe. I choose you

1085
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,635
[chuckles]

1086
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,012
[sighs]

1087
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,139
Don't let me down.

1088
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,601
[Verdi's Requiem "Dies irae" playing]

1089
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,670
I basically have this memorized now.

1090
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,923
[Dae-bok shouting]

1091
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,300
It happened! It happened! We did it!

1092
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:06,262
-Wait, wait. What happened--
-We got our first contract!

1093
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,471
-What?
-[gasps]

1094
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:09,015
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

1095
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:10,683
-So soon?
-Who's the client?

1096
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,018
It's the president's daughter!

1097
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:13,811
[Jeon-man] Oh, her!

1098
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,980
The one who's gonna end things
any day now?

1099
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:19,525
That's her. She signed off
like it was nothing. It's a done deal.

1100
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,529
Now what'll happen is, the president
will speak about our product to everybody.

1101
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,906
-[laughs]
-Whoa!

1102
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,324
-This is great!
-Whoo!

1103
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,576
-[laughs]
-[all cheering]

1104
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,660
What an amazing start!

1105
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:32,121
[gasps] Oh, this is crazy!

1106
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,539
-[all laughing]
-Have a good trip?

1107
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:35,166
Help him up.

1108
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:36,917
IS YOUR MARRIAGE OKAY?

1109
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,252
[Chang-hee] You're married?
You look single.

1110
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,087
Well, I'm sure
getting married wasn't easy.

1111
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,131
But when you divorce
what happens to the house?

1112
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,342
There's child support, alimony,
divorce fees.

1113
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,304
So, divorce is much more challenging
than marriage.

1114
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,015
And that's where this insurance
will help you.

1115
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,558
But what if there's no divorce?

1116
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,268
You can always get a refund.

1117
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,063
Divorce insurance helps
in more ways than one.

1118
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,356
It helps to establish trust,

1119
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,068
and adds a layer
of prudence to the relationship.

1120
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,569
-It does make sense.
-Mm-hmm.

1121
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,821
Now then, are you interested?

1122
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:09,241
[CEO] The divorce insurance
really took a load off my shoulders.

1123
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,368
-Well done.
-Of course, sir.

1124
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,912
I've got my team to thank for it all.

1125
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,663
I might have to send them more projects.

1126
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,499
-So, your flight leaves soon?
-Yes.

1127
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,084
I'll drop by when I'm back in Korea.

1128
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,169
I'll talk to you soon, sir.

1129

-[heartbeat thumping]
-[romantic music playing]

1130
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:09,844
I'm not too late?

1131
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,012
[exhales]

1132
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,892
Does it amuse you
to make a fool out of me?

1133
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:19,603
It's just… [sighs]

1134
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:23,149
I wasn't sure how to tell you.
The timing just…

1135
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,901
[romantic music playing]

1136
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,999
[Na-rae] About, uh…

1137
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:42,543
our accommodations in Singapore--

1138
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,752
Let's live separately.

1139
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,923
'Cause we need our own space.

1140
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,136
You see?

1141
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,638
Great minds think alike.

1142
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,641
Let's go, we're running late.

1143
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,523
[upbeat music playing]

1144
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,737
[Ki-jun] There are countless
insurance policies in this world.

1145
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,572
STORM AND FLOOD

1146
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:01,038
-Yet, none…
-[tires screeching]

1147
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,749
…that prepare you for divorce.

1148
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,709
But now you are covered.

1149
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,837

"Plus General Insurance's

1155
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,522
Wow. We really did something there, huh?

1156
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,524
Well, yeah, of course.
I mean look who created it.

1157
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,025
Not too bad, huh? Come on.

1158
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,735
Not too bad's an understatement.

1159
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,237
Not the insurance, this here.

1160
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,574
Oh, you did really good. [laughs]

1161
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:39,618
-You're a bad liar.
-[chuckles]

1162
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,413
What are your thoughts
on the official launch, ma'am?

1163
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,123
It's over now and I'm sad.

1164
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:48,794
Even though it's exciting
to look ahead at what's next.

1165
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,421
What're you excited about?

1166
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,090
Feeling uncertain about what's next,
you know?

1167
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,174
To not be sure.

1168
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,678
Have you thought any more about
pride insurance?

1169
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,305
Do you still wanna create it?

1170
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:02,224
-Oh, yeah. For sure, I do.
-Then maybe try.

1171
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,268
[inhales sharply] You know, I'm not sure…

1172
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,603
[sighs] …if it's gonna work.

1173
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:09,773
We made it work with divorce, and
everybody wants to protect their pride.

1174
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:14,320
So, if the highly capable Ms. Kang
is doing it, then I'm gonna back it.

1175
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,961
Mr. Noh, we will give it our best shot.

1176
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,340
-Absolutely.
-[chuckles]

1177
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,644
You know, I wonder how things
are going with Na-rae and Mr. An.

1178
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,355
[Ki-jun] Oh, they're doing really well.

1179
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,775
I mean, Jeon-man isn't really the type
to share too many details, you know?

1180
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,485
-[Han-deul] Ah.
-"Na-rae"?

1181
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,611
[Han-deul] Hmm?

1182
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,446
[Ki-jun] Since when are you two so close?

1183
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,823
[Han-deul]
Let's just call it a secret between women.

1184
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:01,533
[Ki-jun] Ah, I get it.

1185
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,327
-Speaking of…
-Yeah?

1186
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,954
When are we gonna stop being so formal
with each other?

1187
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,083
[Han-deul] Well, uh, how about right now?

1188
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,794
-[Ki-jun] Okay.
-Okay.

1189
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,837
-[chuckles]
-[Ki-jun] Sure.

1190
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,517
[electronic voice] All right. Let's begin.

1191
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,852
What are the most important needs

1192
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:32,064
for a middle-aged person
to keep their marriage alive?

1193
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:34,650
Answer is four.

1194
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,734
(4) MY SPOUSE BESIDE ME

Being together with my stunning lady.

1196
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:42,866
Which of the following would you consider
to be most crucial for your own happiness?

1197
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,496
Number five, other. They all apply.

1198
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,375
Please select the advice you would give
to someone

1199
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,877
contemplating divorce or remarriage.

1200
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,091
Number four. All you need sometimes
is a bit of an adventure.

1201
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:02,803
Which of the following is true
of your decision to remarry?

1202
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,557
Well, I can't choose a pet rock,

1203
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:08,976
so one.

1204
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,185
(1) LIFE COMPANION

1205
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:13,605
What in your life has changed the most
since your divorce?

1206
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,818
Number three. The courage to start…

1207
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,571
all over again.

1208
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:24,074
What do you think helped you most
in overcoming your trauma?

1209
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,537
It's number two.
Letting go of regret from now on.

1210
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,331
Let's move on to the next question.

1211
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,626
Are you happy right now in your life?

A hit insurance product.
