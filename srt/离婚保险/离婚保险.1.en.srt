Honey, we've been here

00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:49,314
Come on. Let's do one final check.

20
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,316
We're done. What else is there to check?

21
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,276
- We did absolutely everything!
- Geez!

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,362
It doesn't feel right.
Something's missing.

23
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,739
What do you mean?

24
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:01,117
There's something else we need
when it comes to wedding preparations.

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,621

00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:16,466
I said divorce preparations.

29
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,140
Everyone says

30
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,268
to accept your fate
and to love your partner.

31
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,353
However…

32
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:32,857
Tell them to cut the crap.

33
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,400
- Is he crazy?
- What in the world?

34
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,944
Can you believe what he said?

35
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:37,737
It's easier said than done.

36
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:41,407
In case you're faced
with an unexpected divorce,

37
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:44,369

44
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,309
Any Korean citizen

45
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:11,437
may purchase divorce insurance
regardless of their marital status.

46
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,440
So long as they are
not currently having an affair,

47
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,150
they can be single,
married, re-married, or divorced.

48
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:18,236
This policy will cover
both living expenses

49
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,573
and court-mandated alimony payments

50
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:23,283
after the divorce.

51
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:27,245
Are you crazy? You're suggesting divorce
to couples who are about to get married?

- How can you say that?
- He's crazy.

55
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:39,048
Does life insurance encourage one's death?

56
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:42,218

encourage car accidents?

Everyone dreams

I get it because I felt the same way.

66
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:18,087
But if you've never paid alimony,
you can't possibly understand.

67
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,672
You become broke overnight.

68
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,801
And that's not all.
All your efforts are gone in an instant.

69
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:27,180
Do you know how much it costs
to rebuild your life?

70
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:28,389
Divorce costs just as much…

71
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:30,308
No, divorce costs more than marriage.

72
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,393
Divorce is more complicated
than marriage too.

73
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,938
Divorce is far more distressing

74
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,440
than any illness or accident.

75
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,735

EPISODE 1

84
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:38,418
We tried to sell divorce insurance
at a wedding fair.

85
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,129
I think we made a mistake.

86
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:42,964
People were afraid to admit it.

87
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:46,050
I bet they all secretly wanted
to take out a policy.

88
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,427
You need more sense knocked into you.

89
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,303
In any case, it's all our fault.

90
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:50,930
Technically, it's not "our" fault.

91
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:52,890
It's "someone's" fault.

92
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,226
Didn't I warn you?

93
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,354
Didn't I say a worst-case risk scenario
would happen?

94
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:03,609
It's not like we didn't
expect this at all.

95
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:04,652
Sir.

96
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:07,655
We had to push hard
to prove the lowest risk

97
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,490
in a worst-case scenario.

98
00:05:09,574 --> 00:05:12,410
But there's such a thing
as safety standards.

99
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:14,120
Mr. Noh Ki-jun, the actuary.

100
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:17,331
Your obsession with safety
is why we never get anywhere.

101
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,667
Mr. An Wuss-man, the risk surveyor.

102
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,169
Stop calling me Wuss-man.

103
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:24,714
I can't call a wuss Mr. Brave-man, can I?

104
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,132
Hey!

105
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,387
You're not an actuary. You're a travesty.

106
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:34,432
You're not a risk surveyor.
You have risk-phobia.

107
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:38,644
I'm rubber, you're glue.

108
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:39,729
- What? I can't hear you.
- I'm rubber, you're glue.

109
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:40,897
Excuse me!

110
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:46,152
I'm here to talk about divorce insurance.

111
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,991
I couldn't ask earlier
because there were too many people.

112
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:55,286
So…

113
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,707
You said wedding prep and divorce prep
go hand in hand, right?

114
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,752
It sounds like you're saying that marriage

115
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,462
ultimately leads to unhappiness, right?

116
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:05,546
No.

117
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,672
No?

118
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,133
I meant the exact opposite.

119
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,301
Come on.

120
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:13,304
Don't you mean that marriage and divorce
are exact opposites?

121
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,515
No. Marriage and divorce are the same.

122
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,519
They're the same?

123
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:22,063
The purpose of both marriage and divorce…

124
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:25,775
is to find happiness.

I said stick to selling
our current products.

132
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,982
Why did you have to create
an "innovative" product?

133
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:08,109
Why?

134
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:12,613
As long as the world's greatest actuary,
Noh Ki-jun, is still here,

135

the New Product Development Team

Every product you create
ends up in the red and is discontinued!

137
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,414
How will you save us
when everything has failed?

138
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,249
There's something out there!

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,044
I'll create an insurance product
that's never been seen before!

140
00:07:27,128 --> 00:07:28,171
Why? To fail again?

141
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:29,380
I won't fail anymore.

142
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,425
I'm telling you, I can do this!

What happened to the successful Noh Ki-jun

144
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:38,014
who used to create
one hit product after another?

145
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,766
Now he's just after
some innovative product…

146
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,101
I can't do this anymore.

147
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,270
Let's just die together.

00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,029
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

182
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:02,575
<i>What's this fixed credit card charge
of 29,900 won?</i>

183
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,535
Oh, that's just…

184
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,413
It's the fishing TV channel
subscription fee.

185
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:08,831
<i>Fishing TV?</i>

186
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:10,333
<i>Aren't you already a subscriber?</i>

187
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,669
Right, I meant to say Go TV.

188
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:15,504
It's about a contract.

189
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:18,549
<i>Oh, you idiot.
You took out another policy, didn't you?</i>

190
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,967
- No, I--
- <i>What is it this time?</i>

191
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,719
Honey, the thing is…

192
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:24,013
Remember when I was an agent
at the Ssangmun branch

193
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,848
and worked with a guy named Chang-hee?

194
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:26,932
So Chang-hee--

195
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,185
<i>Will you take out loans
to pay your premiums now?</i>

196
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,853
<i>Do you know your entire salary
goes into that?</i>

197
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:31,937
Of course, I do.

198
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:35,066
But, honey, you know how insurance works.

199
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,527
- <i>If we get sick later--</i>
- Let's get a divorce.

200
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,112
What? A divorce?

201
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,530
Hello?

202
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,827
Hey, what's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

203
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,246
I left you some <i>gomguk</i> soup
on the dining table

204
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,790
as well as divorce papers.

205
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,126
- I'm leaving.
- <i>Honey?</i>

206
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,462
So-jeong? Lee So-jeong?

APPLICATION ON THE CONFIRMATION
OF DIVORCE BY CONSENT

208
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,721
Hello? Honey?

209
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,264
Honey?

210
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,104
Did you hang up?

211
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,948
You made curry for me, too, right?

212
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:26,951
Mr. Na!

213
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,709
- Divorce, sir.
- What?

214
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:37,878
Let's create divorce insurance.

215
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,256
What's that? I have no idea what you mean.

216
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:45,678
Nothing poses a bigger risk
these days than divorce.

217
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:49,056
Remember the rock-tripping insurance
and nosedive insurance you created?

218
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,684
Don't you remember how they failed?
Do you want to repeat that?

219
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,478
<i>We're the only two left in this team.</i>

220
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,021
<i>What can the two of us do?</i>

221
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:59,024
If we fail again, we'll get fired.
We'll be done for.

222
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:00,734
Right. Okay.

223
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:04,071
Mr. Na, imagine that you got divorced.

224
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,573
Is that supposed to be funny?

225
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,074
Oh, wait.

226
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,871
Okay. Now just imagine this.

227
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:16,000
I got divorced.

228
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,835
"I got divorced."

229
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:19,336
I got divorced.

230
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,880
"I got divorced."

231
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,006
I got

232
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:24,675
divorced.

233
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,427
Geez!

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,554

No!

243
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:05,549
You get it, right?

244
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,760
Divorce is an actual disaster.

245
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:12,723
But…

246
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,060
Can we actually calculate
the risk of divorce?

247
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:23,484
They do it for death.
Think of life insurance.

248
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,736
You're right, but…

249
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:28,697
Okay, look.

250
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:31,492
We can calculate the insurance rates

251
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:35,079
based on the presence of rational factors
that indicate a lasting marriage

252
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,998
or irrational factors leading
to a failed marriage.

253
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,382
Can you have the calculations ready
by the next meeting?

254
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:55,224
Divorce can be covered by insurance, sir!

255
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,272
Make it happen.

256
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,323
Make it happen.

257
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:51,155
I'm sorry. I forgot that I'm single now.

258
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,282
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:54,742
I'm so sorry.

260
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,917
I'm divorced now.

261
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:20,142
Tuna…

262
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:22,645
Tuna…

263
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:38,243
This goes here.

265
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:17,199
Ma'am, we're closing the register soon.

266
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:18,867
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:28,752
Is this it?

268
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:29,837
Excuse me?

269
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:35,634
Yes.

These are the annual disaster cases
based on last year's data.

274
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:03,639
If you take a look
at the bottom of this list,

275
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:07,392
this disaster alone
accounts for 92,400 cases.

276
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,769
What do you think it is?

277
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:10,979
Aren't fires
the most common accident type?

278
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:14,358
But fire cases are already listed.
What could it be then?

279
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:16,902
The answer is…

280
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,029
NUMBER OF DIVORCE CASES

281
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:20,572
…divorce.

282
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:27,287
Isn't it a bit much
to classify divorce as a disaster?

283
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:30,123
Unexpected catastrophes and hardships

284
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,084
are what we call disasters.

285
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,921
These are the changes
that appear post-divorce.

286
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,798
You suddenly experience
financial difficulty.

287
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,842
Your living environment suddenly changes.

288
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:42,261
Your relationships change drastically.

289
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:44,763
And your mental health suffers.

290
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:48,392
How are any of these things
different from disasters?

291
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,728
Then I suppose divorce is a disaster
that could never happen to me

292
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:54,565
because I don't believe
in marriage to begin with.

293
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:58,986
Being single doesn't mean
you're not affected.

294
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,112
Your parents' divorce.

295
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:01,947
Your siblings' divorces.

296
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,073
Your children's divorces.

297
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,158
Even your friends' divorces.

298
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:08,495
There are divorces all around you
that can impact your life.

299
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,373
I have to admit it was hard
dealing with my parents' divorce.

300
00:19:11,456 --> 00:19:13,667
My daughter got divorced recently

301
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,545
and moved back home with the kids,
so it's been stressful.

302
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:20,299
If we create a model assessing
financial and emotional damages

303
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,009
following a divorce,

304
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,803
we can break down
the various damages, including alimony,

305
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,347
and calculate the coverage amount.

306
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:37,065
Divorce happens by choice, not by chance.

307
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:40,736
Therefore, it doesn't qualify
for insurance coverage.

308
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,280
I think you're referring
to the issue of moral hazard.

309
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:45,490
By adjusting the premiums
based on the policy period,

310
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:47,034
we can prevent incurring losses.

311
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,994
To determine whether any losses may occur,

312
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:51,914
we'll need to conduct sample testing
to verify the accuracy

313
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:54,458
of the calculation model
and value liabilities

314
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,044
to confirm whether or not it is safe.

315
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,299
I think you're saying we need to review

316
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:05,218
the solvency adequacy model
to determine whether this is good or bad.

317
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,095
If that's what you need, I'll set it up.

318
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:11,141
Please assemble a task force.

319
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,523
- What is he talking about?
- Seriously?

320
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:28,075
You told me to make it happen!

321
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,001
How long will you eat <i>gomguk</i> soup?

322
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,505
Just how long will you keep eating curry?

323
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,424
Namaste.

324
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:48,470
Please, sir.

325
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:00,774
Assemble a task force.

326
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,734
- I'll take full responsibility.
- Yes!

327
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:10,867
THANK YOU

328
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:12,077
Thank you.

You annoying bastard.

332
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:37,728
Really?

333
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:38,937
Then we must've gotten divorced.

334
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:46,737
Be honest with me.
You're into the divorce insurance idea.

335
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,697
What? Get out of my way.

336
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:55,495
Look at the back of his head twitching.

337
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,997
He's definitely interested.

338
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:01,251
CLEANING SUPPLY BOX

339
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:20,979
Get that out of my face.

340
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:25,275
Just come clean.

341
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:27,027
You don't speak up in meetings.

342
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,612
But you did today,
so you're 100% interested.

343
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:29,905
- You're wrong.
- Why?

344
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:31,448
Jumping in the deep end isn't safe.

345
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:34,826
You really do live up
to your name, An Jeon-man.

346
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,870
And you live up to your own
by having no standards.

347
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,626
Just think about it.
You and I both did it.

348
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:43,752
I even did it three times.

349
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:45,921
That's four divorces between us two,
which equals a 200% chance.

350
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:47,881
You're betting on a 200% probability.

351
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:49,758
There's no safer bet than this,
An Jeon-man.

352
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,218
Hey, Noh Ki-jun.

353
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,220
Why did you get married three times?

354
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:54,679
Why create a 200% probability?

355
00:22:55,347 --> 00:22:56,348
Why?

356
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:58,517
I…

357
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,690
can't do one-night stands.

358
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:17,744
I'm going to create

359
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:19,704
divorce insurance.

360
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,250
Does that mean…

361
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,503
You only slept with three women?

362
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:30,465
If you're recruiting me,
treat me to <i>hanwoo</i> BBQ!

363
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,093
I want tenderloin!

364
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,266
This goes to the ladder truck.

365
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:27,189
- Just wait a bit until we're done.
- Okay.

366
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:29,524
This goes to the ladder truck.
One, two, three!

367
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,198
I'm sorry, but we have to move the sofa.

368
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,911
Over here. Please grab the sofa.

369
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:42,704
On three.

370
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:44,206
One, two, three!

371
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:51,213
Why is this covered?

372
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:54,382
I told them to just scratch up the floor.

373
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,093
Hey, be careful with that. It's expensive.

374
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:00,889
- Here we go.
- Hey!

375
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,849
Just leave that here.

376
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,392
- I took the frame already.
- Just leave it?

377
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,602
It's heavy. Throw it away.

378
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:07,854
Let's wrap it up.

379
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,190
I took that too.

380
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,735
Hey.

381
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,030
I lost a screw while removing the bidet.

382
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:19,449
Make sure to find it
and send it to me, okay?

383
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:23,453
Are you deaf? Did you hear what I said?

384
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:26,122
What about this house?

385
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,250
Keep it as alimony.

386
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,169
It's under your name anyway.

387
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:33,213
All that's left of this house is debt.

388
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:36,216
We took out high-interest loans
to open your café.

389
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,261
I know that's why the house
was put under my name.

390
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:42,347
Why are you coming after me
about your loans?

391
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:46,351
- What?
- You bitched about wanting a divorce.

392
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:48,186
Damn it, this is ridiculous.

393
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:57,696
Whatever. Just pay back the money
you borrowed from my mom.

394
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,572
What money? I don't have any.

395
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:01,449
What?

396
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:04,286
You said to pay it back whenever I could.

397
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:08,456
Geez. Going back on your word
runs in your family.

398
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,582
- Right?
- What?

399
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,127
I'll pay you back later.

400
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,586
We're good now, right?

401
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,797
Don't act all invasive later.

402
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,881
I'm warning you.

403
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,175
Damn it.

404
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:29,185
It's "evasive."

405
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,439
It's evasive, not invasive.

406
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:36,067
It comes from "to evade" or "to escape."

407
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,320
It's "evasive."

408
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:44,659
This is why you're a failure.

409
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:47,412
Who cares if it's invasive or evasive?

410
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:49,372
Why is an idiot like you so nitpicky?

411
00:26:49,456 --> 00:26:51,041
Just find the screw and send it to me!

412
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:53,126
I can't use this bidet without it.

413
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,968
NOH KI-JUN

414
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:49,808
Come on. Let's focus.

415
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:53,978
I'm a genius actuary.

416
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:02,362
[TABLE 22] NUMBER OF DIVORCES
BY DURATION OF MARRIAGE AND…

417
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,384
I can do this.

418
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:29,556
STOCK PRICE

419
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:42,444
Let's go eat.

420
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,161
FIERY HOT BBQ RIBS

421
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:00,753
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

422
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:04,966
I got you tenderloin, so you're in, okay?

423
00:29:05,592 --> 00:29:07,343
Tenderloin won't be enough.

424
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:10,346
What else do you want
other than tenderloin?

425
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,056
- I need to be informed.
- What?

426
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,809
- Inform me.
- About what?

427
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:18,438
- About why you got divorced.
- Geez, way to ruin the mood.

428
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:21,858
I need details
on a high-risk case like you

429
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:25,153
to decide whether or not
I should join this project.

430
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:32,827
This project is doomed
if you try to trick me into it.

431
00:29:36,956 --> 00:29:39,042
I'm an old friend,
but you still hide this from me.

432
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,878
So why would anyone open up
about this stuff to you?

433
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:43,004
Just forget it.

434
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,382
If I tell you, you're joining.

435
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,301
Sure thing.

436
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,011
Start me off.

437
00:29:50,094 --> 00:29:51,638
First wife.

438
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:54,557
We had different views on marriage.

439
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:55,767
Second wife.

440
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:58,770
We had different worldviews.

441
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:00,813
Third wife.

442
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:02,941
We had different views on life.

443
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,696
Views on marriage, worldviews,
and views on life?

444
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,032
- Are you trying to crack me up?
- No, I'm cracking open soju.

445
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:14,202
Don't be ridiculous.

446
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:15,912
How were your marriage views different?

447
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:17,872
Did she want an open marriage
or something?

448
00:30:18,373 --> 00:30:19,374
Yes.

449
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:30,218
Geez. What is this, Hollywood?

450
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:34,931
- Now it's your turn.
- What do you mean?

451
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:36,599
The reason why you got divorced.

452
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:39,727
I have nothing to divulge
because I'm not buying divorce insurance.

453
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:41,187
I'm asking you as a friend.

454
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:44,148
We're best friends, after all.

455
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,575
I was just curious.

456
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:56,494
Why would a responsible guy
like you get divorced?

457
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:08,548
My wife was an interior design fanatic.

458
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:10,633
And?

459
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:13,177
One day, she told me something was
ruining the look of her place.

460
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:14,637
Like what?

461
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:17,390
Me.

462
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:23,146
So what did you do?

463
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:24,897
I left the house.

464
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:27,358
Geez, you're such a fool.

465
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:29,402
All you do is run away
instead of fighting back.

466
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:32,614
You haven't changed a bit
since you were a kid.

467
00:31:32,697 --> 00:31:34,324
You're the bigger fool.

468
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:38,411
If you're so smart,
how come you paid alimony three times?

469
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:42,915
Forget it.

470
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,512
Han-deul!

471
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:11,265
Hey, Ah-young!

472
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:13,726
Over here, Ah-young!

473
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,897
This won't do.

474
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:21,567
- Han-deul.
- Yes?

475
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,277
- I'm holding a sologamy.
- A sologamy?

476
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:25,446
Yes. I have no intention
of getting married.

477
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:28,824
If you don't want to get married,
then just don't.

478
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:29,951
Why hold a sologamy?

479
00:32:30,034 --> 00:32:33,412
I gave out so much wedding gift money.
I need to make it all back.

480
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,538
I see.

481
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:44,048
Wedding gift money is
legally considered a gift.

482
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,133
I'm under no obligation to return a gift

483
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:47,510
even if the other party requests it.

484
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:51,055
So I'm going to hold a sologamy
and get my wedding gift money back.

485
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:53,599
Spoken like a true loss adjuster.

486
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:55,977
I'm always taking a loss because
I worry about what others think.

487
00:33:00,106 --> 00:33:03,025
Maybe I aim under
because I'm an underwriter.

488
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,960
Geez, that scared me.

489
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:23,379
That hurts.

490
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,388
So not only did that bastard cheat on you,
he took the bidet too?

491
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,681
What were you doing all this time?

492
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:38,477
Forget it. Let him have it.

493
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:41,439
What do you mean forget it?
You're too nice for your own good.

494
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,566
That's why you keep taking losses.

495
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:47,528
Geez, I'm so pissed.

496
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,412
- Han-deul.
- What?

497
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,414
You're starting work
at my company next week, right?

498
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,958
- Yes.
- And I'm the only one you know there?

499
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,668
Yes, I guess so.

500
00:34:04,462 --> 00:34:05,463
Then how about you do this?

501
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,547
Do what?

502
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,383
Now that you're switching jobs,
get rid of your nice image

503
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:10,801
and start fresh as a smiley nutcase

504
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:12,219
A smiley nutcase?

505
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:14,930
A nutcase who says whatever they want
with a big smile!

506
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,226
A NUTCASE WHO SAYS WHATEVER
THEY WANT WITH A BIG SMILE

507
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:29,904
I like it!

508
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,741
But how do I become one?

509
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,827
I'll spread some rumors for you at work.

510
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:40,122
The new Joeun Fire Insurance underwriter
is a smiley nutcase.

511
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:41,373
Have you heard?

512
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:42,875
The new underwriter

513
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,336
is supposedly a smiley nutcase.

514
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,046
Smiley nutcase.

515
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,506
<i>What do you think?</i>

516
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,967
So I should just start off
as a smiley nutcase?

517
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:54,428
Exactly. Then nobody will mess with you.

518
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,432
I love it.

519
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,893
You're a genius!

520
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,356
Trust me. I'll turn you
into a real smiley nutcase.

521
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,191
Thanks, Ah-young!

522
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,570
Look, fire!

523
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:15,741
I'm a smiley nutcase!

524
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:17,660
I'm a smiley nutcase!

525
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:23,415
<i>-Behold, at the foot of Cheonma Mountain

00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,972
Oh, my!

534
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,316
What the heck?

535
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:01,031
- Hey, who are you?
- What are you doing?

536
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,667
Oh, my goodness. What are they doing?

537
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,920
- Hey, stop that!
- Who are you?

538
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,350
FAIR AND HONEST POLICE
SERVING THE PEOPLE

539
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:29,685
Come on now.

540
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:32,563
It's late, and you two seem
like respectable people.

541
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,815
The neighborhood is in an uproar.

542
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,026
Make peace with each other.

543
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:39,445
I was on my way home from work when…

544
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:41,905
Geez, my finger hurts.

545
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:46,744
So on my way home,
I saw a mattress moving along by itself.

546
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,579
Imagine how weird that must have looked.

547
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,914
So I approached it to get a better look

548
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,750
when this woman popped out from under it.

549
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,461
She grabbed my finger,
and we both fell over.

550
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,755
So naturally, my body followed
in that direction.

551
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:58,922
That's why…

552
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:02,134
Geez, that's how it happened.

553
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,678
Sir, that's not what happened.

554
00:39:04,762 --> 00:39:07,765
I was just trying to throw away a mattress

555
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:10,225
when this man suddenly appeared.

556
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,895
He pounced on me
and then on top of the mattress,

557
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,438
- he did this thing--
- That's not true!

558
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,190
I didn't pounce on you!

559
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,150
You grabbed my finger and pulled me down.

560
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,527
I couldn't help but fall down with it.
Don't you agree?

561
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,197
It just happened naturally,
so it couldn't be helped.

562
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,407
Who are you accusing of pouncing on you?

563
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:28,243
Do you have any idea how badly
my molar and jaw hurt right now?

564
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:29,745
Your molar?

565
00:39:29,828 --> 00:39:32,164
Excuse me, do you think
molars crack that easily?

566
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,624
Your front teeth might,

567
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,210
but molars don't crack that easily.

568
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:38,879
Take a look.

569
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:41,548
Look. Do you see it?

570
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,633
You can't see it, can you?

571
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:45,886
Even dentists can't tell
if a tooth is cracked just by looking.

572
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,514
I didn't see any cracks,
but I saw plenty of cavities.

573
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:49,765
You should brush your teeth well.

574
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,227
You two are about to start again.
Please stop fighting.

575
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:57,064
Let's make this simple
and have your insurance take care of it.

576
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,526
Insurance doesn't cover things like this.

577
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:01,610
Why not?

578
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,570
My finger hurts as well as my jaw.

579
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:04,863
And my molar. Everything hurts.

580
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:08,534
Neither SO2.5 nor S62 apply in this case.

581
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,206
Wait. How do you know
all the diagnosis codes?

582
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,335
Are you a dentist?

583
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,843
What's your occupation?

584
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,971
I'm not a dentist.

585
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,975
Don't be so invasive when you answer.

586
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,101
Hold on.

587
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:38,021
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but it's "evasive," not "invasive."

588
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,819
It comes from "to evade" or "to escape,"

589
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,863
as in how one's thoughts can evade them.

590
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:48,532
The correct term is "evasive."

591
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,203
"Evasive."

592
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,747
- You're really nitpicky, sir.
- I know.

593
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:56,915
Thank you.

594
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,004
Why? What is it?

595
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:04,548
It's nothing.

596
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,246
Is she going to buy it or not?

597
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:39,875
I really want to eat that.

598
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:43,170
Excuse me.

599
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,940
Ma'am, we're closing the register soon.

600
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:05,484
I'm sorry.

601
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,736
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:17,204
She's just like someone I know.

603
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:34,846
Why? What is it?

604
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:36,848
It's nothing.

605
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,652
I'd like to apologize.

606
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:51,780
I apologize as your fellow neighbor.

607
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:53,782
I didn't mean to block your way.

608
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:55,033
Peace?

609
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,243
All of a sudden?

610
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,161
Let's just make up.

611
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,999
We made peace, so can we go now?

612
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,542
Let's pretend this never happened.

613
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,670
- What?
- Can we go?

614
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:09,756
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait a minute.

615
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,218
Why are you two leaving just like that?

616
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:18,932
Why does she remind me of someone?
It's messing with my head.

617
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,435
You should let go of my hand.

618
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:27,107
You're the one who suggested
we forget about this, okay?

619
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:30,527
I know. Just don't change your tune later.

620
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:31,987
Change my tune?

621
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:35,324
Whatever. Let's never cross paths again.

622
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,201
Again…

623
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,704
There's a higher probability of seeing

624
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,749
an albino raccoon
than running into you again.

625
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,084
Right.

626
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:47,502
Let's part ways now.

627
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:50,172
- Fine. Let's do that.
- Okay.

628
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:57,554
Damn it! We live in the same direction.

629
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,093
RECRUITMENT NOTICE

630
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:04,970
RECRUITMENT NOTICE

631
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:08,181
What is this for?

632
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,851
Are you going to do it?

633
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:12,519
How can anyone apply for this?

634
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,646
- Read this.
- This is crazy.

635
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,189
When are they recruiting?

636
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,903
What is this?

637
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:22,696
It says "divorce."

638
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:23,906
Hey.

639
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:25,949
Look at the preferred qualifications.
"At least one divorce."

640
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,326
QUALIFICATIONS
AT LEAST ONE DIVORCE EXPERIENCE

641
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:29,202
- Don't you qualify?
- You should try out.

642
00:44:30,954 --> 00:44:31,955
Noh Ki-jun!

643
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,959
Damn. This office is huge.

644
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:41,548
Hey, this must have cost a pretty penny.

645
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:45,844
Where's my desk? Where do I sit?

646
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:47,512
Look carefully.

647
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,308
It's way…

648
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:55,520
Way over there.

649
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:01,944
- <i>Your call cannot be connected.</i>
- Damn, I got sent to voicemail again.

650
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:08,492
The applicants…

651
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:12,371
The company put their trust in you
and assembled a task force.

652
00:45:12,454 --> 00:45:15,791
They even gave us this huge office.

653
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:18,710
If this tanks, we're all doomed.

654
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:20,212
Do you hear me?

655
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:21,713
The applicants!

656
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:22,923
What about the applicants?

657
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:25,425
Were you here the whole time?
Why didn't you answer?

658
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,552
What is it? What about the applicants?

659
00:45:53,078 --> 00:45:54,579
DIVORCE INSURANCE TASK FORCE
INTERVIEW IN PROGRESS

660
00:45:54,663 --> 00:45:55,956
What is your reason for applying?

661
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,126
I got divorced last year
but haven't been able to pay alimony yet.

662
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:02,879
- Can it apply retroactively?
- You've been married for ten years,

663
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:04,548
but you're interested
in divorce insurance.

664
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:07,259
I have a boyfriend, not a husband.

665
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:09,511
I want to get divorce insurance
before divorcing him.

666
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:12,347
Even if it was a common-law marriage,

667
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:14,558
it still counts as a divorce
if we split up, right?

668
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:17,060
We'll have to review those situations too.

669
00:46:19,938 --> 00:46:22,899
Good job. Thank you for coming.

670
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,151
Next.

671
00:46:24,943 --> 00:46:25,986
Just go.

672
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:27,112
Next, please.

673
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:30,115
- Thank you.
- Sure.

674
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,909
Next, please.

675
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,661
Next, please.

676
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:37,956
Hello.

677
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,082
Hello.

678
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:44,379
Ms. Joh Ah-young.

679
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:47,799
If I remember correctly,
didn't you say you were against marriage?

680
00:46:47,883 --> 00:46:49,009
That's right, sir.

681
00:46:49,092 --> 00:46:51,136
So why do you want
divorce insurance coverage?

682
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:52,220
Oh, right.

683
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:57,476
It's because I can divorce myself.

685
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:07,819
I'm not the only nutcase out there.

686
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:12,824
Yes, come in.

687
00:47:13,575 --> 00:47:14,701
Hello.

688
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:17,079
Come on in…

689
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:19,289
Ma'am?

690
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,257
Great outfit.

691

RESUME, KANG HAN-DEUL

692
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:45,190
I see you worked as an underwriter.

693
00:47:45,982 --> 00:47:47,109
I thought you were a dentist.

694
00:47:47,692 --> 00:47:51,154
You got divorced most recently
out of all of today's applicants.

695
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:53,990
So that's why…

696
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,618
That's why you were
throwing away that mattress.

697
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:59,412
I totally understand.

698
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,623
I've been divorced three times myself.

699
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:04,251
Why are you telling me that?

700
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:07,587
It's a sensitive topic,
so I wanted to put you at ease.

701
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,594
Right. Insurance is a sensitive topic.

702
00:48:14,678 --> 00:48:15,929
The coverage might be the same,

703
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:18,306
but it needs to be tailored
to each country's system.

704
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,058
Pet insurance has taken off in Europe,

705
00:48:20,142 --> 00:48:22,686
but not in our country
where there are ten million pet owners.

706
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,896
Insurance policies read like legal text.

707
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,274
And who knows how it will change
in this economic climate?

708
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:29,985
Mr. Actuary, what do you think
the chances are

709
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:31,653
of divorce insurance succeeding?

710
00:48:33,572 --> 00:48:36,283
What do you think, Ms. Underwriter?

711
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,578
They're as high as
a pure-white albino raccoon being born.

712
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:44,457
To pull off this 1 in 500,000 chance,

713
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:47,169
you'll need a skilled underwriter
like me on board.

714
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,192
Welcome to the team.

715
00:49:19,117 --> 00:49:20,827
I don't know if you've heard,

716
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:23,872
but I'm a smiley nutcase.

717
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:26,208
- What?
- If you'll excuse me…

718
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:32,339
Be careful!

719
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:43,058
Ki-jun!

720
00:49:43,141 --> 00:49:45,143
Ki-jun.

721
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:47,562
What the…

722
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:49,648
Hey, Ki-jun.

723
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:56,488
- Something big came up.
- What is it?

724
00:49:56,571 --> 00:49:59,157
The quant assigned
to the Singapore branch.

725
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:00,700
What about the quant?

726
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:03,995
They're joining this project
with executive vice president status.

727
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,126
Why is a quant in Singapore coming here
instead of going to Wall Street?

728
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,670
That's what I want to know.

729
00:50:14,756 --> 00:50:17,759
The CEO's daughter is getting divorced.

730
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:20,428
- What?
- So he says it's urgent.

731
00:50:20,512 --> 00:50:22,514
His daughter is about to fall apart.

732
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:25,225
Damn it.

733
00:50:25,308 --> 00:50:27,477
Hey, you can do this, right?

734
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,145
No, make it happen no matter what.

735
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:31,398
Our lives are at stake here.

736
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:35,568
Let's do this.

737
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,933
DIVORCE INSURANCE TASK FORCE

738
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:08,351
USE DATA TO MAKE SMART CHOICES

739
00:51:13,648 --> 00:51:16,484
All it took was one workshop,
and now you're all close.

740
00:51:16,568 --> 00:51:18,528
People might think you guys are a family.

741
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:24,617
I can't believe we have five team members.

742
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:28,413
It'll be six members
once the executive vice president arrives.

743
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:31,708
Six members! Can you believe it?

744
00:51:34,669 --> 00:51:39,424
Let's take a group photo at a studio
and hang it on the wall.

745
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:46,598
Hey, Ms. Kang.

746
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:49,642
You must be nervous
about your first project at our company.

747
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:50,977
Don't you worry.

748
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:54,314
We got your back, Ms. Kang.

749
00:51:56,524 --> 00:51:59,152
Mr. Na, Ms. Kang isn't a newbie.

750
00:51:59,235 --> 00:52:01,654
On top of that, she's a smiley nutcase.

751
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:05,784
- Oh, my.
- Right.

752
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:08,578
You didn't know?
Everyone in the company knows.

753
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:10,455
What does that mean?

754
00:52:10,538 --> 00:52:13,166
A nutcase who says
whatever they want with a big smile.

755
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:26,805
You should have hurried and got on.

756
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:32,060
But is that something to be happy about?

757
00:52:32,143 --> 00:52:33,520
Yes, sir.

758
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:37,440
Okay. In any case, let's give it our best.

759
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:38,691
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

760
00:52:40,402 --> 00:52:42,028
This isn't a big deal. Why am I nervous?

761
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:43,947
What about the quant from Singapore?

762
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:46,783
The executive vice president?
They're coming today.

763
00:52:46,866 --> 00:52:49,577
They flew in over the weekend
to join the project from the start.

764
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:51,955
- They sat in business class.
- I see.

765
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:55,792
Isn't a quant an investment analyst

766
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:58,503
who completely disregards human judgment

767
00:52:58,586 --> 00:53:01,798
and relies 100%
on quantitative computer analysis?

768
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:03,425
Am I right?

769
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:04,926
You know it.

770
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:07,846
But isn't a bit much to have a quant
in insurance product development?

771
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:16,604
That's what I'm saying.

772
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:25,363
It won't be long until computers
create insurance products.

773
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:26,990
At this rate, people will marry AI.

774
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:28,158
And get divorced from it.

775
00:53:39,043 --> 00:53:41,629
Isn't this elevator a little weird?

776
00:53:41,713 --> 00:53:44,174
- What?
- Why aren't we at the 12th floor yet?

777
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:47,802
Stick to the walls!

778
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:51,014
- Please stop!
- Don't move!

779
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:53,016
Someone help us!

780
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,809
Be quiet and calm down.

781
00:53:59,564 --> 00:54:00,732
Did you just…

782
00:54:01,232 --> 00:54:02,901
Damn it. What the heck?

783
00:54:05,153 --> 00:54:07,197
Damn it!

784
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,781
Did you pass gas, mister?

785
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:12,577
Don't call him mister.
He's still our team leader.

786
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,995
I'm so sorry.

787
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:15,955
I get gassy when I'm nervous.

788
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:17,624
- I'm sorry.
- Don't come near me.

789
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,932
It's an elevator demon!

790
00:54:42,398 --> 00:54:45,443
- Geez, my heart.
- The elevator stopped, so how did it open?

791
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:50,740
Oh, damn it.

792
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:53,785
We're on the first floor.

793
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:56,246
Nobody pressed the button?

794
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:58,414
You were right there!
Why didn't you press it?

795
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:01,251
- Why?
- I thought somebody else did.

796
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:08,132
Let's start off by pulling a list
based on profit projections and ROE.

797
00:55:08,716 --> 00:55:10,510
Let's have the quanty pull the data,

798
00:55:10,593 --> 00:55:13,596
and please put together a file
with standardized scores for analysis.

799
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,765
When it comes to factors,
the more, the better.

800
00:55:15,848 --> 00:55:18,893
A greater number of factors
leads to more possible strategies.

801
00:55:22,605 --> 00:55:24,983
I'm sorry, but who are you?

802
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:27,986
I'm Jeon Na-rae.

803
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:32,365
Jeon Na-rae?

804
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:39,581
You're the new executive vice president?

805
00:55:41,332 --> 00:55:42,333
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

806
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:44,210
Hello.

807
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:53,970
Do you two know each other?

808
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:58,266
I'm Mr. Noh Ki-jun's ex-wife.

809
00:55:58,349 --> 00:55:59,434
What?

810
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:03,521
No, she's not.

811
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,648
She's not my ex-wife.

812
00:56:07,942 --> 00:56:09,694
She's my ex-ex-ex wife.

813
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,076
- The one who flew in business class.
- Right.

827
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:41,452
I'd like to develop a big-data based
divorce prediction model.

828
00:57:41,536 --> 00:57:43,287
<i>But shouldn't we first convince people</i>

829
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:45,873
<i>that divorce is a type of risk</i>

830
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:47,875
that requires coverage?

831
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:50,920
<i>Is it just me,
or do you also feel some weird vibes?</i>

832
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:53,923
<i>If I could knit
a whole new life for myself,</i>

833
00:57:54,006 --> 00:57:55,508
I'd choose Ki-jun again.

834
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,969
<i>Will this get approved in the meeting?</i>

835
00:57:58,052 --> 00:57:59,929
It received conditional approval.

836
00:58:00,012 --> 00:58:02,432
<i>That's the condition? And not the goal?</i>

837
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:04,350
<i>Isn't that basically a safety net?</i>

838
00:58:04,434 --> 00:58:06,394
<i>Do you think we can do this?</i>
