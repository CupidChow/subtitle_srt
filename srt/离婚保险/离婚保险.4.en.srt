FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE

00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,927
-Move your car!
-Why are you getting off?

4
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:54,847
-Please move your car!
-What's the matter with you?

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,683
Come on.

6
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,729
Hurry.

7
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,500
Move your car!

8
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,212
-Why aren't you moving?
-Get out of the way.

9
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,964
Move already!

10
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:30,966
Let's go.

11
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,137
-Where are you going?
-You can't just leave your car!

12
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,890
I said move your car!

13
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,231
You're a smiley nutcase,
so put on a good smile.

14
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,623
I'm sorry, everyone.

15
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,335
You can't leave your car like that!

16
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,878
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

17
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,213
Thank you.

{\an8}EPISODE 4

19
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,908
{\an8}I haven't laughed that hard in a while.

20
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,910
{\an8}How did it feel
to be a true smiley nutcase?

21
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,078
{\an8}-Good, thanks to you.
-Don't mention it.

22
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,372
{\an8}Just a second.

23
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,754
{\an8}YOUR HAIR APPOINTMENT
HAS BEEN CANCELED

24
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,505
{\an8}It got canceled again.

25
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,050
{\an8}Do I have to go there myself?

26
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,097
{\an8}Ms. Kang, we'll have to part ways here.

27
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,098
Here?

28
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,142
Yes, I have to go see someone.

29
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,436
I'll have to head out first.

30
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,396
-Okay.
-Taxi!

31
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,159
I guess Ah-young was right
about him having a girlfriend.

32
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:12,878
Kang Han-deul?

33
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,216
Is that you, Jeong-sin?

34
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,098
Thank you.

35
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,227
I should be the one treating you.

36
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,854
You helped me out so much
when we were in university

37
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,815
and when I worked for you.

38
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,234
Not at all.

39
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,988
You were the smartest employee I had.

40
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:43,367
I heard the news,
and I've been meaning to buy you a meal.

41
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,745
I heard you got divorced.

42
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,248
Yes, that's right.

43
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,043
-Good for you.
-Excuse me?

44
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,547
There must be a good reason
why someone as sweet and shy as you

45
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,174
would get a divorce.

46
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:04,138
I've always thought it was a shame
how you let people walk all over you.

47
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,277
Getting divorced is
the best thing I've done recently.

48
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,575
I'm happy for you.

49
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,243
How are you these days?

50
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,621
I'm working at Plus General Insurance.

51
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,789
Really?

52
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,710
You should've taken some time off
after your divorce and gone traveling.

53
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,048
The product we're developing is unique,
so work is good.

54
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,549
What kind of product is it?

55
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,095
Divorce insurance.

56
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,516
The insurance sold at that wedding fair?

57
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,770
That was your team's idea?

58
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,147
Yes. It seems you already know about it.

59
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,316
I found it rather interesting.

60
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,567
Right?

61
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,987
You must be busy preparing
for the official launch.

62
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,448
I hope I'm not taking up
too much of your time.

63
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,824
Not at all.

64
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,952
It's chaotic, but it's fun.

65
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,789
My team works well together
because they're great at what they do.

66
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,333
Is that so?

67
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,002
Aren't you the one who's busy, Jeong-sin?

68
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,296
I'm okay.

69
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,509
Launching this for the first time in Korea
will involve some risks,

70
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,512
but with a skilled underwriter
like you on the team…

71
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,848
I guess it'll be fine.

72
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,016
Excuse me?

73
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,227
Never mind.

74
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,646
I think divorce insurance
will be a huge success.

75
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,232
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

76
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,819
Let's go ahead and eat.

77
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,153
This looks delicious.

78
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,613
-Eat up.
-I will.

90
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,847
This is authentic, right?

91
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,390
Yes, it's authentic.

92
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,936
They're by Kim Dae-jin,
Toegye Yi Hwang's academic successor.

93

The 416 woodblocks
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">of Jeongwaseonsaeng's Collected Works.</font></i>

94
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,109
It's hard to believe this large collection
was the work of a single author.

95
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,319
You're here.

96
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,031
How could I not come after seeing this?

97
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,034
Then why don't you

98
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,578
take a good photo for me?

99
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,848
Why did you come here?

100
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,392
I'm here on business.

101
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,729
Please purchase a policy from me.

102
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,233
Un-hyeong.

103
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,243
-What's this?
-What's this?

104
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,287
-Cool.
-What's over there?

DIVORCE INSURANCE INFORMATION

106
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,094
It's a divorce insurance policy.

107
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,099
It's literally insurance
in case of a divorce.

108
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,604
If you're in a tight spot,
I'll take out a different policy.

109
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,190
No.

110
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,027
It has to be this one.

111
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,993
I'm sorry,

112
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,996
but if you're trying to test me, stop it.

113
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,124
I'm not a jerk
who'd test his brother-in-law

114
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,418
after he lost his wife.

115
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,963
Right.

116
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,634
If you want me to feel guilty, I'll do it.

117
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,017
You look like an old man
with that white hair.

118
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,315
And your nose hair is showing.

119
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,986
Do you know how unpleasant
you look right now?

120
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,571
Ki-jun.

121
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,615
As a civil servant,
you should look the part.

122
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,617
There's only so long
you can drag this out.

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,830
How much longer will you
keep regretting, blaming yourself,

124
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,249
and living this pathetic way?

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,345
Why didn't you go to the hair appointment
when I told you to?

126
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,516
Why do you refuse to go
and make me come all this way?

127
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,482
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">And don't skip</font></i>

128
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,650
your hair appointment this weekend.

129
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,779
I'll take drastic measures
if you don't go again.

130
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,822
It got canceled again.

131
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,033
Do I have to go there myself?

132
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,661
UN-HYEONG
ARE YOU EATING WELL?

133
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,913
HOPE YOU DON'T CATCH A COLD

134
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,332
Jeez, it's raining again.

135
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,838
UN-HYEONG
IT'LL BE RAINING TODAY

136
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,383
TAKE AN UMBRELLA WITH YOU

137
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,013
Seriously, man.

138
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,933
He never cleans up.

139
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,728
UN-HYEONG

140
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,231
I REPLACED THE REMOTE CONTROL BATTERIES

141
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,691
SO WATCH SOME TV

142
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,661
UN-HYEONG
GO OUT FOR A DRIVE

143
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,664
INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING HOME
DURING THE WEEKEND

144
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,166
Winner winner chicken dinner!

145
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,754
THERE WAS A BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE
FRIED CHICKEN DEAL

146
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,094
If I had treated…

147
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,639
my sister…

148
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,353
even a fraction of the way
I've treated you…

149
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,108
She wouldn't have ended up like that.

150
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,530
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm sorry, Ki-jun.

152
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,246
I…

153
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:31,918
I…

154
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,379
I didn't know what to do!

155
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,223
So sign your name here.

156
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,893
Go and meet people.

157
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,937
Get married if you need to.

158
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,940
And get divorced if it doesn't feel right.

159
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,695
Just get your life back together.

160
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,659
I don't want to lose you too, Un-hyeong.

161
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,888
Stop!

162
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,114
What's the matter?

163
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,282
You're doomed.

164
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,707
PLEASE CHECK THE NON-WASHABLE ITEMS

165
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,375
You should've read the warning.

166
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,296
{\an8}DO NOT WASH PILLOWS
OR STUFFED DOLLS

167
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,048
THIS CAN DAMAGE THE MACHINE

168
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,926
Good luck with that.

169
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,571
You don't expect me to help, do you?

170
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,266
What should I do?

171
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,186
Don't touch anything.

172
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,704
START

173
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,874
It's working just fine.

174
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,546
You can't recycle this filler.

175
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,840
You have to buy a flammable waste bag
and dispose of it.

176
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,301
I'll remember that.

177
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,983
Thank you.

178
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,818
Right. I'll see you later.

179
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,028
By the way…

180
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,739
What's that?

181
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,552
It's the weekend. Where are you?

182
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,554
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm at a hotel.</font></i>

183
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,890
-At a hotel? With who?
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-With a guy.</font></i>

184
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,683
With a guy?

185
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,458
You sound surprised.

186
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,378
Do you think I'd be fooling around
with a guy at a hotel at this hour?

187
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,923
Mom forced me to go on a blind date.

188
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,971
No, go ahead. I can talk.

189
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,975
Right. What? Five contracts?

190
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,561
Where can we get contracts right now?

191
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,398
I'm going to lose it.

192
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,526
Okay, got it.

193
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,990
You have great energy. I do too.

194
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,408
I really don't care.

195
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,663
I heard you work in finance.

196
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,253
{\an8}I work in insurance.

197
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,256
Can you take out a policy for me?

198
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,549
It's for divorce insurance.

199
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,926
You're rather aggressive.

200
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,095
I need to get five contracts
signed right away.

201
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,264
You're very honest.

202
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,598
I'm also very rude.

203
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:48,683
I'm aware of that.

204
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,769
But you were forced
to come here anyway, right?

205
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,732
So stop wasting your time
on a rude woman like me,

206
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,483
and let's end our date now.

207
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,735
As you can see,

208
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,446
I'm rather busy. Sorry about today.

209
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,200
You're very passionate.

210
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,202
I like that passion. I'll sign up.

211
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,621
What's wrong with you?

212
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,707
What are you doing? Let go.

213
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,802
This is fate.

214
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,430
This ripped exactly in half.

215
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,601
I'll keep this half,
and we'll put it together next time.

216
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,894
Stop being dramatic.

217
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,107
What's all this?

218
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,651
One, two…

219
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,697
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Congratulations--</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Congratulations--</font></i>

220
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,079
This is fate.

221
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,330
Of all people, this happened to us.

222
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,172
It's in your hair…

223
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,591
Ms. Ah-young?

224
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,680
It's our break time,
but I'll make an exception for my regular.

225
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,725
I'll put a large single serving in this.

226
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,810
Thank you.

227
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,645
Isn't that a hassle?

228
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:20,399
Do you know how much plastic waste
each person produces in our country?

229
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,528
About 102 kg per year?

230
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,905
If you already know that…

231
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,283
Wait, how did you know?

232
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,578
I always review
statistical data carefully.

233
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,458
What about you, Mr. An? How did you know?

234
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,295
I always review
statistical data carefully as well.

235
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,551
Not many people
have weird obsessions like this.

236
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:48,970
-Fascinating.
-Fascinating.

237
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,578
{\an8}OKGYEONG'S SUNDAE

238
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,382
Was that your husband?

239
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,094
I'm sorry. I wish you hadn't seen that.

240
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,263
You have no reason to apologize.

241
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,599
How long has he been like that?

242
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:38,186
It's not like that.
He just had a few drinks.

243
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,146
He acts like that because you defend him!

244
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,109
I understand, ma'am.

245
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,863
But just because
he had a few drinks doesn't mean

246
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,323
he can treat you like this.

247
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,035
He's more like an enemy than a husband.

248
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,786
He drinks, gambles, and hits me.

249
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,831
And he takes whatever I save up.

250
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,125
I can't stand it.

251
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,004
Ma'am, how old are you this year?

252
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,465
Me? I'll be 60 years old.

253
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,510
-And your children?
-They're all grown and married now.

254
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,263
Then you've done enough.

255
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,313
PLUS GENERAL INSURANCE

256
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,067
What's this?

257
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,526
It's divorce insurance.

258
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,739
Divorce insurance?

259
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,577
You can't possibly go on like this.

260
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,622
We're not saying
you should just get divorced.

261
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,291
This insurance offers
marriage counseling services,

262
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,711
so get some relationship help first
and give it a try.

263
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,713
If he still doesn't change after that,

264
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,215
you can proceed with a divorce.

265
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,764
I'd love to do that,

266
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,142
but I'm not sure I can at 60 years old.

267
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,687
Ma'am.

268
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,855
At 60 years old,
you still have plenty of time ahead.

269
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,400
You deserve to be happy.

270
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,867
Ms. Ah-young!

271
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,662
I've always been the one
to pay the bill,

272
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,205
but you're the first one
to beat me to paying the bill.

273
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,293
Dinner is on me tonight.

274
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,053
-I have something to confess to you.
-Please don't.

275
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,930
I don't want to lie to you, Ms. Ah-young.

276
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,059
My profile says I'm a director
of a real estate development firm.

277
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,395
But it's just my name
on my father's company.

278
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,479
I'm actually…

279
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,526
a dancer.

280
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,238
Despite my parents' objections,
I want to pursue my passion for dance

281
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,741
and follow my own path.

282
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,161
Go on ahead.

283
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,091
What are you doing?

284
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,399
REALITY

285
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,160
Ms. Ah-young!

286
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,915
Taxi!

287
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,799
He's beyond insane.

288
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:58,863
Mr. Noh?

289
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,140
Where did you come running from?

290
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,479
From the history museum.

291
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,732
These are authentic, not fake.

292
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,947
Where are you going?

293
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,199
I don't know.

294
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,494
How can you go if you don't know?

295
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,412
I don't know.

296
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,998
I didn't want to stay home, so I came out.

297
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,291
Then take me with you.

298
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,709
Why should I do that?

299
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,045
I really want some good coffee.

300
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,554
You're better at your job than I expected.

301
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:09,183
She seemed to be
in desperate need of a divorce. Well then.

302
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,939
-Do you live in that direction?
-Yes.

303
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,817
Then lead the way
before I die of starvation.

304
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,865
No.

305
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:28,160
I don't invite anyone to my home.

306
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,245
Goodbye.

307
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,008
I guess it's pretty urgent.

308
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,730
CRO-MAGNONS
AND THE BRONZE AGE CASTING

309
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,856
"Cro-Magnons"?

310
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,944
It's ready.

311
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,738
Thank you.

312
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,864
Just a moment.

313
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,416
I'll just sit in this chair.

314
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,335
That chair is for the owner.

315
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:08,844
There you go.

316
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,404
Let's eat.

317
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,538
Thank you.

318
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,291
-Help yourself.
-Okay.

319
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,467
Good.

320
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,475
KIM GUN-BOK, KIM GA-YEON
KIM MIN-JOO, KIM MIN-WOOK

321
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,477
Kim Bo-gang is no good.

322
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,688
Kim Mi-jae is no good.

323
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,106
It's me, Dae-bok.

324
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,234
Hello?

325
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,694
Hey, Mi-jae. It's me.

326
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,279
You're busy? I just wanted to know…

327
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:12,199
Hello? Why are you busy on a weekend?

328
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,160
Hey, Seok-gi. It's me.

329
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,079
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hi, Dae-bok.</font></i>

330
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,706
It's the weekend. What are you up to?

331
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:19,790
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm sorry about this,</font></i>

332
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,334
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">but I took out a policy</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">a little while ago,</font></i>

333
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,170
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-so I can't do another one.</font></i>
-No, it's not that.

334
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,715
I just called to see
if you were up for a round of pool.

335
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,675
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Darn, my wife is calling me.</font></i>

336
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,928
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Let's talk again later.</font></i>
-Hey, Seok-gi. Hello?

337
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,437
How did my life turn out like this?

338
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,606
Jeez.

339
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:49,403
I wonder what my dear wife
posted this time.

340
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,487
SINGLE

341
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,822
What? Single?

342
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,574
Seriously?

343
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,329
I was just trying to make a living.

344
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,088
My goodness.

345
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,509
You've been through a lot, Dae-bok.

346
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,018
Right. This is how you share photos.

347
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,561
It worked.

348
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,230
This is my first social media post.

349
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,169
Are you awake now?

350
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,087
Why did you order so much?

351
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,423
Because you owe them the room charge.

352
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,719
You're too nice for your own good.

353
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,349
Why didn't you just wake me up?

354
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,893
You looked tired,
so I wanted you to sleep.

355
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:12,402
You sound just like her.

356
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,658
Why do you knit?

357
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,496
It stimulates the frontal, parietal,
occipital, and temporal lobes.

358
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,249
Jeez.

359
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,626
Actually, I want to be good at it.

360
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,589
Knitting each stitch together
to create something

361
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,633
reminds me of relationships
between people.

362
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,511
When I focus on knitting,

363
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:40,889
it soothes my anger in that moment,

364
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,766
and my anxiety disappears.

365
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,686
If I can unravel the mistakes of my life
and start over,

366
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,479
I think I can knit a new one.

367
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,233
I'm also excited to see if I can finish it

368
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,652
by just sticking with it.

369
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,946
I think that's why

370
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,991
I want to at least get good at knitting.

371
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:05,998
In that case,

372
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,542
please teach me how to knit.

373
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,920
You want to knit, Mr. Noh?

374
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,590
Yes. I have an unfinished knitting piece.

375
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,259
"An unfinished knitting piece"?
What is it?

376
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,053
I don't know.

377
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,441
Do you want to go and clear our heads?

378
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,825
This is a weird way to clear your head.

379
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,536
Buying something you like
makes you feel better.

380
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,000
Hey, eggs. Can you grab me a carton?

381
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,252
-This one?
-The smaller one.

382
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,631
-Thank you.
-No problem.

383
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:56,798
Green onions.

384
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,718
-Do you want to split this?
-No, thank you.

385
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,596
I always have leftovers
when I buy a bunch since I live alone.

386
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,348
But I need them for cooking.

387
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,600
Why can't they sell these in stalks,
not bunches?

388
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,061
I don't have a fridge,
so I'll have to decline.

389
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,313
You don't have a fridge?

390
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,898
Why not? Are you still in the Joseon era?

391
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,984
I got a new one after careful thought,
but he took it.

392
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,819
For some reason,

393
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,906
it just feels unfair
to buy two fridges in one year.

394
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,117
Right. Two fridges in one year
is a bit much.

395
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,913
Why did you break up?

396
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,290
Where's this coming from?

397
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,251
I just got curious all of a sudden.

398
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,797
Because I was stupid.

399
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:39,967
What about you, Mr. Noh?

400
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,388
Because I can be petty.

401
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,308
A FEW YEARS AGO

402
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,608
You must be tired.

403
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,110
-I'll take that.
-Thanks.

404
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,113
I'll have dinner ready soon.

405
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:03,907
-Dinner?
-Yes.

406
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:07,327
Darn. Let's have something simple tonight.

407
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,538
I have plans for dinner.

408
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,582
-You have plans?
-Yes.

409
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,793
There's a guy I knew
when I lived in New York.

410
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,211
He's in Korea, so we're meeting up.

411
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,382
If he came all the way from the US,
I guess you should see him.

412
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,551
I can take you there if you're tired.

413
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,512
No, it's okay. I'm meeting him at home.

414
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,975
I see. So he's coming over here?

415
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,437
That's good. Meeting at home is easier.

416
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,314
No, not here. My home.

417
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,234
"My home"?

418
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:41,862
-What do you mean by that?
-What?

419
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,948
Oh, I meant the place where I lived.

420
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,784
I thought you sold that place
after we got married.

421
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,163
Why would I get rid of my personal space?

422
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,001
What is it?

423
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,670
It's weird that you have a separate home.

424
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,130
What's weird about it?

425
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:05,135
I can certainly afford it,
and I need my own space.

426
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,348
But we're married.

427
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,060
That doesn't mean
we have to share everything.

428
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,647
You should have at least told me about it.

429
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,816
Why should I tell you everything?

430
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,154
Because we're a married couple.

431
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,864
A married couple?

432
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,743
So we have to agree on everything
because we're married?

433
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,245
That seems more weird to me.

434
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,750
Marriage is the biggest part of my life,

435
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,418
but I don't think it's everything.

436
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,838
Marriage shouldn't be
your everything either, Ki-jun.

437
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:42,923
Got it?

438
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,259
I'll see you later.

439
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,237
You can take the sofa.
I'll sit in the fishing chair this time.

440
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,449
-Are you sure?
-You sat in this earlier.

441
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,451
So it's my turn to sit
in the fishing chair.

442
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,495
That sounds fair.

443
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,996
No, this is my cup.

444
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,386
By the way,

445
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,305
why do you live this way
when you have plenty of room?

446
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,229
-I'm sick of it.
-What do you mean?

447
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,441
My ex-wife liked decorating the house.

448
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,404
So we had too many belongings.

449
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:51,658
Whenever I came home after work,
there would always be some new addition.

450
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,035
My wife claimed she did it for me.

451
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,748
But all it did was
push me further out of our house.

452
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,168
That's when I knew.

453
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,044
All I needed

454
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,381
was a space just for me.

455
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,052
I understand what you mean.

456
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,390
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

457
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,643
It's the need to defend
your personal space.

458
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,980
When I bring this up, people curse at me
instead of understanding.

459
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,567
I'm used to getting cursed at,
so I understand.

460
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,030
You're very chill.

461
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,036
By the way, what's that?

462
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:38,622
It's my pet rock.

463
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,416
"Pet rock"?

464
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,628
I brought it back from a fishing spot
when I went with Ki-jun.

465
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,296
Mr. Noh goes fishing?

466
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,839
Are you sure you two were married?

467
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,010
He never mentioned fishing to me.

468
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,762
Do you like to fish?

469
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,848
No. I hate it.

470
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,392
I guess he knew you hated it
and decided not to tell you.

471
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,399
We went fishing in the middle of winter.

472
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:09,611
I think it was right after
we both got divorced.

473
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,030
We didn't say a word about our divorces.

474
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:15,158
We only talked about dogs and cats
and whether we should get them as pets.

475
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:19,913
Our discussion about having pets
led to a discussion about ontology.

476
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,999
We eventually decided to give up
on having pets, but…

477
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,919
-But?
-But that's when

478
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,296
this rock caught my eye.

479
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,383
And I figured

480
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,803
this cold, expressionless rock

481
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:40,934
wouldn't get mad or make me feel guilty
even if it didn't find my jokes funny.

482
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,546
Yes, Mr. Noh.

483
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,464
Sorry, I just found it.
I'll be right there.

484
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,383
Su-in, look over there.

485
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,467
Hey.

486
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,846
Are you stalking me?

487
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,681
Why did you come here to shop?

488
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,517
And why didn't you send me
what I asked for?

489
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,436
I can't use my bidet because of you!

490
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:33,069
Jeez, what a moron.
You're really something.

491
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,822
What is it? Are you being invasive again?

492
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,491
Did you forget? Is that it?

493
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,702
Did you forget because you're an idiot?

494
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,162
Did you forget? Answer me.

495
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,167
What are you going to do?

496
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,336
What do you think you can possibly do?

497
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:53,381
You!

498
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,635
Are you crazy? Why are you yelling at me?

499
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:15,945
Who the hell are you?

500
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,674
Su-in, let's just go.

501
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,631
I'll bring my own chair next time.

502
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:20,927
Excuse me?

503
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,322
Damn it!

504
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,849
By the way,
where did you find that courage?

505
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:09,851
I was just angry.

506
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,644
You should get angry more often.

507
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:14,814
Seriously?

508
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,358
Thanks for giving me courage.

509
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:18,610
Don't mention it.

510
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,798
Understood.

511
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,675
Yes, I'll see you then.

512
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,427
Goodbye.

What will we do
about the five rejected cases?

519
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,355
We got three new contracts
over the weekend.

520
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,940
So we just need two more.

521
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:42,068
We'll take care of it as soon as possible.

522
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,862
We need a divorce rate of zero
during the six-month contract term.

523
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,824
How are you going to meet this condition?

524
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,701
We'll determine special management cases.

525
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,411
-"Special management cases"?
-Yes.

526
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:55,248
We'll select policyholders
who are at very high-risk for divorce

527
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,708
and closely monitor them.

528
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,877
How will you determine
this high-risk group?

529
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,214
As you said before, Korean astrology,
physiognomy, and profiling.

530
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:06,134
We'll use every means possible
to filter them out.

531
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:11,097
So you'll pull every trick in the book
to prevent divorces for six months.

532
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,890
No matter what comes next, we have to.

533
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:15,518
Is that all?

534
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,645
No, ma'am.

535
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,231
This is a list of partners
for divorce prevention.

536
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:23,610
For our special management cases,

537
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,321
we'll provide a variety
of divorce prevention measures,

538
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,282
such as couples golf,
couples travel, and couples therapy.

539
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:32,327
Sounds good.

540
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,332
Ms. Jeon, about this list of partners…

541
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:42,545
May I suggest a company
that's not on this list?

542
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,131
I'm open to it
if they come with better terms.

543
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,636
Let's move in teams then.

544
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:52,096
Yes, ma'am. Ms. Joh…

545
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:55,975
What's with the face?

546
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,186
It's nothing, sir.

547
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:02,440
I just think having to meet people
is really annoying.

548
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,233
Who? Me?

549
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,652
I'll see you in the lobby in ten minutes.

550
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,029
-Pack up and come downstairs.
-Okay.

551
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,033
Ms. Joh Ah-young, come see me at my desk.

552
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,750
Were you with Mr. Noh that day?

553
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:27,215
I was just wondering if it was yours.

554
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,510
Your ovulation day, that is.

555
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,596
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Tell him to prepare a business plan.</font></i>

556
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,434
TODAY IS YOUR OVULATION DAY
SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 23

557
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:41,688
What's that sound?

558
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:42,814
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">It's ovulation day.</font></i>

559
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,607
We'll talk business on a business day.

560
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,822
I was with him that day,
but it wasn't mine.

561
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,659
Is that so?

562
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,245
I guess it wasn't yours either, Ms. Jeon.

563
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,131
{\an8}DIVORCE PREVENTION PARTNERS LIST

564
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,674
{\an8}I'll handle the list up to here.

565
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,261
{\an8}Ms. Joh, you cover this part, okay?

566
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,804
Yes, sir.

567
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,104
-Actually, no.
-Excuse me?

568
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:28,359
Why don't you get creative
and find something young people like?

569
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:29,777
Get creative, sir?

570
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:33,322
I'll see you later, sir.

571
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,411
My tire's flat.

572
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:41,497
Oh, dear. Does this mean we can't go?

573
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,583
-Shall we take a taxi?
-No, I'll take care of it.

574
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:46,085
Don't worry about a thing.

575
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,062
I just went for coffee.
Did they already fix the tire?

576
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,522
Yes. Thank you.

577
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:08,316
That was quick, right? Get in.

578
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,615
WUSEOK TRAVEL AGENCY

579
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,284
Is this Wuseok Travel Agency?

580
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,495
-Yes.
-I see.

581
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,790
I'm here to see Director Kim Seok-gi.

582
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:24,957
He's right there.

583
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,084
Hey, Seok-gi!

584
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,546
Come on. Where do you think you're going?

585
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,674
Dae-bok, what brings you all the way here?

586
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,176
I'm sorry, but…

587
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:39,472
Don't be scared.
I'm not here to sell insurance.

588
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,016
Seok-gi.

589
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,936
Why don't you partner with us
on a project?

590
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,854
-A project?
-Yes.

591
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:49,607
Our company is developing
a new insurance product.

592
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,860
It's connected to that product,
so it should be good.

593
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,071
{\an8}MASTER OF PHYSIOGNOMY
DAE-SIN

594
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:59,075
{\an8}APPEARANCE ON THE TV SHOW

595
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:02,036
{\an8}These are the photos
of the divorce insurance policyholders.

596
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,831
Please look at the photos
and rank them based on

597
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,082
high divorce probability.

598
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,802
This is the order.

599
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,763
You live up to your reputation, sir.

600
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,014
Sir.

601
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:26,018
Is it really possible to learn about
someone's life through physiognomy?

602
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,145
Of course.

603
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,817
One's impression is
just a reflection of what's inside,

604
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,112
while physiognomy helps you
to read one's character.

605
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,989
In other words,

606
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,324
a person's life
depends on their character.

607
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:41,659
If you have different personalities,

608
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,620
it's no surprise
that married life could be difficult.

609
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:49,917
But isn't there
a specific way to read faces?

610
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,085
Of course, there is.

611
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,715
Your face consists of five key features.

612
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,217
Hold on, I need some paper.

613
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:04,891
Where is it?

614
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,769
Just draw it right here, sir.

615
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,522
Are you sure that's okay?

616
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:12,899
It'll be an honor, sir.

617
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,574
Thanks so much.

618
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,327
Don't mention it.
We're friends, after all.

619
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,203
Seok-gi, I reached out to you

620
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:29,290
because your company is solid
and more trustworthy than others.

621
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,834
You should be proud of yourself.

622
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,794
How's your wife? Is she well?

623
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,505
Of course. She's very well.

624
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,965
She's living it up these days.

625
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,843
She's never home
because she's always out and about.

626
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,678
My wife is the same way.

627
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:44,680
Really? But she used to be so reserved.

628
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:47,767
-That was a long time ago.
-Is that so?

629
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,770
Hey, think about our younger years.

630
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,230
We always got together
to drink and shoot pool

631
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:55,608
while our wives stayed at home
and raised the kids.

632
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,735
After spending
their younger years like that,

633
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,154
imagine how upset they must be
now that they're old.

634
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,033
At least we used our jobs as an excuse
to do whatever we wanted.

635
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,870
-It's understandable.
-You're right.

636
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,335
By the way, what's that place?

637
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,713
That's Rovaniemi, Finland.

638
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:22,009
It's Santa Claus' official residence.

639
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,386
Is that so?

640
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,931
-Jeez, it looks incredible.
-It's amazing, right?

641
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,392
They say if you watch
the Northern Lights together,

642
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:30,935
it can rekindle your love.

643
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,144
Really?

644
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,398
Have you been there?

645
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:38,651
Just because I run a travel agency
doesn't mean I can go everywhere.

646
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:42,238
I wish I could go see
the Northern Lights myself.

647
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,617
Let's go at least once before we die.

648
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,912
Yes, let's definitely do that.

649
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,042
Thank you for making time for us, sir.

650
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,919
Thank you so much, professor.

651
00:54:57,003 --> 00:55:00,297
By the way, is it okay for you
to leave like this?

652
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,260
Yes, sir. We can wipe this off later.

653
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:09,056
But there's something more important
than one's physical image.

654
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:11,934
It's your heart.

655
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:15,855
In the end, it's the heart
that shapes your physical image,

656
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,815
so it's possible
for your physiognomy to change.

657
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,818
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

658
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,323
-You look good.
-You too, Mr. Noh.

659
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,671
Hold still. Let me read your face.

660
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:41,756
Okay.

661
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,719
He said a good face has balanced features

662
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:49,513
that don't stand out in particular.

663
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,558
But all of your features stand out.

664
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,897
I'll read your face now.

665
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:06,739
Considering that
your superciliary arch is repressed,

666
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,200
and your nose is too small for your face--

667
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,701
What's wrong with my nose?

668
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,164
Hurry up and wipe your face.

669
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,665
Okay.

670
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,922
Time to wipe off my west peak.

671
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,009
All done.

672
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:29,804
Hey, that stings.

673
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,936
Of course, it stings.
You should wipe carefully.

674
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,646
Or else it'll get in your eyes.

675
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,023
-I'm okay.
-Let me do it.

676
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,484
Keep still and close your eyes.

677
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,079
Jeez.

678
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,293
Are you a panda?

679
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,588
-Whatever.
-I bet your favorite food is bamboo.

680
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,676
Just a second.

681
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,596
-Hello?
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Is this Mr. Noh Ki-jun?</font></i>

682
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:14,598
