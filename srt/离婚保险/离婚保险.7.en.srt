He doesn't seem
to have a toaster anywhere.

00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,607
Want to live in my apartment?

44
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,610
You should stay there.

46
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,040
You should stay at my place

Um…

48
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,880
Ah, I meant we should trade apartments.

49
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,882
Oh. What?

50
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,469
I don't particularly have
any fond memories of my place either.

51
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,972
Well, compared to yours,
it's probably nothing.

52
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,977
Oh, it actually might be uncomfortable
for you though. There's nothing there.

53
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,562
[Ki-jun] That won't be an issue.

54
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,064
And since we're in the same-sized
apartments in the same complex,

55
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,192
the cost would pretty much be the same,
so let's just switch places

56
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:21,363
without overthinking it too much.
Until one of us sells our apartment, okay?

57
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,573
What do you say?

58
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,866
Uh…

59
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,248
Okay, um, how about we give it a month?

60
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,584
"Give it a month"?

61
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,668

63
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,007
Honestly, I have often thought about

64
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,426
just packing up and leaving the apartment.

65
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,720
But I couldn't do that without a plan.

-[sighs] Just get out of there right now.
-Right now?

-Mm-hmm. So?
-I want to, it's just…

It's pretty bleak in here.

She should just toss that
or fill it with things.

You should just leave it on like this

NEVER MIND, I WAS JUST ASKING.
YOU CAN USE IT, MR. NOH.

183
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,503
[scoffs]

184
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,173
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE POLITE
ABOUT YOUR OWN TOASTER

185
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,927
I WON'T USE IT.
I'LL BRING IT TO YOU LATER.

186
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,139
OKAY. MESSAGE ME ANYTIME IF
YOU THINK OF ANYTHING YOU NEED.

187
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:38,188
AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING
THE ELEVATOR EARLIER.

188
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:46,237
OKAY. MESSAGE ME ANYTIME IF
YOU THINK OF ANYTHING YOU NEED.

189
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,661
WILL DO. SWEET DREAMS.

190
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,204
No. I shouldn't.

191
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,087
WILL DO.

192
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,718
WILL DO.

193
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,976
All right, got my pillow.

194
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,688
[sighing]

195
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,539
Unlike the legends
about the guardian rabbit on the moon,

196
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:41,501
the moon's patterns are
actually craters caused by fallen meteors.

197
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,672
Meteors entering Earth's atmosphere

198
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,716
either burn up due to intense friction,

199
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,176
or end up falling into the ocean.

200
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,098
Certain catastrophic events in the cosmos

201
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:00,145
leave scars so deep they remain
vivid and unhealed,

202
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,063
even after thousands of years.

203
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,525
[sighs]

204
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,196
I really should get
a bed in here soon or something.

205
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,948
[sighs]

206
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,491
Let's just sleep.

-[alarm] Good morning.

00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,015
ALARM QUESTION

210
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,058
What the… [grunts]

211
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,104
-[music continues]
-How am I supposed to solve this?

-[doorbell rings]

213
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,659
I thought you might miss this.

214
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,536
So much.

218
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,799
It seems like you had
a really good night's sleep.

219
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,219
[chuckling]

220
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,472
-Here, let me. Hold on… [chuckles]
-Oh. Oh, my gosh.

221
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,974
Come down when you're ready for work.
I'll be waiting.

222

Oh, my gosh.

[sighs]

227
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,581
Ms. Kang, over here. Get in.

228
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,672
So, how was your night?
Did you sleep well?

229
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,091
-Yeah, I slept well. Thank you.
-That's good to hear.

230
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,218
Thank you for earlier, you know?

231
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,344
Hmm?

232
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,138
I know you showed up on purpose
to help with the alarm.

233
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,265
[gasps] Ah.

234
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,809
Well, it's not like I could send
Jeon-man your way instead, so…

235
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,978
[both chuckling]

236
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,858
Oh, this is actually my favorite thermos.

237
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:10,942
How did you know?

238
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,903
I didn't.
It's just that this one caught my eye.

239
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,864
I guess we have a similar eye for things.

240
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,242
This is for you. Let's see
if we like the same food too.

241
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,494
Ooh. [chuckles]

242
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,038
[grunting]

243
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,541
Mmm. It's so good.

244
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,625
Mm-hmm.

245
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,836
When did you have time to make this?

246
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,212
-[chuckles]
-[Ki-jun] Mmm.

247
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,883
[moans] Wow. Yum.

248
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,885
There's no rush. Take your time eating.

249
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,469
Thank you.

250
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,306
-Off we go. Mm-hmm.
-Off we go.

251
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,726
-Do you want some coffee?
-Sure, sure.

252
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,065
Wow. The coffee is so good.

253
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,443
You like it? Is the flavor strong enough?

254
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,819
It could be a little stronger.

255
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,946
-Okay. I'll keep that in mind.
-Okay.

256
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,626
So, you're commuting to work together?

257
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,090
Are you sure there's nothing
between you two?

258
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,303
[elevator bell dings]

259
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,599
We, uh… We should head up.

260
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,725
Shall we, Ms. Kang?

261
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,439
If they're commuting to work together,

262
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,775
that means they're
more than just coworkers.

263
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,486
What do you think, Mr. An?

264
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,699
Well, maybe they just carpooled.

265
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,284
[Na-rae] Uh-huh.

266
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,203
[elevator bell dings]

267
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,871
How did you know it was me though?

268
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,250
I thought I caught a whiff of you.

[romantic music playing]

270
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,799
You're being really cute right now.

271
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,098
Calling a man cute is the kiss of death.

272
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,083
[employee 1] Wait,
please hold the door! [grunts]

273
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,921
-Excuse me.
-[employee 2] Oh, apologies.

Sheesh.

Ow.

280
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,505
Excuse me.

[grunting]

282
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,633
Oh, sure.

[inhales deeply, sighs]

288
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,556
How about we have
a little talk before heading in?

289
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,815
I'm sorry. I've probably put you

290
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,609
in a really awkward position.

291
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,776
Not at all.

292
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,822
This isn't entirely your fault.

293
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,747
[sighs] If so,

294
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:01,334
shall we try
to define what's happening between us?

295
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,797
If short answers are hard,
we could do multiple-choice.

296
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,099
Please describe our relationship

297
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,770
by responding to these questions
with "colder" or "warmer" as relevant.

00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,439
Sure.

300
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,443
One, are we neighbors?

301
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,820
[chuckles] Warmer.

302
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,824
Two, coworkers?

303
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:34,909
Warm.

304
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,163
Three, are we friends?

305
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,377
Warmer.

Oh…

309
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,262
Four would be…

310
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,515
Colder.

311
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,602
I'm sorry. I think we're
between three and four,

312
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,938
-but I can't think of a suitable term.
-[grunts]

313
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,607
Since our relationship is so evasive.

314
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,027
So, let's call it a gray zone.

315
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,281
So, you think we're in a gray zone?

316
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,740
Mm-hmm.

317
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,537
-[chuckles] That's a great idea.
-Do you like that?

318
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,539
For now.

319
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,623
Great.

320
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:26,210
Then, let's keep our relationship in the
gray until we figure out our number four.

321
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,962
Agreed. Then, um…

322
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,506
[stammers] I'll be "gray." All right?

323
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,550
[chuckles] Then I'll be "zone."

324
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,552
To hang with "gray."

-Why? What is it, sir?

00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,653
-What? What? What?
-What's going on?

329
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,406
An insurance claim has been filed
for Ms. Woo Seon-hee.

330
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,615
-Huh?
-[Jeon-man, Ki-jun] What?

331
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,617
Ms. Woo Seon-hee is filing for divorce!

332
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,161
-Hold on.
-Hurry! Find out what happened!

333
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,121
Ms. Woo Seon-hee.
She's not on our priority list,

334
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,414
or in our high-risk group though.

335
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,291
Oh, I think she's our latest applicant.

336
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,085
Besides, she couldn't submit a claim.
There's a 90-day exemption.

337
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,170
-Right.
-Oh, my God.

338
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,463
What are you rambling on about?

339
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,839
You think we don't know that?

340
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,800
Did you forget about the zero percent
divorce rate for the next six months?

341
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,386
What's it matter
if it falls apart now or in 90 days?

342
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,763
How are you going to handle this?

343
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,350
They are at the courthouse signing
their divorce papers as we speak!

344
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,311
Do you really think this is the time
to just sit around like this?

345
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,937
-No, that can't happen!
-Oh, no, sir!

346
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:29,690
-No! We can't. We can't!
-Move it! Move it right now. Hurry!

347
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,901
This is not the time to grab your scarf!

348
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,652
We don't have time for that.
Come on, you fools!

349
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:34,862
Hurry up! I said move!

then we split up.

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,504
Wait. They're in front of us.

358
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,963
Where?

359
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,051
Remember, you wanted this.

360
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,763
I simply took it
upon myself to fulfill your wish.

361
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,307
Thank you then, I guess. Hmm.

362
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,310
What a change given you've never listened
to a word I've said all these years.

363
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,271
Unbelievable. The least
you could do is apologize.

364
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,649
Woman, have you no shame in the least?

365
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,734
None at all.

366
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,779
So it's time you left
a stubborn, ignorant woman like me

367
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,155
and found someone who offers more.

368
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,908
Someone younger,
more vivacious, more affectionate,

369
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,786
who truly brings out the best in you.

370
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,457
I'm ready to live life on my own terms
and embrace the future I deserve.

371
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,959
On what terms?

372
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,293
What are you talking about?

373
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,964
Young-kyu. Calm down before you pass out.

374
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,882
This isn't the place
to work yourself up, you know?

375
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,676
Let's just go home.

376
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,179
[sighs] Why the hell is she doing
this to me?

377
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,931
Do we have food at home?

378
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,891
Honey, let's eat
if your blood sugar is low.

379
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,560
[Seon-hee] Oh, please.

380
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,438
Don't pretend to be
all caring and thoughtful.

381
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,939
You never take me out.

382
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,610
It looks like they've already submitted
their divorce papers.

383
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,946
We're screwed. Completely screwed.

384
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,030
[sighs]

385
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,533
Let's go.

386
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,536
[sighs]

387
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,666
Get out. All of you.

388
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,710
Now. I don't want to see you. [sighs]

389
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,463
And this? What now, huh? [pants]

390
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,756
What the hell are we going
to do about it? [coughs]

391
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,384
[sighs] Ah, God. I'm stressed. [grunts]

392
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,678
[Na-rae] We still have four weeks left.

393
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,890
Oh. Hello, Ms. Jeon.

394
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,767
It's so good to… Oh, apologies. Oh, gosh.

395
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,519
[sighs]

396
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,563
Sorry.

397
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,568
This isn't your typical situation,
you know, Ms. Jeon.

398
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,528
A geriatric divorce isn't a simple matter

399
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:42,490
because it's a result of 10,
maybe 20, years of resentment.

400
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:45,367
Come on. That's why I have
you all here, right?

401
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,164
Just work together
and you'll figure it out.

402
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,042
We need them to reconsider
within the four-week exemption period.

403
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,336
-Get to work.
-Yes, ma'am.

404
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,758
How can we possibly change these people's
minds in less than four weeks though?

405
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,134
Aren't you all going in?

406
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,220
-Well, you'd better before I…
-Yeah, okay. We're coming.

407
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,304
We're coming, sir.

408
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,517
All of you lurking round the office,
come in, now!

409
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,143
-[Jeon-man] Coming now.
-[Ki-jun] Go, go, go.

410
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:17,233
POLICYHOLDER
PERSONAL INFORMATION

411
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,071
If she's not on either the priority
or high-risk group list,

412
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,448
this divorce might have been
an impulsive decision.

413
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:29,161
[sighs] Well, the thing about divorce,
it can never be impulsive.

414
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,579
Well, how so?

415
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,254
You'll get it once you've experienced it.

416
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,674
Anyhow, in a geriatric divorce,
this is especially true.

417
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,051
Couples have likely fought
many battles over the years.

418
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,345
Battles. [scoffs]
Yeah, you've had your share.

419
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,391
-[sighs] Ah, well, back to business.
-[clears throat]

420
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,685
Seriously, why was she
never flagged as being high-risk?

421
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,938
If she wasn't genuinely considering
divorce, that could be the reason.

422
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,982
You're telling me they filed
for divorce together,

423
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,150
without ever intending to follow through?

424
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,361
And how can you be so sure?

425
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,321
We saw them outside the courthouse

426
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,574
leaving together
after submitting their divorce papers.

427
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,451
They seemed inseparable,
like two peas in a pod.

428
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,037
They kept going on and on about divorce,
but to me

429
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,248
it seemed like they weren't
truly grasping the situation.

430
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,874
What are you talking about?

431
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,752
[Seon-hee] Young-kyu.
Calm down before you pass out.

432
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:22,464
Do we have food at home? Honey,
let's eat if your blood sugar is low.

433
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,509
-Mmm. You're right.
-Hold on. This makes no sense.

434
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,803
Why file for divorce if you don't intend…

435
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:33,475
Huh? Don't tell me they're…
they're after the insurance payout?

436
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,768
No.

437
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,313
If they wanted the payout,
wouldn't they consider

438
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,897
the exemption period before filing?

439
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:42,484
-No.
-Exactly. It's just strange though.

440
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,529
The fact that she signed up for
divorce insurance at her age, you know?

441
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,574
I wonder how she even found out
about it in the first place.

442
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,951
Couldn't agree more. Jesus.

443
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,537
About that…

444
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,873
-[exclaim]
-[scream]

445
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,459
-Who is it? [exclaiming]
-It's me. It's okay.

446
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,752
Who are you? Who are you?

447
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,462
Calm down. Calm down, everyone.

448
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,756
-[panting]
-[Dae-bok] Everything was escalating

449
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,841
so rapidly that I
completely forgot to introduce him.

450
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,510
So, this is my former mentee
who works in insurance.

451
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,678
Come on now, sit down.

452
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,263
-Hey, hey, say hello.
-For crying out loud.

453
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,598
-This is our senior managing director.
-Oh, gosh.

454
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,308
-And here are the team members.
-[all sighing]

455
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,226
-That's right.
-Uh, it's a pleasure to meet you all.

456
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,519
-Likewise, I guess.
-I'm Nam Chang-hee,

457
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,897
I sell insurance in Ssangmun-dong.
I'm excited to collaborate.

458
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,607
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Same here, sir.

459
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,442
-[Dae-bok] Come on, let's sit down.
-You okay, sir?

460
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,612
We're short on time, so, uh,
will you please sit down so we can resume?

461
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,906
-Ma'am, please go ahead. Okay.
-[Ki-jun clears throat]

462
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,116
And why is he here?

463
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,120
Oh, right. About that… You see,
since we had a couple of rejections--

464
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,330
Mr. Na.

465
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,167
I'd like to hear his answer, not yours.

466
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,669
Huh?

467
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,588
Uh, yes. My apologies, ma'am.

468
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,049
Well, Mr. Na asked me

469
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:51,095
to handle the two sales rejections
in an effort to secure new sales.

470
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,680
And so?

471
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,182
And so I did exactly that.

472
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,725
Meaning?

473
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,937
I helped Grandma Seon-hee apply for
divorce insurance coverage.

474
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,898
No kidding.

475
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,108
[stammers]

476
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,403
-Ah.
-[Ki-jun sighs]

477
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,156
TEXT, TEXT, TEXT

478
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,701
-[upbeat music playing]
-[attendees clapping]

479
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,496
ENERGETIC AND EXCITING
SINGING CLASS

480
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,499
[Chang-hee, attendees singing in Korean]

481
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,695
-[Seon-hee cries]
-Okay, let's hold for a moment, please.

482
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,365
We'll resume once I talk, talk, talk
the tears from this lady's eyes.

483
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,533
-[sighs]
-[attendees murmuring]

484
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,994
[Chang-hee] You see, Grandma Seon-hee
takes a singing class

485
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,371
at one of the venues where I do my sales.

486
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,999
But she caught everyone off guard by
breaking down in tears during a song.

487
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,083
Thank you.

488
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,710
Ma'am, are you feeling better now?

489
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,463
I received a message
from a friend of 30 years,

490
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,630
sharing that her home is

491
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,048
-on the verge of being taken.
-Go on.

492
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:13,135
So how could I have
possibly turned her down?

493
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,219
[Chang-hee] I see.

494
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,805
[Seon-hee] That scammer deliberately
deceived me.

495
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,973
-Oh.
-[Seon-hee sobs]

496
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,809
So why am I the one
who has to take the fall?

497
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,896
[Chang-hee] It turned out she
fell victim to a phishing scam.

498
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,898
Fortunately, no money was lost.

499
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,025
But her husband must have
reprimanded her quite severely.

500
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,359
Always calling me names…

501
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:32,988
Ignorant and frustrating. As if
I'm incapable of understanding anything.

502
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,491
Throwing his weight around
just because he earns the money,

503
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,077
while making me feel like
nothing more than a servant who cooks

504
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,996
and does his damn laundry.

505
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,247
[gasping, murmuring]

506
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,210
It may be too late for me to say this,
but I want a divorce now.

507
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,337
Oh, please don't say that now.

508
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,172
Or you'll just regret it later.

509
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,174
Think of all the years you've put up
with your husband.

510
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,093
Unless you have something like this
to fall back on.

511
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,095
Say more.

512
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,056
[stammers]

513
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,600
What… What makes her so special?
Why her of all people?

514
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,186
I just thought all we had to do
was increase the policyholders.

515
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,979
Okay. Hmm.

516
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,481
[groans] Just my luck.

517
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,066
[inhales sharply]

518
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,819
Forgive me, ma'am.
I've committed a deadly sin.

519
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,863
[Ah-young]
But still that justifies nothing,

520
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,783
who gets divorced over falling for
a phishing scam. That's ridiculous.

521
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,744
The phishing scam was just the last straw
for her pent-up emotions.

522
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,162
That's right.

523
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:25,415
You wouldn't believe how stingy
and stubborn Grandpa Young-kyu can be,

524
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,668
and he disrespects Grandma Seon-hee
quite often.

525
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,086
-[Ki-jun sighs]
-Hmm.

526
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:33,382
However, it wouldn't be fair
to blame Grandpa Young-kyu entirely.

527
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,301
The truth is Grandma Seon-hee often
gets herself into financial trouble

528
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:40,138
by co-signing loans and lending money
all because of her kind-hearted nature.

529
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,057
-[sighs]
-[Ah-young] For God's sake.

530
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,978
[groans] The valley is deep.
The valley is deep.

531
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,146
Hey, Ki-jun, what should we do?

532
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,400
You can make this work, right?

533
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,402
[sighs]

534
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,320
Now that we have a sense of the situation,

535
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,739
Ms. Joh and I will go meet with Ms. Woo
and discuss with her.

536
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,116
-Yeah, okay.
-[Ah-young] Okay.

537
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,828
All right, then. Um, I guess Mr. An and I
will meet with the husband, and I--

538
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,912
No, you can't… Don't.

539
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,622
-You can't meet the husband.
-Why not?

540
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,667
Well, he'll hit the roof if he finds out
Grandma Seon-hee took out insurance.

541
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,129
He'll rant about her getting scammed again
because she's so naive.

542
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,672
[sighs]

543
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:17,259
And if he learns it's divorce insurance,
he might actually want to get divorced.

544
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,594
Yeah, it figures.

545
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:23,265
If I ever found out my wife secretly…
[crying] …took out a divorce insurance …

546
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,808
[breathes shakily, cries]

547
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,227
The very thought of it is horrifying.

548
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:28,645
-[crying]
-Uh…

549
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,355
Oh, come on.

550
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:34,109
Don't worry, all right?
That's never going to happen. You're okay.

551
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,028
The old lady didn't actually
take out the insurance--

552
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,779
Come on, that's our team leader's wife.

553
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,198
Oh, sorry, Mr. Na.
I meant Ms. Lee, Ms. Lee.

554
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,285
-[taps pen]
-Mr. Na.

555
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,246
[hiccups]

556
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,748
My apologies, Ms. Jeon.

557
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,959
Okay. We'll hold off directly
addressing this with the husband for now.

558
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,419
Let's first get a sense of the situation.

559
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,546
[hiccups] But how?

560
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,423
You'll see him for pent-up anger.

561
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,300
And you for a cervical hernia.

562
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,719
And I'll… [groans]

563
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,598
My disc has slipped. It slipped. Oh, God.
[groaning]

564
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,396
ONSAEM KOREAN MEDICINE CLINIC

565
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,483
-She and her husband live upstairs here?
-Hmm.

566
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:17,945
Let's see now… Oh.

567
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,738
-Mmm?
-Over there.

568
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,325
I think that's her.

569
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,409
Let's go over to her.

570
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,204
Oh, my, ma'am!

571
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,207
Ooh. Not everyone has someone to
shop and cook for them, you know?

572
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,667
Your husband is so lucky.

573
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,877
-Enough with the flattering.
-All right, ma'am.

574
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,546
By the way,
where's Dr. Park been running off to?

575
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,881
He's goes out often these days.

576
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:40,092
-Mmm. Is that so?
-Yeah.

577
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,220
He's so full of energy lately,
like he's turned back the clock.

578
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,639
I've noticed he's looking younger,
isn't he? [chuckles]

579
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,683
[Seon-hee] My husband has always
been like that.

580
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:51,269
Well, silly, that's why
you should dress up more, you know?

581
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,648
No, this isn't how a doctor's wife
should dress, don't you think?

582
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:58,193
Men, regardless of age, always seem to
prefer younger women, huh?

583
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,780
-Oh, come on. Enough with your nonsense.
-Okay, if you say so.

584
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,949
Why don't you come over
and enjoy a hot cup of tea?

585
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,909
-Wha… Goodness.
-Please, come over.

586
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:08,245
-[Seon-hee groans]
-Oh, just come already.

587
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,372
-Come on. Let's follow them.
-Let's go.

588
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,458
[receptionist] Mr. Na Dae-bok,
the doctor will see you now.

589
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,004
DIRECTOR PARK YOUNG-KYU

590
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,214
[sighs]

591
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,799
Ah, nice to meet you, Doctor.

592
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:24,219
-Huh? [chuckles] Have a seat?
-Yes, yes, of course.

593
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,890
Oh, my God, that… [chuckles]

594
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,769
[Young-kyu] What's wrong
with your complexion?

595
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,148
You're still quite young, and yet
you look like life's drained out of you.

596
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,441
[gasps]

597
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,944
You're truly an exceptional doctor, sir.
[gasps]

598
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,281
I mean, how can you tell,
just from one single look at my face?

599
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,365
-Wow.
-[chuckles]

600
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,659
I'll check your pulse to be sure.

601
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,995
-Come on. Give me your hand.
-Sorry? Ah, yes.

602
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,330
[Young-kyu sighs]

603
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,458
[sighs]

604
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,795
You have that unsettling sensation of
a lump in your bowels,

605
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,089
one that occasionally throbs, right?

606
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,176
Yeah, yeah, doctor. It throbs. Yeah, yeah.

607
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,053
-Whoa.
-Not only do you have trouble sleeping,

608
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:09,097
but those early mornings
leave you feeling out of sorts.

609
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,683
Plus, you suffer from
a constant migraine sleep can't cure.

610
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,268
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,895
You have pent-up anger.

612
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,522
You shouldn't let your stress
go untreated, you know.

613
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:18,857
[gasps] Ah, yeah.

614
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:26,281
[inhales sharply] Uh, well.
To be honest, I went through a divorce.

615
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,283
I guess that's why
I've been so stressed out.

616
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,576
[laughing]

617
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,120
Divorce?

618
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,914
I can promise you,
it was the right decision.

619
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,957
Your stress level has to drop now.

620
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,585
No, that can't be right, sir.

621
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:43,215
Every day, I come home from work to
a house that feels completely cold, empty.

622
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,801
Saving on your electricity bill
is a nice bonus.

623
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,763
Whenever I throw together
a quick meal on my own…

624
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,516
[sighs] …I can't help but wonder
why life has to be so hard.

625
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,351
Well, go to a soup kitchen then.

626
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,145
During election season,
they offer special meals

627
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,730
and even assemblymen help serve food.

628
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:01,900
Still though, what if you get sick
or something?

629
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,319
How about some acupuncture? Get up.

630
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,821
-Acupuncture?
-Get up.

631
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,280
-Up, up. Take your jacket off.
-Well, sir…

632
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:10,158
I've never actually
had acupuncture before.

633
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,409
Come on, let's go.

634
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,744
-Sure.
-Now, come this way.

635
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,329
Excuse me? Wait… Where are you? Hold on.

636
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,873
-Over here. Now lie down.
-Now, Doctor, wait a minute. [grunts]

637
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,250
[breathes shakily]

638
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,502
Pent-up anger results from
energy blockages.

639
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,586
Acupuncture's the best.

640
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,171
Oh, my goodness, sir.

641
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,758
Just how old are you?
How do you have such energy, Doctor?

642
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,511
It's another one of the perks of divorce.

643
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,722
Without pointless arguments draining you,
you feel more energized.

644
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,267
Isn't that more of a downside to divorce?

645
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,228
Bursting with energy
but lonelier than ever--

646
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,188
Streaming services!

647
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,523
Check them out.

648
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,691
Streaming services…

649
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,943
Streaming services.

650
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,371
[stammers]

651
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,293
I'll unblock your Hegu point too,
so try to get some good rest.

652
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,466
[phone buzzing]

653
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,429
He really is an exceptional doctor.

654
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,224
-[yawns]
-[Young-kyu] Hello?

655
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,311
Oh, you called. Yes.

656
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,813
My, God. Madam Choi, really?

657
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,481
Perhaps you're free right now?

658
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,693
I can't wait to come by.

659
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,613
Yes, all right then.
I'll be right there. Bye.

660
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,697
A lady?

661
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,781
[chuckles]

662
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,121
-Sir, the nurse will…
-[whimpers]

663
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,123
…remove the needles when it's time.

664
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,542
-[door opens, closes]
-[Dae-bok grunts] That hurts.

665
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,545
[groaning, straining]

666
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,591
-[line rings]
-God, it hurts.

667
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,593
[Ki-jun] Oh, man. My back. [groaning]

668
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,055
-[phone buzzing]
-Oh, it hurts.

669
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,139
What's going on now?

670
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,479
-What's up?
-Damn, it's pri… [whimpers]

671
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,605
"Damn it," what?

672
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,357
-No, it's not our turn yet.
-Uh…

673
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,650
[sighs]

674
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,610
[both groaning]

675
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,070
-No more consultations for today.
-[receptionist] Sir?

676
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,154
It's something urgent.

677
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,447
Wait, Dr. Park.

678
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,164
-[Dae-bok] Go after him now!
-[gasps]

679
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,958
-We have to go after him!
-Hurry!

680
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,793
-Follow him. Jesus.
-[pants]

681
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,383
That's right,
I've been meaning to talk to you

682
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,219
[sighs] I'm glad I ran into you.

683
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,679
Why do you look so sad?

684
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,639
[sighs] It's nothing.

685
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,643
It's doesn't look like nothing.
What's going on?

686
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,980
Well, you see.
Her father's in the hospital,

687
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,773
but it seems like
they're going to discharge him

688
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,733
because his hospital bills are overdue.

689
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,986
They've stopped his treatment,
and he's about to be kicked out.

690
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,738
Oh, no. What now?

691
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:56,700
I-I could… Just, um, well… If…

692
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:00,662
If I sell my house and downsize,
it seems like it might work out,

693
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,833
but the real estate market
is practically dead these days, you know?

694
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,335
Why don't you ask Ms. Woo for help?

695
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,839
Hey. Don't be absurd.
I doubt she has any money to give.

696
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:11,923
[hairdresser grunts]

697
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,971
[sighs]

698
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:21,558
[bag opens]

699
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,268
[paper rustles]

700
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,480
Here. For you.

701
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,691
Ma'am, what is this?

702
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:32,360
Well, to be honest,

703
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:36,489
I was saving this to use as a deposit
if I found a house for myself.

704
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,284
A place for yourself?
Why would you need a new house?

705
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,703
[Seon-hee]
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

706
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,497
But you seem to be
in more urgent need of this.

707
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,667
Use it to cover
your father's hospital bills first.

708
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:51,338
[hairdresser]
Wow, you're the best, Ms. Woo.

709
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,131
Take it now. Pay her back with interest.

710
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,841
I'm your witness, okay?

711
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:55,925
[scoffs]

712
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,761
Thank you, Ms. Woo.

713
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:01,348
You know, no one offered to help,
not even my husband or siblings.

714
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,601
Oh. How long have we known each other?
It's fine.

715
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,686
I swear… Listen.

716
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,189
I'll sell my house quickly
and repay you with interest in full.

717
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,607
You don't need to.

718
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,986
Just waive your commission fee
when I find a house.

719
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,614
Hey, Ms. Woo, what's going on?

720
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,824
Are you really looking
for a place to rent?

721
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,496
Okay, guys. I'll go home.
I have to cook dinner.

722
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,625
My husband insists on having
fresh rice and soup for every single meal.

723
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:29,709
No matter what.

724
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:33,880
Thank you so much, ma'am. I'll repay you
in full, as soon as possible.

725
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,465
-Take care.
-[footsteps approaching]

726
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,300
Ladies, are you here for a hair cut?

727
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,011
-We'll come back later. Sorry.
-[hairdresser] Huh?

728
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:42,472
-[chuckles] Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

729
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,933
Pick one. Pick one. Take your pick!

730
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,357
[Jeon-man]
Why would he suddenly come here?

731
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,650
How should I know?

732
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,780
He seems really excited though.

733
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,784
Oh, look at that. Is this the Titanic?
Whoa.

734
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,327
How about I give you a great deal?
150,000.

735
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,538
You're obviously more excited, aren't you?

736
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:07,622
It's that obvious?

737
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,250
You geeking out like in
an elementary school treasure hunt.

738
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,544
Geeking out? Does this work, sir?

739
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,087
[vendor 1] Perfectly. 150,000.

740
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,339
Hey, hey, quit geeking out. Come on.

741
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,550
-[vendor 1] 130,000?
-Uh, well… I'll come back.

742
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,304
Seriously, where did
all this stuff come from?

743
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,390
This is a real flea market.
You might catch fleas.

744
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,975
Better not know where they come from.

745
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,644
Wha… Hey, a Mymy cassette player.

746
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,062
-Check this.
-[gasps] So great.

747
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,690
[gasps] I can't believe
this is still around.

748
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,317
-[vendor 2] It's rare to come by.
-[giggles]

749
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:38,778
Ah, Madam Choi, thank you for meeting me.

750
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:39,863
Hi.

751
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,907
[chuckles] I'm glad you could make it.

752
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:43,992
Yeah. [chuckles]

753
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,076
Oh.

754
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,455
-You're picking it up?
-Of course, how could you not buy this?

755
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,248
Can you knock 20,000 won off?

756
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,375
I can't. I'm already selling it at a loss.

757
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,335
-He's selling it at a loss.
-All right.

758
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,050
Hey. Hey.

759
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,178
Look. He's gone now.

760
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,888
-That's too bad.
-Jesus!

761
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,389
[vendor 2] Thanks for your purchase.

762
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,849
-Take care.
-Have a great day, sir.

763
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,392
Oh…

764
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:10,852
You screwed up.

765
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,145
[Jeon-man] What do we do now?

766
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,229
[sighs]

767
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,982
-Hey, hey, hey. Over there. Over there.
-Oh, I see them.

768
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,609
[pants] Look, look.

769
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,110
[Jeon-man] Who's that with him?

770
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,156
[engine starts]

771
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,581
[grunts]

772
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,001
Ms. Woo Seon-hee?

773
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,503
-Ms. Woo Seon-hee.
-Wait, ma'am.

774
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,087
-[Han-deul] Ms. Woo.
-[Ah-young] Ma'am.

775
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,589
Oh, hello, ma'am.

776
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:40,673
Hi, how are you?

777
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,133
Who are you?

778
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,344
You filed for a divorce insurance claim
recently, right?

779
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,304
We're from Plus General Insurance.

780
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,223
Right, the divorce.

781
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,683
I filed for divorce. That's right.

782
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:53,353
But what brings you insurance people
all the way out here?

783
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,772
We're here because you filed
an insurance claim, ma'am.

784
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,815
-Ah, the claim for the divorce.
-[chuckles]

785
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,360
When will the insurance payout be issued?

786
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,444
[Han-deul stammers]

787
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:06,991
Well, we came to see you
to actually explain everything to you.

788
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,868
Do you have a minute to talk right now?

789
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:12,121
Three whole months?

790
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,457
Yes, it's called the exemption period.

791
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:15,542
For this specific product,

792
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,294
coverage becomes available
90 days after the sign-up date.

793
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:21,256
[chuckles] I'm sure you were informed
when you signed up.

794
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,049
-I believe I was.
-[chuckles]

795
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:24,926
I mean, I suppose so.

796
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,928
[both chuckle]

797
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:30,723
So, I just need to file for divorce
after 90 days, right?

798
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:32,850
Uh, that's exactly right.

799
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,186
In the mean time, would you consider
couple's therapy to help you?

800
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,355
-Would you?
-Therapy?

801
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,648
Yes.

802
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,483
Our divorce insurance policy comes with

803
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,819
access to various
marriage improvement programs

804
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,445
designed to help those who sign up.

805
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,989
Improvement programs?

806
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,408
[Ah-young] Yes, you can
receive couples therapy

807
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,910
or you might consider taking up
a shared activity or hobby.

808
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:54,455
Like learning salsa dancing together
or something of that nature.

809
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,291
No, I don't want any of that at all.

810
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,543
-There's no additional cost…
-[Han-deul] Uh…

811
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,795
…and once you try it,
I'm sure you'll enjoy it. [chuckles]

812
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:04,090
No…

813
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,510
I want this divorce.

814
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,014
-[sighs]
-[Han-deul] I see.

815
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,933
[sighs]

816
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,852
Why do you want to leave your husband?

817
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,229
You've made it through
all these years without issue.

818
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,193
My husband has kept his youthful spirit.

819
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:28,114
His spirit? Huh?

820
00:48:28,865 --> 00:48:32,744
So, I'll file the insurance claim
after 90 days.

821
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,911
Are we all set then?

822
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:36,247
-[stammers, clears throat]
-Oh.

823
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:37,332
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay.

824
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,626
[Seon-hee grunts] Oh, gosh.

825
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,884
Well, then. Good day to you both.

826
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,470
Should you ever need more questions,

827
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,264
feel free to reach out to me anytime.

828
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:56,309
-Thank you, Insurance Lady.
-[chuckles]

829
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,227
Go along now.

830
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,146
-We'll talk more soon.
-Mmm.

831
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,065
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Okay.

832
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,149
Goodbye, ma'am.

833
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,233
Bye.

834
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,779
[door opens, closes]

835
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,495
Sir, please tell me. What's the latest
update on the divorce insurance product?

836
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,579
Yes, ma'am.

837
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,457
I forwarded the risk data
and terms and conditions you provided

838
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,541
to the relevant departments.

839
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,336
They'll let us know by month end
if any revisions are required.

840
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,505
We'll need to speed things up,

841
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,758
to ensure we launch before
Plus General Insurance, no matter what.

842
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,843
-Right.
-However, given that the risk data

843
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,804
we have at the moment is incomplete,

844
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,639
I anticipate it will take some time.

845
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,349
[sighs] Is that so?

846
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:39,435
Then I'll get our external teams
to coordinate

847
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,437
and to collect
the additional data that's required.

848
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,522
Okay. Great.

849
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,024
So how did she seem in person?

850
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,110
Far more determined than we thought.

851
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,320
When we explained
the 90-day exemption period,

852
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,988
she said she'd file a claim right after.

853
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,907
We even suggested couples therapy,

854
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,535
but she firmly declined.
She wants this divorce.

855
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:56,661
Okay. Thank you.

856
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,539
What about the husband?

857
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,874
Uh, yeah, the thing is… [inhales sharply]

858
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,211
…the husband also seemed super positive
about the concept of divorce.

859
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,338
Even when I mentioned
all of its drawbacks,

860
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,799
he seemed, well, completely unfazed.

861
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,927
[sighs] Okay, well, and I'm not certain,

862
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,597
but it seems like
he might be seeing another woman.

863
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,099
Hold on, another woman?

864
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,851
It's true.

865
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,310
He disappeared with a woman.

866
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,771
[sighs] He didn't disappear.
You caused us to lose him.

867
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,524
This is why I don't want to
get married, like, ever.

868
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,984
Regardless…

869
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,527
From what I observed,

870
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,321
Ms. Woo didn't seem quite ready
for such a huge change.

871
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,115
What do you mean by that though?

872
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,868
She didn't seem to have
any grasp of financial matters

873
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,411
as if she'd been living in a bubble.

874
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:42,123
Above all, despite everything,
she seemed to still care for her husband.

875
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,417
[Ah-young] She's right.
I thought about that too.

876
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,252
She still cooks lunch and dinner for him,
for one,

877
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,462
she takes care of the house,

878
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,840
keeps talking about him, saying
"my husband this" and "my husband that."

879
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,009
[Dae-bok] Of course.
She's lived with him for a lifetime.

880
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,761
Do you really think she'd change overnight

881
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,596
-just because of some divorce papers?
-[sighs]

882
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:00,725
Honestly, considering her age, it would be
troubling if her habits changed overnight.

883
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,310
[Na-rae sighs]

884
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:04,645
What's important to us in this matter,

885
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,898
is that the divorce is legally finalized.

886
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,400
Not whether
they will end up living happily.

887
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:10,568
That's the issue.

888
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,071
I agree with you.

889
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:16,365
[chuckles]

890
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,826
-[Dae-bok] I mean…
-[Ki-jun sighs]

891
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,537
…don't just sit there with blank faces
doing nothing. Show more…

892
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,749
Show more energy and figure out
a way to resolve this, will you?

893
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,376
Ugh, you're all so seriously frustrating.

894
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,796
Hey, Noh Ki-jun, got any ideas for us?

895
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:32,006
If we can't stop
this divorce from happening…

896
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,633
We have to stop it!

897
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:36,803
If we can't stop this divorce
from happening…

898
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,722
What the…
I said we have to stop it at all costs!

899
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,769
Section Two. The scope of the coverage.

900
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,063
Section Two, what are the exact terms?

901
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,900
"The insured person under this contract
must be an adult male or female

902
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,361
between 18 and 80
and must not be currently involved in

903
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,613
any affair or relationship
outside of their marriage."

904
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,697
Hmm.

905
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,494
-[sighs] Don't tell me…
-That's the answer.

906
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,288
-What's the answer?
-Affair, sir.

907
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:05,581
[Dae-bok] What?

908
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:08,209
If we can prove that her husband
is having an affair,

909
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,795
then we can invalidate this contract.

910
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,004
What do you mean "invalidate"?

911
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,006
We don't terminate it. We declare it void.

912
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,800
Huh, not bad.

913
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,636
If the contract is declared void,
then that's that.

914
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,556
Since it's not a termination,
it won't affect us in any way.

915
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,349
Bingo.

916
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,853
[exclaims, laughs]

917
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:30,147
Amazing! Hey, Noh Ki-jun,
you're truly a genius!

918
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:31,858
[laughing]

919
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:33,526
There, we have our plan.

920
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,695
We dig up anything
that even smells like an affair,

921
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,738
-and void the contract entirely.
-[Jeon-man sighs]

922
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,408
I guess we're digging into
people's private lives now.

923
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,910
Do we have to go to such lengths though?

924
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,787
[Jeon-man] What?

925
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:48,124
I mean, do we really have to go that far
and risk hurting Ms. Woo?

926
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:51,502
She's must be struggling as it is,
especially with her decision to divorce.

927
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,170
We have to.

928
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,048
If it ensures the project's success.

929
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,636
Even if Ms. Woo won't be able to
receive the benefits herself?

930
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,390
To allow others like Ms. Woo to benefit,

931
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,226
the product needs to
officially be launched.

932
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,690
If we don't launch the product,
it's not really a product.

933
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,734
Just a prototype.

934
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,243
[sighs]

935
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,921
[clears throat]

936
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,297
[car alarm beeps]

937
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,343
[engine starts]

938
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,356
Ms. Woo!

939
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,024
Were you at the grocery store?

940
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,152
-What?
-You got your groceries, didn't you?

941
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,364
-Oh… [chuckles] …I guess I did.
-[chuckles]

942
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,324
So, what's up? Had lunch yet?

943
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:07,578
Yeah, sure. It's way past lunch now.
It's time for dinner.

944
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,829
What about you, Ms. Woo?

945
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:12,041
Oh, well, I… Um…

946
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:14,919
By the way, what's the date today?

947
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,879
Today? It's the fourth.

948
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:22,468
[gasps] Oh, my God. The anniversary of
my mother-in-law's passing is in two days.

949
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,220
[sighs] I need buy some rice cakes.

950
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,139
By the way, tell me, how did you like it?

951
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:29,392
Huh? Like what?

952
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:32,269
Oh, I'm talking about the comforter.

953
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,438
You know, the one Dr. Park bought
the other day?

954
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,734
-Comforter?
-Oh, come on.

955
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:40,695
The hotel bedding set.

956
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,282
What are you talking about?
What comforter?

957
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:48,494
[scoffs] Oh, the comforter
imported from Italy,

958
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,496
that he got just a few days ago, huh?

959
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,752
[sighs] Uh…

960
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,046
What did he get now?

961
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,756
A comforter.

962
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,926
The one from… Actually…

963
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:08,139
[stammers] I must've confused him
with a different customer.

964
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,017
Gosh, I'm all over the place.
Time to cook dinner now. [laughs]

965
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,101
if you'll excuse me.

966
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,437
[footsteps running away]

967
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,243
Mm-hmm.

968
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,415
-Thank you, sir.
-All right. Goodbye, sir.

969
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,669
[door locks]

970
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,633
[sighs]

971
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,603
-I'll head out first.
-Sure.

GUEST FEEDBACK CARD

973
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,779
You're being really cute right now.

974
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,923
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

975
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:31,555
IT'S CUTE

976
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:33,933
TRAVESTY

977
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,017
Wha…

SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR
JEON NA-RAE

979
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:39,063
Oh, damn it.

980
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,232
God. Now what? [grunts]

981
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:47,321
[muffled screaming]

982
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,449
[panting]

983
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:53,494
Die!

984
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:56,914
Die, you idiot.

985
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,041
[phone buzzes]

986
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,918

[heartbeats thumping]

990
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,620
Calling a man cute is the kiss of death.

991
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,716

SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR

00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,097
[sighs]

994
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,434
I hate complicated situations like this.

995
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,561
[romantic music playing]

996
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,063
[doorbell rings]

[music ends]

998
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:48,711
Are you here to grab something or…

999
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,172
Yeah, my watch. I…

1000
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:57,553
-It's already on your wrist though.
-Um, yeah, I suppose it is.

1001
00:59:58,429 --> 00:59:59,596
[both chuckle]

1002
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:02,891
[scoffs] I need my alarm clock.

1003
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:04,310
You took it the other morning.

1004
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:05,894
Right.

1005
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,607
[sighs]

1006
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,777
I'm actually not here to get anything.

1007
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,240
So, uh, why are you here then?

1008
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:19,908
[sighs] I came to apologize.

1009
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:23,620
For earlier, I disappointed you, didn't I?

1010
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,498
[sighs] No.

1011
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:28,375
I wouldn't say I felt disappointed,

1012
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:31,628
I was just… I was a bit thrown off.
You seemed different.

1013
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,799
Or I guess I didn't know you at all
to begin with.

1014
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,764
Ms. Kang, take a seat.

1015
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,773
Uh…

1016
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,193
This might sound like an excuse,

1017
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,070
but it was the best I could come up with,

1018
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:59,031
considering failure
isn't an option for us.

1019
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,992
But, you know, I kept wondering
if stopping the divorce…

1020
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,287
was really the right thing to do.

1021
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:09,333
And so, that's why I came up with
a way for us to succeed,

1022
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:10,667
even if the divorce goes through.

1023
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:14,421
If he's really having an affair,
then even if she were to get a divorce…

1024
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:18,217
[inhales sharply] I didn't think
it was going to be this burdensome.

1025
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,303
I… [sighs]

1026
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:23,889
I'm a coward.

1027
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:28,018
You're not.
I had no idea that was your intention.

1028
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:29,228
[scoffs]

1029
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,649
There's a reason
Jeon-man calls me a Travesty.

1030
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,485
Sophistry, self-realization…

1031
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,613
I get away with stuff like that
all the time, you know?

1032
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,698
I must have misunderstood you.

1033
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,828
It's all good. You don't have to be sorry.
I didn't come here for that.

1034
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:50,124
I was simply concerned that

1035
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,293
you might have been upset because of me.

1036
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,129
That look you had earlier.

1037
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,506
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

1038
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:01,969
I was just…

1039
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,347
looking for answers, you know?

1040
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:07,975
[sighs]

1041
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,186
Why was I so upset?

1042
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:15,524
It's only work,
so why did it affect me like that?

1043
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:19,486
If it had been Mr. An or Ah-young
instead of you, would I have felt…

1044
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:22,656
the same way?

1045
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,204
[inhales sharply]

1046
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:30,789
It's because it was you.

1047
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:37,296
[Ki-jun inhales sharply]

1048
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,342
I can't be "zone" after all.

1049
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,138
Actually, I don't want to.

1050
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,848
[theme music playing]

1051
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:34,645
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK YOUNG-KYU
AND CHA MI-KYEONG

1052
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:35,771
FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

1053
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:05,551
House swapping?

1054
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,261
Yet Ki-jun's stuff is all still here.

1055
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,846
-You and Ms. Kang…
-What's going on between you two?

1056
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,431
-You see…
-You see…

1057
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,475
Don't fall for me.

1058
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,935
I don't know how to do that.

1059
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,729
I think that love is meant to be silly.

1060
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:20,440
Let me get this straight,
you're both from an insurance company?

1061
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,568
That's why you wanted to get divorced?

1062
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:25,153
Well then, does this mean we've succeeded?

1063
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,156
Not quite yet. We've got
a real challenge ahead of us now.

1064
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,449
A challenge?
